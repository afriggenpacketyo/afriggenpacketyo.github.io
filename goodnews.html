          <p>China's Generation Z is driving a significant economic boom in the doll fashion market, with young consumers like Clementine Cai investing substantial amounts, sometimes over 3,000 yuan, solely on doll attire. This trend, fueled by the aesthetic appeal and enjoyment of dressing up ball-jointed dolls for photography, has translated into remarkable sales figures. Major e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall reported a more than 117% year-on-year surge in doll clothing sales in 2024, with monthly sales exceeding 10 million yuan (approximately US$1.4 billion) by May. This burgeoning industry underscores the considerable economic influence of youth culture and niche hobbies in the Chinese economy, showcasing a unique consumer behavior that is transforming a niche interest into a powerful market force.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a positive opening, tracking Wall Street's gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a potential easing of monetary policy next month during his Jackson Hole speech. This indication, driven by concerns over a dramatic deceleration in hiring, has spurred investor optimism across global markets. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng are expected to open higher, reflecting this positive sentiment. This follows a strong close on Wall Street, where the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all saw significant increases, with attention now turning to Nvidia's upcoming earnings report.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggling offense found its stride in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, avoiding a sweep and regaining a first-place tie in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts had challenged his team to display more competitive at-bats and a renewed team-first mindset, which materialized in a crucial nine-hit, four-walk, eight-run outburst. The turning point came in a five-run seventh inning, where Dalton Rushing broke a 2-2 tie with a three-run home run, quickly followed by Freddie Freeman's second long ball of the day. This offensive resurgence, after two low-scoring losses, demonstrated the team's ability to combine disciplined approaches with their characteristic slugging power, offering renewed hope for their season.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France has seen over 70 medical miracles recognized by the Catholic Church in 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually seeking healing. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates thousands of reported cures, distinguishing those with no known medical explanation based on strict criteria of sudden, complete, and lasting recovery. Two new miracles were recognized since 2022, bringing the total to 72. Despite skepticism regarding historical rigor, studies, including one by Dr. Esther Sternberg, affirm the credibility of the office's meticulous, evolving evaluation process, highlighting the enduring mystery and profound impact of these unexplained recoveries on individuals and faith.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a prolific Broadway stage manager, producer, and director for decades, passed away peacefully in his sleep at 96, leaving behind a remarkable legacy in entertainment. He later transitioned to a successful acting career in his 60s, famously portraying Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" across all six seasons and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Adler's extensive theater background included working on 53 Broadway productions, such as "My Fair Lady," with luminaries like Marlene Dietrich and Julie Andrews. His unexpected pivot to acting in his later years, after contemplating retirement, brought him consistent work for over three decades, fulfilling his belief that "retirement is a road to nowhere" and allowing him to achieve a unique form of immortality on screen.</p>

          <h2>Corpus Christi Officials Consider Reinstating Street Maintenance Fee for Repairs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 18:30:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corpus Christi city officials are actively considering reinstating a street maintenance fee, which was eliminated from utility bills in 2024, to address a projected $15 million shortfall in residential street repair funding by fiscal year 2027. The previous fee, around $5.30 monthly, generated about $12 million annually for street improvements. City staff now recommend reimplementing the fee and raising it to $6.60 per month, which could effectively close the funding gap. However, Mayor Paulette Guajardo and Councilman Gil Hernandez oppose the fee, suggesting alternative funding like bond programs or adjusting the general fund reserve, arguing against adding to residents' already increasing utility bills, which already face proposed increases for water, wastewater, and stormwater services.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs of the season against the Athletics, establishing a new single-season record for catchers in major league history. This achievement surpasses Salvador Perez's 2021 record and also marks Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game, setting a record for switch-hitters. The first-time All-Star, who recently signed a six-year, $105 million contract, has launched 40 homers while playing catcher this year, placing him among elite Hall of Famers like Johnny Bench and Mike Piazza. Raleigh's consistent power hitting positions him to potentially become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, formed southeast of Bermuda on Saturday and is currently moving north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday evening, Fernand was located approximately 295 miles east of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 60 miles from its center. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will continue its north-northeast path for a day or two before turning northeast, strengthening slightly through Monday before likely weakening on Tuesday. Critically, Fernand is expected to remain over open waters, posing no immediate threat of landfall to coastal areas, offering relief to populated regions.</p>

His extensive shopping list, including multiple TVs, laptops, and appliances, triggered American Express security, who suspected fraud. O'Neal had to explain that he was indeed the one making the substantial purchase. This anecdote highlights the stringent security measures of credit card companies and serves as a humorous reminder of O'Neal's lavish spending habits, contrasting with his later reputation for financial acumen and charitable contributions.</p>
