          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year, surpassing expectations. This growth rate was the highest in the G7, but the US tariffs and domestic tax increases are expected to slow growth in the coming months. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the services sector drove much of the growth. While the stronger-than-expected growth figure has tempered market expectations for further interest rate cuts, a recent deal with the US may alleviate some tariff concerns.</p>

          <p>Liz Stead, 78, unknowingly had a criminal record for 56 years for being a lesbian in the military and is encouraging more women to apply to a government pardons scheme. She was thrown out of the RAF in 1969 when a love letter from her girlfriend was discovered. She learned of her conviction when applying for financial redress as a veteran sacked during a ban on homosexuality in the armed forces. Stead is now encouraging other women who may have been in contact with police or discharged from the military for their sexuality to apply for pardons to uncover potential unknown convictions.</p>
