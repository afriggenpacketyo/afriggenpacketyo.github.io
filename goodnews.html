        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bald eagle has been officially designated as the national bird of the United States, a move that holds special significance for many Native American communities who have long revered the eagle as a sacred messenger to the Creator. For many Indigenous peoples, the bird is a powerful symbol of strength and spirituality, and its feathers are bestowed in ceremonies to mark important life achievements. While the eagle has been a national symbol since 1782, this formal recognition is seen by some, like members of the Prairie Island Indian Community, as a hopeful sign that could foster greater respect and unity in a divided nation.</p>

          <p>With the NFL committing to send its players to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics for flag football, Major League Baseball is facing pressure to do the same for baseball. Despite stars like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge expressing interest, MLB has not yet agreed to let its top players participate, a decision that could cede the spotlight to other sports. The primary conflict appears to be logistical, as the Olympics occur mid-season, and financial, as MLB controls its own successful international tournament, the World Baseball Classic. LA28 officials and others argue that the Olympics offer an unparalleled global marketing opportunity to elevate the sport.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 06:53:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make buying an electric car cheaper, aiming to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel vehicles. While she did not confirm reports of a new grants program, she guaranteed that announcements later in the week would focus on affordability. The government also plans to invest £63 million in charging infrastructure, including £25 million for "cross-pavement gullies" to help people without driveways install charge points. The move comes as manufacturers struggle to meet mandated EV sales targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.</p>

          <p>German authorities have announced one of the country's largest-ever drug seizures, discovering 300 kilograms of Captagon pills worth an estimated €20 million hidden in a grocery store in Saxony-Anhalt. The amphetamine, in the form of 1.7 million pills, was found concealed among pallets of fruits and vegetables. In separate news, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court is set to rule on whether the government must prevent the US from using its Ramstein Air Base as a data relay point for drone strikes in other countries. The case was brought by Yemeni citizens who argue Germany has an obligation to protect their right to life.</p>

          <p>This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., centered on the theme of youth and the future of culture, showcasing artisans from the Global South who are mentoring the next generation. The event featured a diverse group of participants, including a Guatemalan Maya artist teaching mural painting, Bolivian rappers blending hip-hop with indigenous languages, and fourth-generation Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton. The festival provided a platform for these artists to share their craft, discuss the importance of preserving cultural traditions, and inspire young people to connect with their heritage in a modern context.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring additional measures to protect children online, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. This comes as new age-verification rules under the Online Safety Act are set to take effect on July 25, requiring platforms to implement stricter checks and filter harmful content from children's feeds. The media regulator Ofcom has vowed to rigorously enforce these new requirements. However, Alexander stated that these rules are just the "foundation" and not the "end of the conversation," with the Technology Secretary looking into further actions to address issues like addictive online habits among young people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is establishing a new state agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness, an issue consistently ranked as a top concern by residents. Governor Gavin Newsom's reorganization plan splits the unwieldy Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two, creating a new Cabinet-level secretary focused on housing. Supporters believe this will elevate the issue to the highest level of state government and is a crucial first step toward streamlining the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing finance system. Critics, however, are skeptical that a bureaucratic reshuffle alone will solve California's deep-seated housing affordability and construction cost problems.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist argues that LeBron James, now playing on a one-year expiring contract for the first time in his career, should consider how to manage the end of his career by looking at Kobe Bryant's example. The article notes that the Lakers did not offer James an extension, suggesting the team is now built around Luka Doncic and may view James's contract as an albatross. It recalls how Bryant announced his retirement early in his final season, which allowed him to control the narrative and experience a celebrated farewell tour. The author suggests this approach could provide a graceful exit for James and give the Lakers a head start on rebuilding.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are creating "cyborg" jellyfish by embedding microelectric controllers into the animals, allowing them to be remotely guided to collect environmental data from the ocean's depths. Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, they are ideal subjects for this bio-inspired engineering. The low-cost, scalable devices could revolutionize ocean monitoring, making it more accessible to smaller labs and conservation groups. The team is currently working on improving the device's durability for deep-sea pressures and developing a steering mechanism to provide full three-dimensional control over the jellyfish's movement.</p>

          <p>The final fight in the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy is framed as a transcendent moment for women's boxing, not for its chaotic drama, but for its tactical maturity. The author argues that true equality in the sport is the right for female fighters to be strategic and "win ugly," just as men do, without the pressure to constantly provide a spectacle. However, the article also points to the sport's contradictions, where elite fighters earn millions while undercard athletes struggle financially, and sexist imagery persists. It concludes that by fighting for their own glory and legacy, Taylor and Serrano reclaim their bodies and challenge traditional notions of womanhood.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of the planet Mars ever found on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York. The rock is estimated to sell for between $2 million and $4 million. It is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This single meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material currently on our planet.</p>

          <p>After a four-decade-long conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish state and initiated a disarmament process. The move, which follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a major opportunity for reconciliation. The PKK has laid out demands, including Ocalan's release and amnesty for fighters, while the Turkish government remains cautious. Analysts believe a successful peace process could not only resolve the domestic conflict but also improve Turkey's strained relations with Kurds in Iraq and Syria, enhancing its overall status in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>On its 40th anniversary, the 1985 Live Aid concert is being remembered as a landmark event that united the globe through music for famine relief, but its legacy is also being viewed through a more critical lens. While the concert raised millions and put humanitarian issues on the political agenda, it has since been criticized for its lack of diversity, featuring almost no African or female performers, and for promoting a "white savior" narrative of Africa. Organizer Bob Geldof defends the event's impact, which included lobbying for debt cancellation, but acknowledges its model may not be replicable in today's more fragmented and cynical social media age.</p>
