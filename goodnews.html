        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes an increase to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000. This change, part of President Trump's tax package, would primarily benefit residents in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The proposal may face challenges in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Department of Education. The judge's ruling prevents the planned reduction-in-force (RIF) and the transfer of federal student loans and special education functions out of the department. The judge stated that the RIF would likely cripple the department, which was already struggling to meet its goals. The ruling requires all fired federal employees from the department to be reinstated. The Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, previously slashed nearly $1 billion in funding from the department and terminated dozens of contracts and grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has hit a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has continued to climb, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. The cryptocurrency has seen strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and a significant increase in Bitcoin holdings by public companies. Favorable U.S. crypto regulation, supported by President Trump, and JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin have also contributed to the rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. Home Office statistics showed there were 32,345 asylum seekers living in taxpayer-funded hotels in March 2025, down from 38,079 in December 2024. Ministers hope that speeding-up, coupled with the evolving measures to combat cross-channel boats, will ultimately slash the numbers in hotels.</p>
