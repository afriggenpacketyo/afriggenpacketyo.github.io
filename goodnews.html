          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, remains hopeful about the future of technology, particularly in AI and biotechnology, despite the ongoing tech war between the U.S. and China. Diamandis emphasizes the universal nature of human biology, math, physics, and chemistry, suggesting that breakthroughs in one country can benefit humanity as a whole. He acknowledges concerns about cuts to scientific funding in the U.S., specifically at the National Institutes of Health, and their potential long-term implications on the pace of scientific discovery. Diamandis aims to help people see the world differently by focusing on the positive aspects of technological progress and innovation.</p>

          <h2>Universities Cutting Courses May Lead to Subject 'Cold Spots'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 20:58:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by Universities UK warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more effectively to deliver courses amidst a challenging financial situation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed support for collaboration where possible, acknowledging the financial difficulties facing the higher education sector. The report suggests that greater collaboration between universities could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient, preventing isolated decisions about course closures or mergers. Increased collaboration may involve universities agreeing to specialize in specific subjects to avoid duplication and ensure cost-effectiveness, ultimately benefiting students by maintaining access to a wider range of courses.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament, joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners of the event. Scheffler's performance was marked by consistency and resilience, as he made only one bogey over the final 40 holes at Muirfield Village. Despite a late challenge from Ben Griffin, Scheffler maintained his composure and closed with a 2-under 70 to finish at 10-under 278. The win marks Scheffler's third in his last four starts, further solidifying his position as the world's number one golfer, and his play style is increasingly being compared to that of Jack Nicklaus.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing to accept the pardon she received for her role in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection on January 6, 2021. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative about the events of that day and undermine the integrity of the federal government. She is working with her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon, stating that she and others present at the Capitol were guilty of unlawful actions. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who have actively sought and utilized their pardons.</p>
