        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has nullified the nearly half-a-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case. While the court upheld the finding of liability for fraud, it deemed the monetary fine excessive and potentially unconstitutional. Other non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York for three years, remain in place. The ruling represents a significant legal victory for the former president, though either side may appeal to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>U.S. sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly rose by 2% in July, reaching 4.01 million units on an annualized basis. This increase is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a marginal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point with improved affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fundraising initiative by the organization FarmKind is promoting the concept of "moral offsetting" for meat-eaters, similar to carbon offsets for environmental impact. The idea allows individuals who feel guilty about factory farming but are unwilling to become vegan to donate money to charities working to improve animal welfare. While the campaign, boosted by podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, has raised over $2 million, it sparks an ethical debate. Critics worry it absolves consumers of personal responsibility, while proponents argue it's a pragmatic way to fund a resource-poor movement and effect change.</p>

          <p>Spurred by the inequities of the COVID-19 pandemic, African nations are making a concerted effort to increase local vaccine and drug production, reducing their heavy reliance on imports. Projects are underway in South Africa, Senegal, Rwanda, and other countries, supported by international partnerships and new funding mechanisms like the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator. Despite this progress, the continent still produces less than 1% of the world's vaccines. Experts emphasize that achieving the African Union's goal of producing 60% of its vaccines by 2040 will require sustained, long-term investment.</p>

          <p>Ethel Caterham, a British great-grandmother recognized as the world's oldest living person, has celebrated her 116th birthday. Born in 1909, she is the last living subject of King Edward VII and has lived through two World Wars and survived a bout of COVID-19 at age 110. Caterham, who lives in a care home in Surrey, marked the occasion quietly with her family. She attributes her longevity to a simple philosophy: "Never arguing with anyone! I listen and I do what I like." The title passed to her earlier this year after the death of the previous record holder.</p>

          <p>The Kiruna Church, a century-old wooden structure in Sweden, has been successfully relocated five kilometers from its original site. This monumental move is part of a larger, multi-year project to shift the entire town center of Kiruna. The relocation was necessary because the ground beneath the old town has become unstable due to the expansion of a massive nearby iron-ore mine. The careful transportation of the historic Sami-style Lutheran church marks a significant milestone in the ambitious and unusual urban planning effort to preserve the community's heritage while accommodating industrial growth.</p>

          <p>Apple has raised the monthly subscription price for its Apple TV+ streaming service to $12.99 in the U.S. and other markets, marking the third price increase in three years. The new price is effective immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers will see the change on their next billing cycle. This move follows similar price hikes by competitors like Netflix and Peacock, as streaming companies seek to fund new content and improve profitability. Despite its popularity, reports suggest the service has been operating at a significant financial loss for Apple.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, has indicated that he is not yet convinced a September interest rate cut is necessary, pushing back against strong market expectations. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid argued that policymakers need more "definitive data" before acting, as he believes inflation is still closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% target. His comments introduce a note of caution amid aggressive pressure from the White House for lower rates. Schmid is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.

          <p>In his directorial debut "Lurker," writer-director Alex Russell explores the toxic dynamics of a parasocial relationship between a rising musician and an obsessive fan who infiltrates his inner circle. Russell, known for his writing on shows like "Beef" and "The Bear," drew from his own experiences as an outsider to examine unspoken hierarchies and jealousies within male friend groups. The film, shot on 16mm to enhance its realism, delves into the unsettling nature of social media-fueled fandom and the desire to belong. Russell aimed to create a story that taps into the universal feelings of being both an insider and an outsider.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. has had a negligible impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and found that killing a wolf saved only about 7% of a single cow, meaning 14 wolves would need to be killed to save one cow. The study also found that public hunting did not reduce the number of times government officials had to be called to lethally remove problem wolves. The findings challenge a key justification for wolf hunting policies and suggest non-lethal methods may be more effective management tools.</p>

The FTC described the cancellation methods, which often require in-person visits or mail, as opaque and complicated.

          <p>Italian police divers have conducted their annual cleaning of the "Christ of the Abyss," a famous bronze statue submerged off the coast of Portofino since 1954. Using pressurized water hoses, the team carefully removed a year's worth of accumulated bacteria and crustaceans from the 2.5-meter tall sculpture. This gentle method, in use since 2004, prevents the damage caused by previous techniques that involved scraping the bronze surface. The statue, located 18 meters deep, is a memorial for those who have died at sea and is one of the most popular diving spots in the Mediterranean.</p>
