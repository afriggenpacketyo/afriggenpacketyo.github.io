          <p>U.S. electricity companies are struggling to accurately forecast the power demand that will result from the artificial intelligence boom, creating a multi-billion dollar infrastructure question. Tech companies are reportedly shopping the same large data center projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to gauge real need and raising concerns about overbuilding costly infrastructure. While experts agree a historic increase in electricity consumption is coming, the uncertainty complicates grid planning and could impact consumer energy prices. The debate continues on whether the surge represents a sustainable transformation or an overstated bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The classic 60/40 stock and bond investment portfolio is facing renewed challenges as gold and cryptocurrencies experience significant rallies. Some market strategists are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, which reduces bond allocation in favor of alternative assets like precious metals and bitcoin. This shift is driven by factors such as persistent inflation, geopolitical risks, and the observation that stocks and bonds are increasingly moving in tandem. The surge in gold prices, fueled by central bank demand and de-dollarization trends, is leading investors to reconsider it as a core holding rather than a fringe asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the recent ceasefire agreement, key regional powers like Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are strategically positioning themselves to influence the future of post-war Gaza. Egypt aims to leverage its role as a mediator to reassert its diplomatic importance and secure international financing for reconstruction projects, utilizing its own construction industry. Qatar seeks to maintain its indispensable role in negotiations, balancing its ties with both the U.S. and Hamas's political leadership. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is working behind the scenes to ensure regional stability for its economic diversification plans, conditioning its involvement on the disarmament of Hamas.</p>

She described her Tuscan property, which she purchased and renovated, as a paradise with fresh air, large gardens, and a vineyard. This lifestyle choice was highlighted by her recent 20th wedding anniversary celebration, which she and her husband spent quietly visiting their favorite spots in Florence and Rome.</p>

          <p>In response to pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug costs, Roche's Genentech is launching a new program to sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to certain consumers at a significant discount. The initiative aims to improve access for uninsured or underinsured patients by offering the single-dose antiviral treatment for a $50 cash price, which is 70% below its list price. The program will utilize partnerships with pharmacies like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Alto Pharmacy for nationwide delivery. This move is part of a broader trend of pharmaceutical companies exploring direct-to-consumer models to address high U.S. drug prices.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," with writer Harlan Coben. In an interview, she explained her motivation to create a female protagonist whose value lies in her unique skills as a surgeon, rather than her sex appeal, contrasting it with the bikini-clad women in James Bond films she watched growing up. Witherspoon, whose production company focuses on female-centric stories, noted that the plot was inspired by her upbringing in a medical military family. The book centers on a talented surgeon facing a career setback who becomes entangled in a dangerous conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive and prolonged Russian air incursions into the airspace of NATO members like Poland and Estonia have been met with a unified and robust response from the alliance. Rather than being intimidated, European leaders have coordinated a more enhanced defense of the eastern flank, scrambling advanced fighter jets to intercept Russian aircraft and shooting down drones. This display of resolve, which some officials say backfired on Vladimir Putin's attempt to divide the allies, has created a rare alignment between European leaders and President Trump on pressuring Russia. The actions signal a more assertive posture as Europe builds up its own military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The third season of the acclaimed HBO series 'Euphoria' has added several new actors to its cast, including Natasha Lyonne, Danielle Deadwyler, and Eli Roth. They will join returning stars like Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney when the show returns in the spring of 2026 after a four-year hiatus. The new season, which is currently in production, will reportedly feature a time jump that moves the characters beyond their high school years. The long delay between seasons is attributed to the rising stardom of its young cast and showrunner Sam Levinson's work on other projects.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, will reportedly run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee, his decision to formally enter the race was apparently accelerated by the entry of another progressive candidate. Pelosi, who is 85 and has represented the San Francisco district since 1987, has not yet announced if she will seek another term. If elected, Wiener, a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, would be the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance on whether debt collectors can pursue legal action against individuals who are already making payments on a delinquent account. While establishing a payment plan is a positive step, it does not automatically protect a debtor from being sued unless a formal, written agreement explicitly states otherwise. Debt collectors may still file a lawsuit to secure a legal judgment, which grants them more powerful collection tools like wage garnishment. To minimize legal risk, individuals should always request payment agreements in writing, adhere strictly to the plan, and understand their rights under both state and federal consumer protection laws.</p>

          <h2>Bodybuilders Shift from 'Dirty Bulking' to Healthier 'Lean Bulking' Methods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 12:24:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bodybuilding community is increasingly moving away from the traditional "dirty bulking" method, which involves consuming massive amounts of calories from any source to gain mass, toward a more moderate approach known as "lean bulking." This newer trend emphasizes a slight caloric surplus from healthy, whole foods to build muscle more slowly while minimizing fat gain. The shift is driven by a growing awareness of the long-term health risks associated with processed foods and a cultural desire to maintain a lean, chiseled physique year-round. However, experts caution that even lean bulking can lead to extreme dieting and body image issues.</p>
