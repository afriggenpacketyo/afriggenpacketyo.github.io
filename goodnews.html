          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, pledging to resolve ongoing border disputes. This marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, following deadly border clashes in 2020 that strained diplomatic ties. Both leaders emphasized focusing on economic development and rebuilding trust, signaling a potential reset in the relationship between the two Asian powers amid their respective trade tensions with the United States. The meeting highlights a strategic effort to stabilize relations and bolster regional cooperation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has caused significant price increases and supply shortages. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the last decade, with tencha, the tea used for matcha, seeing its auction price jump 170% this year. The labor-intensive farming process and an aging agricultural workforce are creating a production bottleneck, forcing retailers to ration supplies. This has prompted major companies like Ito En to create dedicated divisions to manage the intense competition for sourcing and producing the popular green tea powder.</p>

Her entrepreneurial journey began in childhood, trading Pokémon cards on the playground, and evolved into creating websites and bots for online games. She later dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, co-founding the AI data company Scale AI, which was recently acquired by Meta.

The summit provides a platform for Beijing to project regional leadership and counter Western alliances like NATO. For India, the meeting is particularly significant as it navigates steep new US tariffs imposed over its purchases of Russian oil. The gathering, described as the largest in the organization's history, has transformed Tianjin with heavy security and city-wide promotional displays.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 tournament as the "best decision I have ever made," citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give her best for the national team. The 32-year-old, who has since undergone knee surgery and started counseling, emphasized the immense pressure of her leadership roles and the importance of recognizing when to step back to recover.</p>

          <h2>Trump Appointee Resigns from US Foreign Aid Agency After Repositioning It</h2>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee under the Trump administration, has stepped down from his leadership role at the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure. He stated his mission was to reposition the foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool aligned with an "America First" agenda, focusing on countering Chinese influence and ensuring a return on investment for the United States. The MCC, which provides infrastructure and energy compacts to developing nations, has been preserved as a leaner, deal-driven entity, with recent investments in countries like Nepal and Kosovo aimed at bolstering U.S. national security interests.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2 with a stoppage-time penalty, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim but failing to mask significant issues, particularly with goalkeeping. Following costly errors from both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana in recent matches, another mistake from Bayindir allowed Burnley to equalize, highlighting a critical vulnerability for the team. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers and the team as a whole, as the club reportedly pursues a new keeper before the transfer deadline. The victory offers temporary relief ahead of a difficult stretch of upcoming Premier League fixtures.</p>

          <p>Biologists in the western U.S. are experimenting with an unconventional method to protect cattle from gray wolves, whose populations have been recovering. The team uses drones equipped with thermal cameras and loudspeakers to haze the predators at night, blasting sounds ranging from AC/DC's music to dialogue from actor Scarlett Johansson. This nonlethal technique aims to interrupt wolf hunts and reduce conflicts between ranchers and the protected species. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results show promise in fostering coexistence between wildlife and agriculture.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old British Formula 1 enthusiast, Brandon Burgess, is undertaking a challenge to attend every race in the 2025 season on a strict budget of £20,000. By using only his 28 days of annual leave and carefully managing costs through hostels and strategic travel, he aims to demonstrate that following the sport globally can be more accessible than perceived. Having spent just over half his budget with 10 races to go, Burgess is on track but faces the most expensive "flyaway" leg of the season. His journey, documented on social media, has garnered attention from fans and even the Aston Martin F1 team.</p>

The demonstrations highlight ongoing challenges for labor unions, which are grappling with protecting members from the Trump administration's immigration policies, cuts to social services, and a weakened National Labor Relations Board.

          <p>Amid new 50% US tariffs on Indian goods, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit signals a potential economic reset between the two nations. Both India and China are grappling with economic pressure from Washington, creating a shared incentive to repair their relationship, which has been strained by border disputes and mutual mistrust. Analysts suggest that this alignment could mark a turning point, as the world's second and fifth-largest economies explore greater cooperation to diversify their markets and reduce dependence on the United States, potentially reshaping global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans started their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the most points the team has scored in a game since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, never punting, while the defense also impressed with five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the performance was dominant, the lower-tier competition makes it difficult to gauge the team's true strength ahead of more challenging matchups.</p>
