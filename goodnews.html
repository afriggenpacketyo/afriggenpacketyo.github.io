          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, the China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the market consensus that the nation's consumption is underdeveloped. The report argues that mainstream metrics have systematically underestimated China's spending power. When adjusted for purchasing power parity, the country's per capita consumption is actually 40 to 50 percent of the levels seen in developed nations like Japan and Germany, offering a new perspective on the economy's potential.

          <p>Applications to refinance a home loan jumped 7% last week, driven by a drop in mortgage rates to their lowest point since April. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, prompting a surge in homeowners seeking to lower their payments, with refinance demand now 40% higher than a year ago. However, applications for mortgages to purchase a home remained nearly flat, suggesting ongoing uncertainty continues to sideline many potential homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially confirmed that the 600-year-old institution of his spiritual leadership will continue after he dies, ending years of speculation. In a video message ahead of his 90th birthday, he stated that only the trust he founded has the authority to find and recognize his successor, and that no one else can interfere in the matter. This declaration directly challenges China, which has long insisted that it must approve his reincarnation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and urged Hamas to accept the proposal. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, a Hamas official stated the group is ready to reach a deal if it leads to a complete end to the war. The announcement puts pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has long insisted on "complete victory" before ending hostilities.</p>
