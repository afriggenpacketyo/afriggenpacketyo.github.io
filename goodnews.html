        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Liao, HSBC's co-CEO for Asia and the Middle East, emphasized Hong Kong's potential to advance the yuan's internationalization by expanding its offshore liquidity while maintaining risk management. He noted that Hong Kong could scale up yuan-denominated trade finance, building on the yuan's position as the third most used currency for global trade finance. According to an HSBC survey, a significant majority of mainland businesses plan to expand overseas, while both institutional and retail investors intend to diversify their portfolios by allocating assets abroad. Hong Kong's role as a financial hub connecting East and West positions it as a crucial partner in mainland China's capital market opening.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. The challenge, brought by families and private schools, argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The court found that the government was entitled to consider the revenue raised for public services outweighed the impact on families. The government expects to raise ¬£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30, which will be spent on raising standards in the state sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new type of student loan program is emerging that features no interest, no fees, and a "pay-it-forward" repayment model. This program is designed to support low-income students and address worker shortages in critical industries. California is set to launch a similar program in San Diego County. Unlike traditional student loans, repayment only begins once the student earns a minimum salary, and repayments are reinvested into the fund to support future students. However, some concerns include the complexity of implementation and potential impacts on college tuition prices.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing a "Cloudburst Management Plan" to mitigate increased rainfall due to climate change, including cloudburst tunnels and sponge parks. These tunnels and parks are designed to store excess rainwater during extreme weather events.

Copenhagen is also constructing a human-made island, Lynetteholm, to protect against storm surges. The city's long-term climate adaptation planning has gained international recognition, with collaborations and consultations with cities worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully dismantling buildings to salvage reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. This approach reduces waste in landfills and lowers the carbon footprint of construction. Deconstruction creates a circular economy for building materials, offering an alternative to traditional demolition methods. While deconstruction presents challenges, such as the need for local infrastructure and higher costs, it holds promise for reducing the environmental impact of the built environment. Some cities are implementing ordinances to incentivize or require deconstruction practices.</p>
