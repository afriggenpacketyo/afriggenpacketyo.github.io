He stressed that the EU-China relationship should be based on its own merits, especially as both sides mark 50 years of diplomatic relations and ease reciprocal restrictions.

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced that her government is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps, following a decree by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexico asserts that Google should only label the U.S. portion of the gulf as the Gulf of America, while retaining the name Gulf of Mexico for the territorial parts belonging to Mexico and Cuba. Google claims its changes align with the official U.S. government geographic designations, but Mexico's Foreign Ministry had previously requested the company not to apply the new name to Mexican territorial waters.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Diagnosed nearly a decade ago, Laycock's tremors and involuntary movements progressed despite medication. After undergoing DBS, which involves an implanted device delivering electrical currents to the brain, he transitioned to a more advanced form called adaptive DBS (aDBS). This technology fine-tunes stimulation in real-time, reducing the risk of tremors during concerts. Laycock's experience highlights DBS and aDBS as viable options for Parkinson's patients seeking better symptom control and quality of life.</p>

Experts are unsure of the exact re-entry location, but the spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While the spacecraft is expected to mostly burn up, some pieces could survive the re-entry and impact the Earth's surface.</p>
