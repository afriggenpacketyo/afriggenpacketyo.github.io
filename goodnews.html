          <p>Two years after taking a break to focus on his mental health, singer Lewis Capaldi made a highly anticipated surprise return to the Glastonbury festival. He performed for a massive, supportive crowd, opening with his hit song "Before You Go." This appearance follows a difficult 2023 performance where he struggled with his Tourette's syndrome, leading to his hiatus from the spotlight. The comeback was also marked by the release of a new single, "Survive," which addresses his personal struggles and determination to overcome them.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has adjusted his government's proposed welfare reforms after facing significant opposition from his own Labour MPs. The initial plan would have tightened eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. Additionally, the government reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients. While the concessions have satisfied many rebels, some MPs still intend to vote against the bill, signaling ongoing division.</p>

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis has detailed an ambitious plan to revive the truck brand following a significant 38% sales decline since 2019. The strategy includes reintroducing popular Hemi V-8 engines, launching lower-priced models, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new 10-year powertrain warranty. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, aims to increase Ram's full-size truck market share to over 20%. The turnaround also involves delaying the launch of all-electric models in favor of a plug-in hybrid, reflecting current market demand and a focus on core products.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has reined in the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies across the entire country. In a 6-3 decision related to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, the court ruled that such universal orders likely exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion stated that injunctions should typically be limited to providing relief only to the specific plaintiffs in a case. The ruling is a significant check on a judicial tool that has been used to halt major policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>

It detonated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, releasing energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT.

Based on current data, a 65-year-old man could expect around $1,942 per month, while a woman could expect about $1,861, with the difference due to women's longer life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would pay less, around $1,684 monthly.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is less of a clear-cut victory for President Trump than it may appear. While the ruling curtails the ability of a single judge to block a policy nationwide, it leaves open the possibility for broad injunctions when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs, such as states arguing against a patchwork of laws. The author suggests the decision is a serious, albeit delayed, response to the overuse of such injunctions against both Democratic and Republican administrations. It does not resolve the underlying constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda are set to sign a peace agreement in Washington, brokered by the United States. The deal aims to end the conflict in eastern DRC, which has been fueled by the M23 rebel group, allegedly backed by Rwanda. The agreement focuses on respecting territorial integrity and disarming non-state armed groups, but it has drawn criticism for overlooking justice for victims of sexual violence and the displacement crisis. Some analysts view the deal as a transactional, U.S.-led effort to stabilize the region for economic integration, potentially sidelining African-led peace initiatives.</p>
