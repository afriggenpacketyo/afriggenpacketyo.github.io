          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:22:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant decrease in the number of individuals listed as missing following severe flooding earlier in the month. Through extensive follow-up by local, state, and federal agencies, the count dropped from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to verifying that many people initially reported missing were actually safe. The overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try win against the US Eagles in a match disrupted by significant weather challenges in Washington D.C. The game experienced long delays due to lightning and was played in highly humid conditions. Despite the interruptions, the English side, composed of many younger players, demonstrated superior precision, leading to a final score of 40-5. The event also highlighted efforts by World Rugby to grow the sport's audience in the United States ahead of future World Cups being hosted there.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly attack in Southport last year, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to prosecute individuals preparing for mass violence, even without an ideological motive. This new legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who research targets or make plans, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. The proposal is a response to incidents where attackers were fixated on violence itself rather than a specific terrorist cause. The goal is to provide law enforcement with the tools to prevent such tragedies before they occur.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental reset amidst a severe and prolonged batting slump. Betts' performance has been uncharacteristically poor throughout the season, with his batting average and power numbers falling to career lows. Roberts expressed that the decision was made to take the pressure off Betts, hoping that observing a game from the dugout could provide a beneficial change in perspective. The move underscores the team's concern over the struggles of one of its most important players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and holiday costs for parents, and address "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, stress the need for a long break to recharge and plan, and some fear a shorter summer could intensify the rush for vacation time. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of the school calendar in response to modern economic and social pressures.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage more people to invest in stocks and shares, suggesting that savers are missing out on financial rewards due to an overemphasis on risk. The government plans to send information about investment opportunities to those with money in low-interest accounts and has not ruled out cutting the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to push people toward investment ISAs. This has sparked a debate, with some experts warning the push could backfire if not handled carefully, while others highlight the need to make investing more accessible, particularly for women.
