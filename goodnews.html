          <p>Poland's gaming industry is experiencing a paradox, demonstrating remarkable creativity and growth despite a global industry downturn. Developers like Varsav Game Studios, known for "Barkour," highlight Polish ingenuity stemming from a history of resilience and unique perspectives. With around 500 studios and 15,000 employees in 2022, Poland ranks among Europe's top gaming hubs, boasting successes like "Cyberpunk 2077" and "The Witcher." However, the sector faces challenges from post-pandemic oversaturation, rising costs, and investor withdrawals, with indie studios particularly reliant on crowdfunding and hoping for increased government support to sustain their innovative spirit.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. scales back its global clean energy investments, with President Trump criticizing wind and solar as a "scam," Chinese cleantech firms are aggressively expanding into emerging markets across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America. Chinese investors are showing renewed interest in companies like Malaysia's Mabill Technologies, embedding proprietary technologies into local supply chains and promoting Chinese technical standards. This "tech diplomacy" involves joint ventures and Belt and Road-funded infrastructure, aiming to align regional energy systems with Chinese intellectual property. The shift highlights China's ambition to become a dominant hub for clean energy, filling the void left by the US.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has introduced a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, marking the brand's first hybrid system and a strategic move to reverse six consecutive years of sales declines. The new model, produced in Mexico and starting at $36,995, is longer, taller, wider, and boasts 30% more cargo capacity, featuring Stellantis' new 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain offering over 500 miles per tank. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf sees the Cherokee's return as crucial for reinvigorating sales, despite facing headwinds from President Trump's tariffs, which are estimated to impact Stellantis by $1.74 billion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by GiveDirectly in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of $1,871 per household significantly reduced infant and child mortality by 48%, primarily shortly after dispersal. This contrasts with recent US studies on basic income that showed null health effects. While the mechanism isn't definitive, increased hospital deliveries and improved food security are potential factors. However, the study notes that while impactful, the cash program's cost-effectiveness for saving lives ($299,418 per life saved) is not competitive with highly targeted health interventions like Vitamin A supplementation. The article emphasizes modest takeaways, cautioning against oversimplifying cash grants as a panacea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regulators are considering a knowledge test to allow more investors to access private-market assets like pre-IPO companies and hedge funds, traditionally reserved for the wealthy. The U.S. House approved a proposal for the SEC to devise such a test, aiming to ensure investors understand the risks of these less liquid, less transparent, and often higher-risk investments. Currently, accreditation is based on income or net worth, thresholds unchanged since the 1980s. Experts warn that designing an effective test is challenging, given that many consumers struggle with basic financial literacy, and it must adequately protect investors from potential significant losses.
