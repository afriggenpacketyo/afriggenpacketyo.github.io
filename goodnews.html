          <p>Photographer Andrew Fusek Peters spent a decade capturing the beauty and diversity of British back garden wildlife, culminating in his book 'Garden Safari.' The images, taken mostly in his modest Shropshire garden, showcase battling birds, squabbling squirrels, and rare moments like a hare feeding her leveret. Peters, who began focusing on garden wildlife after a cancer diagnosis, uses a unique technique to capture birds in mid-flight, revealing rainbow-like diffraction effects on their wings. His book is a rallying cry to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens, emphasizing the importance of these creatures in the face of climate change and habitat loss. </p>
