          <p>Olympic gold medalist Noah Lyles has called off his highly anticipated speed showdown against Super Bowl winner Tyreek Hill. Lyles cited "complications" and "personal reasons" during an appearance at the Cannes Lions Festival in France. The event was planned to occur in Times Square, with significant promotion and fanfare. While Lyles suggested planning was in its final stages, the race will not occur as intended, leaving the possibility of a rescheduled event unclear.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting, but will likely provide updated economic forecasts. Investors will closely scrutinize the "dot plot" for signals about future rate cuts, particularly in light of geopolitical uncertainties and persistent inflation risks. Market participants will also pay close attention to Chair Jerome Powell's commentary on softening labor data and the potential impact of tariffs. The Fed is expected to remain in a "wait-and-see" mode, assessing incoming data before making any policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars with federal approval. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, requires full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. It grants significant authority to the Treasury Secretary and opens doors for various issuers, including banks and fintechs. While facing hurdles in the House, the bill signals a turning point for crypto and the political clout behind it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming mayoral primary, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters' second-choice votes are counted. This process continues until two candidates remain, with the leader winning the primary. Ranked-choice voting has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a particular candidate from winning.</p>

The real battle is with Nvidia in the AI infrastructure space, with AWS looking to reduce AI training costs and provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, according to AWS, and Project Rainier is powered by over half a million of the chips ‚Äì an order that would have traditionally gone to Nvidia.</p>

The moment occurred while Starmer and Trump were talking to reporters about their newly signed off UK-US trade deal. The new arrangement removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and cuts the levy on cars exported from the UK to the US to 10%.</p>
