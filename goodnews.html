The movie uses a digital aesthetic, shot mostly on iPhones, to create a disorienting experience. While some elements may not fully align, the film's exploration of isolation and its impact on the human mind makes it a compelling entry in the franchise.</p>

          <p>Americans may face higher air conditioning costs this summer due to rising natural-gas prices, with average monthly bills potentially reaching around $200. Experts recommend sealing windows and doors, using fans, managing sunlight, and using heat-producing appliances wisely to reduce energy consumption. Regular maintenance of AC systems, such as changing filters, can also help improve efficiency. Considering upgrading to a more efficient system may be a longer-term solution to lower costs.</p>

          <h2>California Groundwater Supplies Significantly Recharged in 2024</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's groundwater supplies received a significant boost in 2024 due to average precipitation, with an estimated 2.2 million acre-feet of recharge. Local agencies reported that about 1.9 million acre-feet of water went underground through managed aquifer recharge projects. While less than the previous year's extremely wet conditions, the replenishment is helping to curb overpumping in farming areas. The state is implementing water-saving programs and regulations to address groundwater issues, but continues to debate the need for infrastructure modernization.</p>
