          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. This growth, surpassing analyst expectations, was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction. Economists suggest this positive turn was partly due to businesses front-loading exports to get ahead of potential tariffs. Despite the encouraging figures, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year.

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI. However, he suggested that Tesla might hold a shareholder vote on whether the automaker should invest in xAI, following a previous informal poll where a majority of his followers supported the idea. This comes as Musk continues to integrate his various companies, such as merging xAI with social media platform X and planning to feature the Grok AI chatbot in Tesla vehicles.</p>

Ukrainian officials, including President Zelenskyy's top aide, welcomed the visit, emphasizing the "peace through strength" approach and the importance of strengthening the U.S.-Ukraine partnership amid escalating Russian attacks.</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to slow. He stated that the path for interest rates is "downward," citing that the UK economy is growing below its potential, which creates "slack" that helps reduce inflation. This statement comes as official figures show a decline in job vacancies to their lowest level since 2021 and an increase in people available for work. Economists widely anticipate a rate cut at the Bank's next meeting in August. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding analysts' forecasts, largely due to a temporary tariff reprieve with the United States and strong shipments to other regions. While exports to the U.S. fell for a third consecutive month, the decline was less severe than in May. Imports also saw their first growth of the year, rising 1.1%, signaling a potential, albeit slight, pickup in domestic demand. Notably, exports of rare earths surged by 60% to a record high, and steel exports also jumped significantly, despite global trade protections. (not investment advice)</p>

A top commission chaired by President Xi Jinping stated a need to regulate "disorderly and low-price competition" and guide the exit of outdated production capacity. This rhetoric is reminiscent of the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" which targeted excess capacity in industries like steel and coal.
