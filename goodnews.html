          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny is using his latest album and a 30-show concert residency to spotlight Puerto Rico's ongoing struggles with its colonial status, gentrification, and economic hardship. His music directly addresses the displacement of locals and the erosion of cultural identity, resonating deeply with residents who feel their concerns have been ignored. The artist's focus on the island's issues has elevated the conversation to a global stage, sparking hope among many Puerto Ricans that his influence could lead to meaningful change.

          <p>The Chicago Sky achieved a significant upset, defeating the top-ranked Minnesota Lynx with a final score of 87-81. The victory was powered by strong double-double performances from Angel Reese, who recorded 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Kamilla Cardoso, who contributed 17 points and a career-high 15 rebounds. This win marks only the second time this season that the Sky have secured back-to-back victories and is a notable success against a team with one of the best records in the league. The Lynx, led by Napheesa Collier's 26 points, have now lost two of their last three games.</p>

          <p>The third Test match between England and India at Lord's ended its third day with heightened drama over alleged time-wasting tactics. England's Zak Crawley deliberately delayed play to ensure he and his partner would only face one over before the close, angering Indian players. However, England's bowling coach pointed out that India had engaged in similar tactics earlier in the match, suggesting they had no grounds to complain. The tense exchange, which included heated gestures, has added a much-needed spark to the series, which is currently tied at 1-1.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has announced that the 2026 World Cup will utilize indoor, air-conditioned venues as much as possible for daytime matches to protect players from extreme heat. This decision comes after concerns were raised about player welfare during the current Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures have been dangerously high. The plan will affect games held in the four host cities with indoor stadiums: Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver. The strategy is a direct response to the challenges posed by summer temperatures in the tournament's North American host nations.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed tariff campaign, including a 30% levy on EU and Mexican goods, the stock market has remained near record highs, avoiding the panic seen in April. This article suggests investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating style and are focusing on broader economic policies. Analysts point to deregulation and a permissive stance on artificial intelligence as major drivers of market optimism, fostering growth and M&A activity. The analysis concludes that investors are prioritizing the positive implications of these policies on corporate earnings over the disruptive rhetoric on trade. (not investment advice)</p>
