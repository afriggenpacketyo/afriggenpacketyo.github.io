          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, suggests that Joe Biden showed signs of cognitive decline well before leaving office, raising questions about his fitness to serve as president. The authors claim that some individuals behind the scenes questioned Biden's capacity to fulfill his presidential duties, describing a stark contrast between a 'fine Joe Biden' and a 'nonfunctioning Biden.' This account has sparked debate about when these alleged cognitive issues became a significant concern and whether they were adequately addressed during his time in office.</p>

          <p>On, a Swiss sportswear brand, is emerging as a strong competitor to established giants like Nike and Adidas, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative shoe designs and strategic timing, capitalizing on Nike's sales decline and Adidas's challenges with the Kanye West partnership. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market, On's rapid growth has outpaced both companies in recent quarters, though On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and possible tariffs due to its manufacturing in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still grappling with police reform. Police Chief Brian O'Hara is focused on internal changes to improve safety and community relations, acknowledging that Floyd's death remains an "open wound." Despite shootings trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by an officer shortage. O'Hara is working to restore pride in the profession, adjust arrest tactics, and enhance community engagement and officer training. The Justice Department is ending investigations and canceling consent decrees, but O'Hara insists reform efforts will continue.</p>

          <p>According to David Marcus, eliminating taxes on overtime pay could be a significant political move for the GOP, potentially helping them gain support in the midterm elections. This policy change is frequently mentioned by working Americans and employers, suggesting it could be more impactful than other tax-related measures. Regular workers view this as a direct raise, allowing them to plan their finances more effectively. If implemented by the fall of 2026, Republican candidates could use this as a key talking point against Democratic incumbents.</p>

          <p>A record number of Americans are seeking residency in the United Kingdom, with over 6,000 applying for British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain in the year leading up to March.

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline after a spike during the pandemic, with murder rates falling to levels on par with pre-pandemic figures. The FBI's 2023 crime report showed a nearly 12 percent year-over-year decrease in murders, and early numbers for 2025 suggest a continued downward trend. Factors contributing to the decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and government initiatives to stem violence. Despite the positive trends, public perception often lags behind reality due to bad news bias.</p>

          <h2>Republicans Rush Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Through Congress</h2>

          <p>Republicans in Congress rushed President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" through the House, mirroring and exceeding procedural misdeeds they previously accused Democrats of committing. The final text of the 1,100-page bill became public just hours before the vote, with a pivotal hearing scheduled for 1 a.m. Despite criticisms about the process, most Republicans ultimately voted in favor of the bill. The GOP's aggressive drive to pass Trump's agenda fits a pattern of using alleged Democratic transgressions as justification to go even further.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Public Again</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 08:15:01 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, aims to release the firms from federal oversight, potentially benefiting investors. However, critics warn that privatizing Fannie and Freddie could disrupt the mortgage market and increase rates. The government has controlled the two firms since bailing them out during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a milestone in underwater communication by enabling error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement could pave the way for real-life applications of long-range undersea messaging, with significant implications for both civilian and military purposes.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a sudden weight gain of 40 pounds in weeks, leading to a diagnosis of pericardial constriction after open-heart surgery. The rare condition, where the sac around the heart thickens, prevented his heart from fully opening, causing swelling. A cardiothoracic surgeon performed a pericardiectomy to remove the scar tissue, restoring heart function. After his recovery, Mauceri has returned to conducting and feels stronger than ever.</p>
