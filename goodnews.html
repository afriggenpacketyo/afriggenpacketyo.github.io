          <h2>Survey Shows German Employees Largely Unconcerned About AI Job Displacement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 07:13:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A recent survey by health insurer AOK reveals that only about 5% of German employees are worried that artificial intelligence could threaten their jobs within the next five years. Despite studies suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in Germany involve tasks that could be automated, the majority of workers expressed little to no concern, with many admitting to having limited knowledge or training regarding AI. This widespread complacency has surprised some experts, who warn that AI systems could eventually take over more complex professional roles.</p>

          <p>China's military is training soldiers to become "human abacuses" by using an ancient mental calculation technique to ensure operational readiness in combat scenarios where technology might fail. A recent state broadcast showcased a drill simulating radar failure, in which a soldier mentally calculated the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds, enabling precise targeting without modern equipment. This initiative is being highlighted as part of a broader effort to bolster military resilience and confidence in low-tech and analogue operational capabilities.</p>

          <p>California has passed a set of new laws aimed at increasing online safety for children, with a focus on regulating artificial intelligence and social media platforms. One landmark bill requires AI chatbots to disclose they are not human and to prompt minors to take breaks, while other legislation mandates mental health risk warnings on social media apps and increases penalties for deepfake pornography. These laws also compel device makers like Apple and Google to implement age verification tools in their app stores, reflecting growing concerns over technology's impact on youth.</p>

          <h2>Nobel Prize in Economics Awarded for Research on Technology-Driven Growth</h2>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been co-awarded to economic historian Joel Mokyr for his work explaining why the Industrial Revolution began in Britain and spurred sustained economic growth. Mokyr's research emphasizes that Britain's success was not just due to scientific breakthroughs during the Enlightenment but also because it had a skilled class of mechanics and entrepreneurs who applied these new ideas practically. This environment, combined with political institutions open to disruptive change, allowed for the process of "creative destruction" that fuels long-term prosperity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are managing a unique eight-day road trip, staying in Baltimore after their game against the Ravens to prepare for their upcoming matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.

This strategy, which the Rams have successfully employed in previous seasons, is designed to minimize travel fatigue and help players acclimate while fostering team cohesion in an unfamiliar environment.</p>

          <p>A new drug named lenacapavir, administered as an injection just twice a year, has demonstrated nearly 100% effectiveness in preventing HIV infection in clinical trials. This breakthrough offers a powerful alternative to daily PrEP pills, overcoming challenges of consistent access and adherence that have limited the reach of current prevention methods. While the drug has been approved by regulators, its global impact will depend on political will and equitable distribution, as access for low-income countries is being navigated through programs like PEPFAR and licensing deals with generic manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Dorothee Elmiger has been awarded the prestigious German Book Prize for her novel "Die Holländerinnen" (The Dutch Women).

The jury praised the novel as a "fascinating journey into the heart of darkness," lauding Elmiger's disturbing exploration of fear, violence, and the failure of narratives in a style that is both distant and gripping.</p>

          <p>Perimenopause, the transitional stage before menopause, can significantly affect mental health due to drastic hormonal fluctuations. Erratic levels of estrogen and progesterone can lead to symptoms like anxiety, depression, irritability, and brain fog, often catching people by surprise. These mental health challenges are compounded by physical symptoms such as hot flashes and insomnia, which disrupt sleep and further exacerbate mood swings. Experts recommend tracking symptoms, adopting lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and consulting a doctor to rule out other conditions and explore treatment options.</p>
