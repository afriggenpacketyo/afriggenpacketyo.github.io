          <p>The UK government is considering a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales. The new strategy includes mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70, who could be banned if they fail. Additionally, the plan proposes lowering the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These changes follow a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current driver licensing system as excessively lax after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, scientists theorize that newly formed black holes produce a unique form of 'music.' This phenomenon is not sound but rather gravitational waves that ring out as the nascent black hole settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape after its creation from a star's collapse or a merger. This process smooths out any initial irregularities, and the resulting vibrations in spacetime could soon be detectable, offering a new way to observe and understand these enigmatic cosmic objects.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. This initiative is expected to have a more significant economic impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger percentage of household income. For example, the payment constitutes over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poorer province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. This disparity suggests the policy could stimulate consumption and potentially birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is aggressively pivoting the Japanese conglomerate to focus on artificial intelligence, believing that artificial superintelligence (ASI) will arrive within a decade. Son's strategy involves a comprehensive portfolio of AI-related investments, from chip designers like Arm and Ampere to a significant stake in OpenAI, aiming to create a powerful, integrated AI ecosystem. This high-stakes gamble follows a period of heavy losses for SoftBank's Vision Fund but reflects Son's long-held belief in the transformative power of AI, which he now sees as central to the company's future success.

          <p>The 911 emergency system in Redondo Beach, California, was briefly knocked offline on a Sunday afternoon following a fire at a nearby AT&T communications center in Gardena.

Redondo Beach police confirmed that the outage had a minimal impact, making 911 calls intermittent for about an hour before service was fully restored.

The result was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with a one-stroke lead. A late bogey on the 17th hole caused Fleetwood to finish one shot out of the playoff, extending his wait for a first win on the PGA Tour.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures aimed at making it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The changes, which include cutting red tape and allowing trusts to hire proactively based on anticipated needs, address a growing mismatch where there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. This situation arose from a surge in trainees during the pandemic combined with lower-than-expected attrition rates. While nursing unions welcomed the move, employer groups raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

The boat's operator reported that two large waves hit the stern, disrupting its course and causing it to lose propulsion after grounding.

The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, and Adidas has since contacted Oaxacan officials to discuss restitution.

          <p>According to historian Rana Mitter of Harvard Kennedy School, the impact of World War II on China is a pivotal yet often underestimated factor in understanding the nation's modern development. Mitter's research focuses on the consequences of Japan's invasion, arguing that the conflict shattered the infrastructure and communications networks built in the preceding decades. This widespread destruction effectively forced China to start its post-war development from a state of near-total ruin, profoundly influencing its subsequent political and societal trajectory.</p>
