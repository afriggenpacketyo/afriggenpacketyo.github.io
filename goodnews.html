          <h2>German Military Survey Finds No Systemic Extremism But Reveals Problematic Attitudes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 04:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that the German military does not have 'systemic' extremism within its ranks, with only 0.4% of soldiers showing right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the report also found that 6.4% of soldiers hold 'consistent chauvinist attitudes,' and 3.5% have 'consistent xenophobic attitudes.' While the survey authors suggest the German military has stronger anti-extremism measures than most, some researchers are skeptical, noting the survey's voluntary nature and the potential influence of heightened political scrutiny on right-wing extremism within the Bundeswehr. The study interviewed over 4,300 military personnel and conducted small group discussions at eight different military bases across Germany to come to its conclusion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards, in this New York Times article, contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Fueled by 'flygskam' (flight shame), Europe is expanding its night train network to compete with short-haul flights in terms of speed, cost, comfort, and environmental impact. Meanwhile, America continues to prioritize cars and underfund public infrastructure, leading to increased congestion and a decline in driver satisfaction. The article argues for greater investment in rail networks and subway systems in the US, drawing lessons from China's successful high-speed rail system.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. Projects such as Nairobi's mega-highway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are examples of this trend. During Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought Chinese funding for the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) extension, with Chinese contractors expected to operate the railway for at least 25 years to recoup their investment.</p>

Despite broader luxury shoppers pulling back, the super-rich are maintaining their spending on the most desirable items.
