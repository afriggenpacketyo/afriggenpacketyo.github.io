          <p>The Wimbledon women's final features a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. The article analyzes the contest, highlighting Swiatek's experience against Anisimova's underdog freedom and aggressive playstyle. It suggests the outcome may depend on who better manages the pressure of their first Wimbledon final, noting that while Swiatek has more major titles, Anisimova's journey back from a mental health break allows her to play without heavy expectations. The piece also explores why Wimbledon often produces first-time champions, citing the short grass-court season.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, described as "Australia first." Ahead of a state visit to Beijing, Albanese invoked the legacy of wartime leader John Curtin, emphasizing the need to act in Australia's strategic interest rather than being defined by traditional alliances. This recalibration aims to balance relationships with both the U.S. and China, asserting Australia's independent course in an era of global uncertainty. The policy comes as his government navigates the complexities of the AUKUS security pact while seeking stable trade with China.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with non-speaking autism and apraxia, has been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For 14 years, Viraj was unable to communicate effectively, leading doctors to believe he was severely mentally disabled. His single father, Sumit Dhanda, persisted until he discovered Viraj could type with his right thumb, unlocking his son's profound intelligence. In just three years, Viraj progressed from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect ACT score, and graduated high school. Viraj hopes his story will highlight the hidden potential within the non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has enhanced its security protocols. The agency has introduced a fleet of military-grade drones for aerial surveillance and mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement. These changes address critical failures identified from the 2024 incident, where the shooter operated a drone undetected and communication gaps existed between agencies. The Secret Service recently suspended six personnel following an internal investigation and stated these new technologies are crucial to preventing a repeat of the attack.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two semi-autonomous XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination in a training environment. This push is part of a broader race with China to achieve air dominance through human-machine teaming. The Valkyrie drone platform is a key component of the U.S. Air Force's effort to explore how uncrewed aircraft can augment and support crewed fighters in complex missions.</p>

His statue will stand among existing monuments that predominantly honor white men, many of whom have connections to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era.
