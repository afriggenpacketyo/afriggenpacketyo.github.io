          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation arises after his predecessor's dismissal due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, which angered consumers. The survey also reveals that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The public's response reflects concerns over rising living costs and the government's efforts to stabilize the rice supply.</p>
