          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the identification of 38 new mineral reserve locations within the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant reserves of rubidium and gold, are part of the country's strategy to enhance its resource security. Investment in mineral exploration saw a substantial rise, particularly for critical elements like tin, copper, and tungsten, which are vital for high-tech and green energy industries. This initiative reflects China's commitment to strengthening its national energy and mineral resource independence amid a global race for critical materials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a tentative ruling suggesting she will order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests of immigrants in the Los Angeles area. The lawsuit, brought by civil rights groups, argues that federal agents have been targeting brown-skinned individuals without probable cause, creating fear and harming the community. The judge appeared critical of the government's lack of specific evidence to justify the arrests during a hearing. This potential injunction is a significant development in the legal battle against the administration's mass deportation strategy, with a final order expected soon.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project, when a section of the tunnel caved in, trapping 27 workers who were later joined by four colleagues attempting a rescue. A large-scale response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, led to the safe recovery of all individuals with no visible injuries. The project is now on hold as Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by the California Board of Parole Hearings. Bianchi, now 74, and his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. were responsible for the sexual assault, torture, and murder of 12 women in the 1970s. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the board determined Bianchi remains a risk and will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years. Buono died in prison in 2002 after being sentenced to life without parole, while Bianchi received a potential for parole as part of a plea deal.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, with an expected price of up to $4 million. This rare meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all Martian material known to exist on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. The auction highlights the immense scientific and collector value of such objects, which provide invaluable data for understanding the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science made an unexpected and rare paleontological discovery directly on its own property. While drilling a deep borehole to explore geothermal heating potential, a core sample revealed a fossilized vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago. Museum officials described the find as incredibly unlikely, comparing it to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon, given the narrowness of the drill core. The hockey-puck-shaped fossil, believed to be from a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, is now on display, adding a unique, homegrown specimen to the museum's collection.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang held a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, coinciding with his company becoming the first to close a trading day with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The context for the meeting was not officially disclosed, but it occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration has restricted sales of certain processors for national security reasons, effectively cutting off a significant market for Nvidia. President Trump praised the company's stock performance, linking it to his tariff policies in a social media post. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are operational again after being knocked down by high winds 14 months ago. Hundreds of locals and tourists gathered to watch the restored sails turn, an event celebrated with a can-can performance by 60 dancers in the street and fireworks from the cabaret's roof. The original blades collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but new aluminum sails were installed last summer. However, delays with a new electric motor kept them motionless until now, marking the full restoration of a beloved Parisian landmark.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Formula Behind Effective Political Campaign Slogans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for successful political slogans by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. The research suggests eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—resonate most effectively with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. These words act as "emotional shortcuts," though they don't guarantee victory on their own. The article contrasts this formulaic approach with memorable, purpose-built slogans like "Get Brexit Done" and discusses how AI is now being used to create hyper-targeted messages, potentially changing the nature of political sloganeering.</p>

The application to the Arizona Department of Transportation covers operations both with and without human safety drivers. This move follows the launch of a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where Tesla has been testing its camera-based autonomous driving system with invited passengers and an in-car supervisor. While Tesla aims to catch up in the self-driving race, its initial efforts have faced some documented issues, including a minor collision and traffic violations.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea, the country with the world's lowest birth rate, is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. This trend is attributed to a generational shift where individuals, facing social and financial pressures, are delaying childbirth and then turning to medical technology like IVF to start families later in life. While the government is subsidizing treatments to combat the demographic crisis, patients still face significant financial and workplace challenges.</p>
