          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the concept of federal rental aid with time limits, focusing on the Delaware State Housing Authority's program as an example. The program includes a work requirement, regular financial check-ins, and a savings component where monthly payments stay flat, allowing participants to save money over time. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering expanding time limits and work requirements nationally, housing policy experts express concerns about their effectiveness and potential consequences for renters. The article highlights both the successes and challenges of implementing time limits in rental assistance programs, referencing experiences in Washington state and Delaware. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Yankees star Alex Rodriguez discusses the pressure on Aaron Judge to perform well in the postseason to solidify his legacy as a true Yankees legend. Rodriguez, drawing from his own experiences of struggling in the playoffs before winning the 2009 World Series, believes Judge needs a defining October moment. While Judge's regular-season numbers are impressive, his postseason performance has been lacking, and Rodriguez suggests that overcoming this hurdle will cement his place in Yankees history. Rodriguez also touches on the Yankees' recent struggles against the Los Angeles Dodgers and the absence of Gerrit Cole from the pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the country's liquor industry, with a growing preference for low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages over traditional baijiu. Farmers in Baisha, known for baijiu production, are shifting from sorghum to green plums to cater to this trend. Industry insiders say that younger consumers are prioritizing self-indulgent experiences over social rituals, leading to a shift in alcohol consumption patterns. More Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to this younger demographic, focusing on lighter and fruitier options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on Ncuti Gatwa's brief but impactful tenure as the Fifteenth Doctor on the British series Doctor Who, highlighting his significance as the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the role. Gatwa's Doctor brought a refreshing queerness to the franchise, embracing a more emotionally available and fashion-forward persona. The author argues that Gatwa's casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anybody, confronting racism and privilege in ways previous Doctors had not. Despite a somewhat rushed ending, Gatwa's contribution to Doctor Who is celebrated for expanding the series' notion of limitless possibility.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's planned military parade in Washington, D.C., could be a patriotic celebration and an opportunity to counter misperceptions about the armed forces. While acknowledging concerns that Trump may use the parade to intimidate critics, the author suggests it could also bring Americans closer to service members and boost military recruitment. With the military facing recruitment challenges, a celebratory parade could familiarize civilians with their armed forces and draw talented young Americans to serve. The author emphasizes the importance of looking past the president's potential solipsism and embracing the men and women who defend the United States.</p>

          <p>The NHS app in England will become the primary communication method for millions more patients, saving the health service ¬£200m over three years. This ¬£50m investment will enable more test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders to be sent directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters, and the changes are expected to free up NHS phone lines. This move aims to modernize patient care and improve access to healthcare management, with over 11 million people logging into the app monthly.</p>
