          <h2>Japan's Gen Z Prioritizes Work-Life Balance, Embracing 'Quiet Quitting'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting the concept of 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. This shift marks a departure from the traditional Japanese work ethic of long hours and unwavering loyalty to employers, with many young people valuing experiences like travel and socializing over professional success. Factors contributing to this change include witnessing their parents' sacrifices for companies, the rising cost of living, and a desire for greater personal fulfillment. The coronavirus pandemic has further prompted some to question their priorities, leading to a reevaluation of work's role in their lives, with the added benefit of potentially reducing 'karoshi,' or death by overwork.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 7-5 victory against the New York Mets in 13 innings, enduring a lengthy rain delay and significant strain on their pitching staff. Starter Clayton Kershaw's outing was cut short due to the delay, and closer Tanner Scott blew a three-run lead in the ninth. Despite these challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hern√°ndez driving in the go-ahead run in the 13th. The article notes the win comes at a cost, potentially exacerbating existing pitching staff issues amid a demanding schedule against playoff-contending teams.</p>

          <p>This article explores the unique dynamic between local football players and the fans of their hometown clubs, using the example of Brighton's Lewis Dunk. While playing for your boyhood club can be a dream come true, it also brings added pressure and scrutiny from fans who expect immediate success. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher notes that players may sacrifice opportunities for other clubs to maintain their connection with local supporters. Former Norwich striker Chris Sutton emphasizes the intense attachment and responsibility local players feel, playing not just for the club but for their community and family.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with stories about government spending cuts and their potential impact. The Daily Mail reports on a conflict between Angela Rayner and other government officials over budget reductions. The Guardian highlights concerns that delaying the child poverty strategy could increase the number of children in poverty. Conversely, The Times focuses on a positive development: plans to establish mental health A&Es across the UK to alleviate pressure on hospitals. Other headlines include Donald Trump's threats of higher EU tariffs, an interview with the Princess of Wales' brother, and Feargal Sharkey's prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government-held rice stockpiles directly to retailers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. This initiative comes amid criticism that the government has not effectively curbed the spike in rice prices, which have nearly doubled due to a poor harvest and increased demand. The government intends to release 300,000 tons initially, with potential for additional supplies, and is exploring online sales to ensure widespread access. However, analysts caution that the limited reserve amount may not significantly impact overall rice prices.</p>

          <p>China has officially greenlit a 767-kilometer canal project connecting the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal province of Zhejiang, aiming to improve logistical efficiency and integrate inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is part of a larger effort to connect Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water and is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of 320 billion yuan. The canal will enable the transport of resources from Jiangxi, a manufacturing hub with rare earth and copper reserves, to seaports in Zhejiang, one of China‚Äôs wealthiest provinces. </p>
