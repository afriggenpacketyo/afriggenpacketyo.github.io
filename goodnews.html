          <p>BBC Sport previews the Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham, highlighting the underperformance of both teams this season. Sami Mokbel argues that Tottenham's season has been unacceptable, despite a potential Europa League victory, while Simon Stone contends that Manchester United's struggles are largely self-inflicted due to managerial changes and poor player performance. The article points out that injuries have debilitated Tottenham's season, while United have struggled with consistency and financial losses. Both correspondents agree that winning the Europa League would provide some redemption, but questions remain about the future of both clubs and their respective managers. </p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its "retention scheme" that would have paid significant bonuses to senior executives, following criticism from the government and the public. The scheme, potentially worth up to ¬£1 million per executive, was linked to securing a ¬£3 billion rescue loan for the troubled company. Downing Street stated that rewarding executives for mismanagement was unacceptable. The company will await guidance from Ofwat, the regulator, to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations and turnaround objectives, as Thames Water has faced heavy criticism for sewage discharges and leaks. </p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after making a controversial remark about not buying rice because he received it as gifts from supporters, which was seen as insensitive given rising rice prices. The comment came at a sensitive time as the public struggles with record-high prices for the staple food, causing political fallout for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government ahead of a crucial national election. Eto clarified that he does buy white rice and that his comment referred to brown rice, which he wants people to consider. Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former Environment Minister, is expected to succeed Eto. </p>

It is designed to detect amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals at least 55 years old exhibiting signs of the disease. The test is expected to be more accessible and less expensive than PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially speeding up the rollout of new Alzheimer's treatments. </p>

          <p>This Guardian article argues that media attention on young men supposedly driving the rise of the far right is misplaced. While a gender gap exists in support for far-right parties, the more significant trend is a sharp leftward shift among young women. Centre-left parties should focus on the priorities of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than catering to reactionary politics. This strategy could transform political debate and encourage greater participation from young women, who often abstain from voting more than young men. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market. This is because workers are increasingly seeking a more balanced lifestyle away from China's major coastal cities. Chengdu has earned the reputation of being "China's happiest city" and its appeal reflects a budding disillusionment among young people. With an influx of transplants and returnees, housing prices in Chengdu have increased at a faster rate than in any other major city in China. </p>
