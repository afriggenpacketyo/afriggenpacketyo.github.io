          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama has officially announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, confirming that a successor will be identified through traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices. This declaration, made ahead of his 90th birthday, ends speculation that he might be the final Dalai Lama and is a direct challenge to Beijing's claims that it has the sole authority to approve the next leader. The decision is politically and spiritually significant for Tibetans who oppose Chinese rule. China's Foreign Ministry quickly reiterated its stance that the reincarnation must be found within China and approved by the central government.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon championships have showcased divergent paths for two British tennis players, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal. Boulter, the British number two, suffered a disappointing second-round exit after letting a lead slip, marking the second consecutive year she has failed to reach the third round. In contrast, 23-year-old Sonay Kartal is enjoying a breakout performance, defeating a top-20 opponent and advancing to the third round for the first time. Kartal, who largely self-funded her early career, credits her unconventional path with helping her mature quickly and is now thriving on the big stage.</p>

          <p>A new poll from the University of California Irvine indicates that former Vice President Kamala Harris would be the frontrunner in the 2026 California gubernatorial race if she chooses to enter. The survey shows Harris with 41% support against an unnamed Republican candidate and leading a field of announced Democratic candidates with 24% of the vote, despite 40% of voters being undecided. Her high name recognition is a significant advantage, with only 5% of Californians unfamiliar with her, compared to nearly 50% for other potential candidates. Harris is expected to announce her decision by the end of the summer.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a 10-year plan for England's National Health Service (NHS) aimed at shifting care from hospitals to local communities. The strategy involves creating around 200 new neighborhood health centers staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, pharmacists, and mental health specialists. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the NHS must "reform or die," with the goal of providing more convenient care and reducing hospital waiting lists. However, organizations like the Royal College of Nursing have raised concerns, warning that the plan will be impossible to implement without concrete policies to address the currently depleted healthcare workforce.</p>

          <p>The historic Griffith Park Pool in Los Angeles, which has been closed since 2020, will not reopen and is set to be demolished. City officials have announced a $28-million plan to replace the 1927 facility with two new, smaller pools and a splash pad, along with a reconstructed pool house. The original pool was found to have a severely cracked foundation that could not be repaired, preventing it from retaining water. The new, modern facility is designed for year-round use and is projected to be completed in early 2028, addressing years of community complaints about the loss of the popular public amenity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on goods imported into the United States. This levy is lower than the 46% rate that was set to take effect next week. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on products that are made in other countries, like China, and then trans-shipped through Vietnam to avoid duties. In exchange, the U.S. will reportedly gain zero-tariff access to Vietnamese markets, a development that could impact major brands like Nike and Apple that have significant manufacturing operations in the country.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration policy that severely restricted migrants' ability to seek asylum at the U.S. southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" outside of the law. The policy was based on a presidential executive order declaring the situation at the border an "invasion." The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal, but the ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda.</p>

In the post, he stated that all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Los Angeles needs a new, technology-driven strategy to address the crisis of illegal fireworks, which cause fires, injuries, and distress to residents and pets. The author, from the safety organization MySafe:LA, notes that despite education and enforcement, the problem is worsening. The piece proposes that L.A. should adopt a model similar to the city of Riverside, which uses surveillance drones to capture violations in real time and mail citations to offenders. This approach would increase deterrence and accountability without straining public safety personnel, which is especially critical with upcoming global events like the World Cup and Olympics.</p>

His innings featured a false shot percentage of just 3.5%, far below the average of 12%, outperforming modern greats like Joe Root and Steve Smith on this metric.
