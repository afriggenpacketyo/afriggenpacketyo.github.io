          <p>After a six-year development period marked by intense fan anticipation and online speculation, the video game 'Hollow Knight: Silksong' has finally been released to widespread critical praise. The article details the fervent online culture that grew around the game's prolonged absence, which only amplified its eventual launch. The sequel to the 2017 hit 'Hollow Knight,' 'Silksong' is described as a mercilessly difficult but fair game with deep exploration and a unique, devotional atmosphere. The review commends the small three-person development team, Team Cherry, for creating a product that rivals and often surpasses those from much larger studios.</p>

          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen gently chided fans who left their game against the Baltimore Ravens early, before the team orchestrated a dramatic comeback victory. The Bills were down 40-25 in the fourth quarter, but Allen led the team to score three late touchdowns, culminating in a game-winning field goal. After the thrilling win, Allen remarked, "I think there’s people who left the stadium. That’s OK. We’ll be fine. But have some faith next time."

          <p>Designers of China's J-35 stealth fighter jet have revealed that the carrier-borne aircraft is capable of carrying up to six air-to-air missiles in its internal weapons bay. This detail was shared on a program by state broadcaster CCTV, which showcased a model of the jet featuring folding wings and a tailhook for carrier operations. The six-missile capacity matches the loadout of the United States' F-22 stealth fighter, indicating a significant advancement in China's naval aviation capabilities. The disclosure came after the J-35 was featured in a major military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about high interest rates and inflation, financial experts are advising consumers on practical ways to curb credit card spending. Key strategies include creating a detailed seasonal budget by reviewing past expenses and separating needs from wants. Another effective method is to use debit or cash for non-essential purchases to create a stronger emotional connection to the money being spent. Experts also recommend removing saved credit card information from online shopping accounts to add friction to impulse buys and setting up transaction alerts to track spending in real-time.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Monday, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both showing gains of around 0.6%. Investor focus is on France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is widely expected to lose a parliamentary confidence vote later in the day over a contentious plan for €44 billion in budget cuts. If the government falls, President Emmanuel Macron will need to appoint his fifth prime minister in under two years. The market movement comes ahead of key U.S. inflation reports due later in the week, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a traditional wig striking a protester on the ground, with blood splattering from their placard. Banksy claimed the piece on Instagram, his usual method of authentication, shortly after it was discovered. The politically charged mural was quickly covered with plastic sheeting by authorities. Its appearance follows a recent protest against the ban on the group Palestine Action, where nearly 900 people were arrested, continuing Banksy's theme of critiquing government power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, the key to being highly likable is not about being overly agreeable but about making others feel seen and valued. This is achieved through small, consistent habits that demonstrate genuine interest and respect. These habits include remembering small personal details about others, freely giving credit to colleagues for their ideas, and responding to everyone regardless of their status. Additionally, likable people readily admit when they are wrong, which builds trust, and they make time for seemingly unimportant conversations, which humanizes them and strengthens relationships over time.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence has generated concerns about job displacement, labor economists argue that its current impact on the overall workforce remains relatively small. Experts suggest that the recent slowdown in the job market is more attributable to broader economic uncertainty than to the widespread adoption of AI technologies. Although some AI-driven layoffs have occurred, they have been largely concentrated within the tech sector itself, which constitutes a small fraction of the total U.S. workforce. Instead of replacing workers, many employers are focusing on retraining staff and integrating AI as a tool to augment human labor.</p>

          <p>India is actively rebalancing its relationships with major global powers, particularly strengthening ties with China and Russia, as its relations with the United States face strain over new tariffs. The Trump administration's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods has prompted New Delhi to pursue a policy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy. Foreign policy experts note that India is not abandoning its partnership with Washington but is hedging its bets to navigate an unstable global landscape.

          <p>A comparison of monthly running costs reveals that charging a Tesla electric vehicle at home is more economical than buying gasoline for a Honda CR-V Hybrid. Based on average American driving distances and current energy prices, charging a Tesla costs approximately $50.75 per month, while fueling the CR-V Hybrid costs around $81.20. The primary reason for the difference is the higher energy efficiency of electric motors compared to internal combustion engines. While public fast-charging can be more expensive, the analysis highlights the potential savings for EV owners who primarily charge their vehicles at home.</p>
