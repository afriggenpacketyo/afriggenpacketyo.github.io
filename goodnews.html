          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating the US would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, more than double the current number. This message came shortly after the Chinese embassy in the US warned its students about 'unjustifiable questioning and harassment' at Houston airport. Trump expressed a desire for improved relations with China, indicating his administration aims to 'get along good' and acknowledging an invitation to visit China from President Xi. The move suggests a potential de-escalation in US-China educational and diplomatic tensions, despite recent reports of student scrutiny.</p>

These drugs, used for diabetes and obesity, are showing potential for treating various other conditions like Psoriasis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, sparking a new era of drug innovation and job creation. Goldman Sachs projects GLP-1s could boost US GDP by 0.4% through increased productivity and healthcare savings, despite their high cost. The drugs are also significantly impacting consumer spending, particularly in the food and beverage industry, and raising concerns about socioeconomic inequality in access to these life-changing medications.

          <p>Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, a long-sought Mexican cartel kingpin, pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom to US drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for his role in fueling violence and drug distribution. Zambada, 75, admitted to leading the Sinaloa cartel with Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, transforming it into a global drug trafficking organization responsible for transporting at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine. His plea, which came after prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, is hailed as a landmark victory by US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Zambada is scheduled for sentencing on January 13, facing a life sentence and billions in financial penalties.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in 'invisibility technology' for Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft, making their radar signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. This innovation utilizes a new frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, which assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, creating a chaotic signal at a distance. This technique aims to obscure the directional origin of the aircraft's emissions, effectively making the platform behave like a 'phantom' to adversaries. The development marks a 'paradigm shift' from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability of these critical command nodes in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean and poses no threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday evening, Fernand was located about 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, moving northeast. Forecasters predict it could become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating on Wednesday. Fernand is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which NOAA had forecast to be above-normal, following Hurricane Erin earlier in the month.

This restriction is due to the combustible nature of these power sources, which can overheat and pose a fire risk. If such devices ignite in checked baggage within the cargo hold, detection and intervention would be significantly delayed. Plug-in tools remain unrestricted, but for cordless versions, a safety cover must be securely fitted over the heating element.

The withheld money, intended for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-learner support, had left many communities uncertain about sustaining vital services for approximately 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families. The agreement marks a victory for states that argued the administration lacked the constitutional authority to unilaterally freeze designated funds.</p>
