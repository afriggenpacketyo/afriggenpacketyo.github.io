          <p>Oman has become the latest Gulf state to launch a "golden visa" program, aiming to attract wealthy foreigners, including Americans, by offering residency in exchange for significant investment. To qualify, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in property, bonds, or businesses that contribute to local employment. The program is part of a broader strategy to boost private sector growth and offers perks like fast-track airport services and property ownership in previously restricted areas. Experts note this trend reflects a growing desire among the wealthy for global mobility and financial security.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," stars Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr, exploring a crisis point in his life after his first professional loss. The drama, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, delves into Kerr's struggles with substance abuse, relationship anxieties with his girlfriend played by Emily Blunt, and the existential challenge of losing. The review notes Johnson's casting as inevitable due to his physique but points out that the film doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of the characters, focusing more on the fighting.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed deals to send two of its high-profile forwards to other clubs, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli on loan and Antony moving to Real Betis permanently. Hojlund's deal includes a £38m obligation to buy, while Antony's transfer is valued at £21.65m. Both players, who were expensive signings for United, struggled to find consistent form at Old Trafford and were deemed surplus to requirements by manager Ruben Amorim. These moves are part of a broader overhaul of the club's attacking lineup.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed his support for citizens flying national flags like the Union Jack and St. George's Cross, calling them a great symbol of patriotism. However, he cautioned that their value is diminished when they are used "purely for divisive purposes," a comment made in the context of flags being displayed during protests against asylum hotels. Starmer, who noted he has a St. George's flag in his Downing Street flat, aims to balance national pride with concerns that flag-waving has become contentious and, in some cases, linked to xenophobia.</p>

          <p>A fact-checking investigation has determined that long-standing online claims about former first lady Melania Trump working as an escort and meeting Donald Trump at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell are unfounded. These allegations, which resurfaced in 2025, originated from a 2016 tabloid article and were later amplified by others. However, Melania Trump successfully sued the original publishers for defamation, resulting in retractions and damages. Reports from multiple sources confirm the couple was introduced by a former modeling agent, not at a Maxwell-hosted event.</p>

Despite the continuity, Donald warned the US team not to expect a "rinse and repeat" performance, stressing that playing on American soil at Bethpage presents a different challenge requiring a new strategy. He acknowledged the pressure of the away crowd but urged his players to embrace the atmosphere. The only new face on the team is Rasmus Højgaard, who replaces his twin brother, Nicolai.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to criticize a new policy in the province of Alberta that requires school libraries to remove books with "explicit sexual content." The move came after her iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was among over 200 books removed from Edmonton public school shelves under the new rule. Atwood's new story sarcastically describes "very good children" who grow up without any biological realities, taking aim at the ban's restrictive nature. The incident reflects a growing trend of book challenges moving from the U.S. into Canada.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that the body sizes of wild and domestic species began to evolve in opposite directions during the Middle Ages. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for agricultural purposes. This divergence highlights the profound and lasting impact of human activity on the natural world.</p>

The leaders discussed regional stability and bilateral trade, with Putin hailing the "special, friendly and trusting" ties between the nations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has scrapped its more expensive peak-time fares, allowing passengers to travel at any time for a single, lower price. The move, made possible by post-pandemic shifts in travel patterns that have left more capacity on commuter trains, has reduced the cost of some key routes by more than half. This initiative has sparked a debate about whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided on whether it would lead to overcrowding on busy routes or require overall price increases to compensate for lost revenue.</p>
