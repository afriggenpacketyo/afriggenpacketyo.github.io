          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant jump in premarket trading following a positive earnings report, which triggered a rally in semiconductor stocks worldwide. The company's strong earnings and revenue, despite facing challenges from U.S. export restrictions to China, have positioned Nvidia as a bellwether for the semiconductor industry. This surge has positively impacted other semiconductor companies globally, including Tokyo Electron, SK Hynix, ASM International, BE Semiconductor Industries, and ASML, all of which saw gains.

          <p>Global financial markets responded favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs under an emergency-powers law. U.S. futures jumped, oil prices rose, and the U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen and euro following the decision. While the White House appealed the ruling, investors seemed encouraged by the prospect of reduced trade tensions, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index and South Korea's Kospi surging. The court's decision cast doubt on trade policies that have caused market volatility and uncertainty over inflation and global economic growth.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. This ruling, based on cases brought by small businesses and state governments, marks a major legal challenge to Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. While the Trump administration plans to appeal, global markets have responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets rising and the US dollar gaining strength.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform the pension industry by creating ¬£25 billion "megafunds" to invest locally and fuel economic growth. These reforms, inspired by Australian and Canadian models, aim to improve pension returns and channel more investment into clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the largest pension firms have agreed to the plan, the government may use legislation to ensure progress by the end of the decade. This approach is expected to increase investment in UK infrastructure and potentially boost workers' pension pots. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision has implications for global commerce and financial markets, with analysts suggesting it throws Trump's trade policy into turmoil. The court's ruling leaves in place other tariffs, including those on steel, aluminum, and autos, but it strikes down the broader levies imposed on most trading partners. Experts say that the ruling highlights the limits of executive power and could impact future trade negotiations.</p>
