          <p>Australia, despite its small population, has produced a surprising number of Hollywood stars, including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett. The article explores the reasons behind this phenomenon, highlighting the influence of institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), which provides rigorous training and encourages a "can-do" attitude. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from the intense scrutiny of Hollywood. There is an understanding that it's all oftentimes smoke and mirrors. And it's fun, and it's a game. </p>

          <p>Robots are transforming the art world, enabling sculptors to carve with precision and speed, but this development has sparked debate among artists. Companies like Robotor use robots to complete 99% of the work on sculptures, but some artists worry about the loss of human touch and artistry. Barry X Ball, a contemporary artist, embraces robots to create complex works, while others, like Tuscan artist Michael Monfroni, argue that only a human can coax the divine out of stone. The use of robots has divided the artistic community, raising questions about the nature of artistry and the role of technology in creative expression. </p>

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecast, potentially making the northern lights visible across much of the northern U.S., as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm is spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the storm, and elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event. The northern lights are best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning. </p>

Many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models, and they are also looking to other markets like Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
