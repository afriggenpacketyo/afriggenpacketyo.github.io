          <p>Extreme heatwaves, particularly in Europe, are causing travelers to reconsider their holiday plans, with 81% of Europeans adjusting their travel due to climate change. Some are choosing destinations with milder weather or traveling during cooler months, such as Easter instead of summer. Experts suggest that parts of Europe may become too hot for comfort in the future, leading to shifts in tourism patterns. Resorts are adapting by offering evening activities and investing in winter connectivity, while staycations and travel to less traditional destinations like Scandinavia are gaining popularity.</p>

The extension aims to ensure a deal is closed, addressing concerns that the app could be used by China for spying and manipulation. Trump stated that he believes China will approve the deal. This decision contrasts with Congress's previous support for a sale-or-ban measure, and some analysts doubt a ban will ever occur under Trump's administration.</p>
