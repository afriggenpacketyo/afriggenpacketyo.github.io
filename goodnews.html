          <p>China and Israel are actively working to restore balance in their diplomatic and economic relationship, which has been strained by the Gaza war and increased scrutiny from the United States. China's ambassador to Israel, Xiao Junzheng, has been fostering goodwill through visits to joint infrastructure projects, including the Tel Aviv light rail and the Haifa port container terminal, the latter raising security concerns in Washington. These efforts underscore a mutual interest in maintaining and expanding technology and trade cooperation, initially established under a comprehensive innovative partnership in 2017.

          <p>Chinese investors and consumers are experiencing a "gold fever" as prices hover near an unprecedented US$3,900 an ounce, leading to a mix of excitement and trepidation. Many are frustrated by missed opportunities to sell earlier or are wary of the current record-high rally, struggling to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold their gold assets. One Guangzhou engineer, Yue, sold 200 grams predicting a price correction, only to see it climb higher, leading him to switch to silver.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's justification for the deployment, citing "war-ravaged Portland" and the need to protect immigration facilities, was "untethered to the facts" and likely exceeded his constitutional authority. The judge emphasized the country's tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs, asserting that protests in Portland, while inexcusable, do not warrant such federal intervention without the governor's approval. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, celebrated the decision as a victory for state sovereignty and constitutional law.</p>

The forum, attended by leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, underscored the union's influence in California politics. Key pledges included support for a state constitutional amendment aiding UC workers with home loans and commitments to join impending Kaiser health employee strikes.</p>

          <p>The Mirage 2000, a highly agile and effective fighter jet, was manufactured by the French aerospace company Dassault Aviation, with production spanning multiple facilities in France. The Saint Cloud location developed the prototype in 1977, Argenteuil built the fuselage, and Mérignac handled final assembly and flight testing. Designed to replace the Mirage III, the Mirage 2000 boasted speeds exceeding Mach 2 and exceptional low-speed handling, making it versatile for combat. While the Mirage 2000 is now nearing the end of its service, Dassault's Rafale fighter has emerged as a popular and advanced successor, capable of superior aerial and ground attacks, reconnaissance, and nuclear deterrence. The article provides a detailed look at this iconic aircraft.</p>

          <p>Waiting in line for hours is evolving from an inconvenience into a social and exciting activity, particularly for exclusive retail events. People are embracing long queues for the "anticipation" and "reward" of luxury items, bargains, or unique experiences, driven by the release of dopamine. This trend fosters camaraderie, allowing individuals to meet new people and form communities. Brands are leveraging this by creating "experiential marketing" events with free products, limited stock, and interactive elements, turning the queue itself into social media content. The article explores how consumers find joy and connection in these collective waiting experiences, highlighting a shift in cultural perception.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest US Lutheran denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for the predominantly white church. Curry, who previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first woman leader. His six-year term, which began October 1, comes as the denomination faces challenges common to mainline Protestant churches, including membership declines and theological debates over LGBTQ+ inclusion. Curry's unique path to leadership, having grown up Catholic and entering ministry through a diverse congregation, highlights the ELCA's efforts to foster new and multicultural ministries and increase diversity within its leadership.</p>

          <p>The previously winless UCLA Bruins delivered a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, revitalizing their season under interim playcaller Jerry Neuheisel, who was elevated to the role just four days prior. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava, running a new aggressive offense, accounted for five touchdowns—three rushing and two passing—in what was described as his finest college performance. The team's resilience and belief, despite an 0-4 start, were credited for the remarkable turnaround. This unexpected win, their first against a top-10 team since 2007, marked a significant morale boost and potential turning point for the Bruins, with fans chanting Neuheisel's name in celebration.</p>

          <h2>Explaining "Freshers' Flu" and Why University Students Often Get Sick</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," a common assortment of cold viruses, widely affects university students in their first weeks due to a "mixing pot" of infections from diverse backgrounds in close quarters. Immunologists explain that late nights, poor diet, stress, and alcohol consumption during freshers' week significantly weaken the immune system, making students more susceptible to new viruses. Stress, in particular, suppresses immune responses, while lack of sleep and unhealthy eating further compromise the body's defenses. Despite the pressure to socialize, experts advise students to prioritize rest and seek medical help if symptoms persist, as the body needs time to recover from viral assaults.</p>
