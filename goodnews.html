The celebration commemorated Gayle's legacy of what her family termed "aggressive kindness," which involved relentlessly sharing homemade treats and generosity with community members. For years, Gayle delivered baked goods to workers at local businesses, becoming a beloved local figure.

          <p>Following the recent Gaza ceasefire and release of Israeli hostages, a wave of disinformation has spread across social media, fueling confusion and polarization. This article from DW's fact-checking team debunks several viral false claims, including the incorrect assertion that no female hostages survived captivity. It also clarifies that widely shared footage of celebrating Hamas fighters and a luxury car in Gaza are old and unrelated to the current events. The report highlights the use of out-of-context media to manipulate public perception of the conflict.</p>

Or was among the 20 living hostages freed on Monday as part of the new ceasefire agreement. A government video captured their emotional reunion, marking a significant moment for the nation as families are brought back together after prolonged and traumatic captivity.</p>

          <p>The IRS has confirmed that the October 15 deadline for taxpayers who filed for an extension remains in effect, despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. While many IRS operations are closed and staff are furloughed, the agency stated that the shutdown does not alter federal income tax responsibilities. Taxpayers who requested the six-month extension must submit their returns by the deadline to avoid a late-filing penalty of 5% of the unpaid tax per month. The article notes that residents of certain states affected by natural disasters may have later deadlines. (not investment advice)</p>
