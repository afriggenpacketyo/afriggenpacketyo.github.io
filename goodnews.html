          <h2>Trump's Middle East Policies Align with Israeli Interests Despite Bypassing the Country During Recent Trip</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to experts, President Trump's recent Middle East tour, while bypassing Israel, advanced policies closely aligned with Israeli interests. Trump condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, advocated for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and cautioned Iran regarding its nuclear ambitions. Despite some Israeli unease about being excluded from the tour, analysts suggest Trump's approach prioritizes American interests while maintaining strong support for Israel. Experts emphasize that Israel should seize the strategic opportunities presented by these developments rather than merely reacting to them, particularly concerning normalization with Saudi Arabia and addressing the Iranian nuclear threat.

          <p>The Mayo Clinic is utilizing its fecal waste biobank to uncover how the microbiome influences cancer patients' responses to medications, aiming to personalize medicine. The biobank, containing over 2,000 stool samples, seeks to understand why patients react differently to cancer treatments. Researchers believe the microbiome, a collection of bacteria in the body, plays a crucial role in nutrition, pathogen resistance, and immune system education. This research is part of broader efforts to understand how the gut microbiome mediates cancer treatment responses, with some experimenting with fecal transplants to colonize patients' guts with new bacteria.

          <p>As the NBA draft combine concludes, an analyst suggests the Lakers should pursue a player who has matured through four years of college, navigating the temptations of money and fame. The economic shifts in the NBA, including rookie contract limitations and NIL policies, favor players who have demonstrated resilience and emotional intelligence. While the Lakers need a big man, they could find value in a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money and a good head on his shoulders. The analyst hopes the Lakers will prioritize a grown-up player who can contribute both on and off the court. This article comes from the Los Angeles Times.</p>
