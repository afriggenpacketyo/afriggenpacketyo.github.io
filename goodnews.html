          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI model, Claude, qualifies as "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that Anthropic's AI training did not infringe on authors' copyrights because the large language models did not reproduce creative elements or identifiable expressive styles. This decision is a significant victory for AI companies amidst ongoing legal battles over copyrighted works used in developing and training LLMs. The ruling establishes legal boundaries and opportunities for the AI industry moving forward, clarifying the use of copyrighted material in AI development.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argues that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, claiming it violates Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Johnson asserts that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets falls within his powers under Article 2, which designates the president as commander in chief. A War Powers resolution introduced by Representatives Massie and Khanna, aimed at barring unauthorized U.S. military action in Iran, faces opposition from Johnson. Massie indicated he might not advance the resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, further diminishing its prospects in the House.</p>
