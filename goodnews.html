          <p>Everton's women's team will relocate to Goodison Park, the club's historic stadium, after plans to demolish the 132-year-old site were abandoned. The Friedkin Group, which acquired the club in December, conducted a feasibility study and decided to retain the stadium for the women's team. With a capacity of nearly 40,000, Goodison Park will become the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the UK. The move underscores Everton's commitment to investing in women's football and preserving Goodison Park's legacy.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the US and China, both nations claimed victory after most of President Trump's tariffs were removed. However, analysts suggest Beijing gained the upper hand by consolidating its position as a global counterweight to Washington. China entered negotiations with years of experience dealing with Trump, demonstrating a refined strategy. The article suggests that Beijing's performative power projection may prove more valuable than immediate economic gains.</p>

          <p>Economists and policymakers anticipate a resurgence of inflation as companies adapt to President Trump‚Äôs trade war, despite a slight cooling in April. The better-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is viewed as a temporary lull, with prices expected to rise in the coming months due to import taxes. The Fed is concerned that tariffs will cause a more persistent inflation problem and is prioritizing ensuring that long-term inflation expectations do not shift significantly higher. A temporary trade deal with China has reduced the odds of a severe economic shock, but economists still warn of potential inflation and growth impacts.</p>

Options include taking out a HELOC as a financial safety net, downsizing and investing the proceeds, refinancing the mortgage to take out cash, or using a reverse mortgage to create steady income. Experts advise homeowners to carefully consider the terms and potential drawbacks of each option, such as variable interest rates or potential foreclosure risks.
