          <p>A significant fire broke out in a restaurant at the former BBC Television Centre in west London, prompting a large-scale response. Around 100 firefighters and 15 engines were dispatched to the nine-story building, which now contains flats, studios, and restaurants. Residents were evacuated as a precaution, and a local rest center was established for those displaced by the blaze. While the fire caused considerable disruption and smoke, authorities have reported no casualties, and the cause of the incident is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his ascension to adulthood brings renewed focus to Japan's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the country faces a potential succession crisis. This event has reignited debates about allowing female members, like Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne to ensure the monarchy's future.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, while facing criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD has denounced the movement's "globalist uniformity," echoing historical attacks by the Nazi party, which shut down the school in 1933. Despite these political pressures, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its centennial program, which focuses on the evolution of modern materials and sustainable design. The events highlight the school's enduring legacy and its ongoing relevance in contemporary social and political discourse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay recounts the author's journey to becoming a devoted Buffalo Bills fan after previously being indifferent to sports. The transformation began when the author's Buffalonian boyfriend and his family introduced them to the team's culture, which is deeply intertwined with the city's identity. The article explores how supporting the Bills, a team known for its underdog spirit and near-misses at victory, mirrors the resilience of Buffalo itself. Ultimately, the shared experience of fandom created a powerful sense of belonging and a new understanding of what "home" can mean.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team secured a valuable point in their World Cup qualification campaign with a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work-rate and resilience in a performance that has bolstered their chances in a competitive group. This result is seen as a positive and strategic start, especially compared to previous campaigns where early losses often derailed their aspirations. The performance of key players, including Grant Hanley and the returning Aaron Hickey, has given fans reason for cautious optimism for the upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the deportation of approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians, allowing them to continue living and working in the United States. The judge criticized the administration's decision as "arbitrary and capricious," stating it would force people to return to dangerously unstable home countries. This decision provides critical relief for these communities, though it comes after some individuals have already faced deportation and family separation.</p>

          <p>A fierce competition for top artificial intelligence talent has erupted among tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft, who are offering multi-million dollar compensation packages to a small pool of elite researchers and engineers. This "AI talent war" is driven by the immense cost and strategic importance of developing advanced AI models, with companies viewing massive salaries as a necessary investment to secure a competitive edge. The trend is causing wage inflation in the sector and making it difficult for startups and traditional industries to compete for the best minds, raising concerns about talent concentration within a few dominant firms.

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, recently demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's meetings with leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties. This diplomatic channel, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates alongside traditional state-level foreign relations. While distinct from the Cold War-era promotion of a global communist movement, these interactions serve as a key part of Beijing's foreign policy strategy. The International Department has connections with over 600 political parties worldwide and has been increasingly used to expand China's diplomatic reach, including recent engagement in the Middle East.</p>
