          <h2>Toyota Aims for Significant Growth in Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 12:27:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting substantial growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as the automotive industry faces uncertainty regarding the adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to approximately 20% by 2030, though this target may change based on regulations and customer acceptance. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, stated that Toyota is committed to increasing the EV-only range of its PHEVs. This strategy aligns with potential steppingstones to all-electric vehicles for consumers hesitant to fully commit to EVs, and the company sees plug-ins as a strong powertrain option amid regulatory uncertainty and fluctuating consumer demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently serving prison sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. Trump communicated his decision to the Chrisleys' children, expressing hope that the pardon could be finalized quickly. The couple was convicted in 2022 for submitting false financial statements to obtain loans and concealing income from the IRS. Their daughter, Savannah, has been advocating for their pardon, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status and comparing their case to Trump's legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for its unusual structure, mirroring Facebook's 2012 IPO where existing shareholders are selling a larger portion of shares than the company itself. In Circle's case, existing shareholders will sell 60% of the shares, compared to the company's 40%. This decision, while unexplained by Circle, likely stems from venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The IPO aims to raise $240 million for Circle, which is profitable and has significant cash reserves, but the substantial insider sales reflect the pressure on early investors to realize gains after a multiyear drought in IPOs.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed his desire for Canada to join ReArm Europe, a major European plan aimed at bolstering defenses, to reduce reliance on the U.S. for defense. Carney noted that a significant portion of Canada's defense spending goes to the United States, which he deemed unwise. This consideration comes amid tensions with the U.S. and threats from President Donald Trump, although Carney has also indicated openness to joining a missile defense project proposed by Trump. Canada's defense minister emphasized the need to boost defense capacity in response to growing global threats, focusing on the Arctic and strengthening relationships with European allies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It's important to regularly check your medicine cabinet for expired medications and dispose of them properly to ensure safety and effectiveness. Medications can become less potent or contaminated after their expiration date, posing health risks. Pharmacists recommend storing medications in a cool, dry place, such as a kitchen cabinet, rather than a bathroom. Expired sunscreen should also be discarded due to decreased effectiveness. Safe disposal methods include using medication take-back locations or mixing medications with coffee grounds or kitty litter before throwing them away in household garbage.</p>

The updated guidance includes the impact of tariffs, such as a 30% tariff on imports from China and a 10% levy on goods from other countries. The surge in shares followed the company's fiscal first-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and provided strong revenue guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling nearly 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a software issue that can cause the rearview camera image to malfunction while in reverse. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) warned that a frozen rearview camera display could create a false representation of the vehicle's surroundings, increasing crash risk. The recall affects several Ford and Lincoln models from 2021 to 2025. The fix involves updating the vehicle's accessory protocol interface module (APIM) software, which will be available for free at dealerships or via over-the-air updates.</p>
