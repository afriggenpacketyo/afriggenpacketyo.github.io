          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication for Type 2 diabetes, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus. The highest dose of orforglipron reduced blood sugar levels by 2.2% and resulted in an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's drug. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval in 2026, intensifying the competition in the lucrative market for convenient GLP-1 treatments.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. While currently posing no immediate threat to land, forecasters anticipate it will strengthen into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves north of the Caribbean. The storm's projected path could bring it near Bermuda next week, though its exact trajectory and intensity remain somewhat uncertain as the system continues to develop over open waters.</p>

At a recent conference, commissioners from the ACC, Big 12, and Big East discussed the challenge of balancing rising revenues with increasing expenses, with some questioning the long-term sustainability of the current model. They also explored new revenue streams, including potential partnerships with private equity firms, to help offset the costs associated with the new era of collegiate athletics.</p>

          <p>After a 12-year absence, National Hockey League players are set to participate in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, a move Commissioner Gary Bettman believes will be significant for the sport. The decision to return was influenced by a new agreement with the IOC that improves commercial arrangements and player conditions, as well as strong sentiment from players who want to compete at a best-on-best international level. While the league will pause its season, Bettman stated that on balance, the global visibility and player enthusiasm make the return worthwhile.</p>

          <h2>IRS Expected to Adjust 2026 Federal Income Tax Brackets for Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:43:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service is projected to adjust federal income tax brackets for 2026 by an inflation rate of approximately 2.7%, potentially lowering taxes for many Americans. This annual adjustment is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where cost-of-living pay increases push workers into higher tax brackets without an actual increase in purchasing power. Due to recent tax legislation, the income thresholds for each tax rate will rise, meaning taxpayers will need to earn more to be subject to a higher marginal tax rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:41:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Parliament has approved significant justice reforms, most notably the elimination of the "not proven" verdict, a unique and long-standing feature of the country's legal system. Critics have long argued that this third verdict option is confusing and denies closure to victims, as it has the same legal effect as a "not guilty" acquittal. To address concerns that this change could increase wrongful convictions, the reforms will also raise the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds.</p>
