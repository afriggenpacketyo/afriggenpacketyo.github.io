          <p>At a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, President Donald Trump celebrated the narrow passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major tax and spending package. He used the event, officially the start of America's 250th anniversary celebrations, to attack political opponents and tout his administration's achievements. Trump also announced unconventional plans for the anniversary, including a "Great American State Fair" and a UFC championship fight to be held on the White House grounds. The article notes his rhetoric remained divisive, even as he unveiled a policy shift allowing some migrant farm laborers to remain in the US.</p>

          <p>Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has admitted to feeling nervous ahead of the band's farewell performance at Villa Park in their home city of Birmingham.

          <p>The Australian hearing-implant company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing device system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the technology. The launch was facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong. Unlike traditional hearing aids that amplify sound, Cochlear's implant bypasses damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. The company's chief technology officer stated that the device is most effective for users who have severe to profound hearing loss and for whom conventional hearing aids are no longer beneficial.</p>

          <p>China's government has again vowed to tackle the issues of oversupply and excessive competition within its solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting with industry leaders, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated it would comprehensively address "disorderly low-price competition" and guide companies toward higher quality. The directive follows a call from President Xi Jinping to eliminate excess industrial capacity. The article notes this is a recurring promise, as China seeks to consolidate its dominant position in the global solar market while managing internal economic pressures.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, further fueling speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His tour will cover eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, a move the state's Democratic Party chair says is aimed at showing these voters they are not forgotten. While a political advisor denies presidential ambitions, insisting the focus is on the 2026 midterms, the trip follows several other overtures by Newsom to voters in southern states, including a high-profile debate with Florida's governor.</p>

          <p>For the first time, scientists in China have successfully grown a beating heart structure composed of human cells inside a pig embryo. Researchers from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health announced that the human-cell-derived heart continued to beat unaided for 21 days. The team achieved this by reprogramming human stem cells with genes designed to prevent cell death, then implanting them into pig embryos at an early stage. This breakthrough in chimera research follows the same team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs for up to 28 days.</p>
