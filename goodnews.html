          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit from the school arguing it was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda regarding antisemitism. President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with Harvard, stating the school has acted appropriately during negotiations and appears committed to doing what is right. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that enrolling foreign students is a privilege, not a right, and that the administration is committed to restoring common sense to the student visa system. This legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where about one in four students are from outside the United States.</p>

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, up 53 percent from 2016. The phenomenon known as "seichi junrei," or "holy pilgrimage," has become popular among fans, who visit places that inspired or were the real-life settings for popular works, requiring local governments to develop systems to offer multilingual support.</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan after previously being considered a new species. Researchers used dental calculus to extract DNA from the skull after initial attempts to extract DNA from a tooth failed. The analysis revealed that the "dragon man" was not a new species but an intact Denisovan specimen. Denisovans coexisted with modern-day humans and are closely related to Neanderthals, with the skull being discovered in mysterious circumstances during bridge construction.</p>

Analysts suggest China will monitor the dispute closely, avoiding direct mediation, but may work with Asean to prevent future confrontations. The clash, which left one Cambodian soldier dead, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, an important trade gateway for China. While the risk of a wider escalation is considered low, the incident could impact China's efforts to foster closer regional ties.</p>

          <p>Dietitians are recommending chia seed pudding as a beneficial late-night snack for lowering cholesterol due to its high fiber content and low saturated fat. The soluble fiber in chia seeds can absorb cholesterol in the gut, removing it from the body. Made with almond milk, this snack contains minimal saturated fat, which is known to increase cholesterol production in the liver. The plant protein in chia seeds also contributes to heart health, making it a suitable option for those looking to manage their cholesterol levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving anomalous radio waves detected from below the ice in Antarctica. The strange signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos, but these radio waves don't seem to be neutrinos. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, which should have absorbed the radio waves. The origin of the signals remains unclear, but researchers hope larger, more sensitive detectors may solve the mystery.</p>
