        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article on Fox News suggests a biblical approach to choosing a spouse, drawing from the story of Abraham finding a wife for Isaac in Genesis 24. The article highlights three key traits to look for: finding a spouse in a good place (culturally open to God), physical attractiveness, and generosity. The article contrasts this with modern dating trends, which often involve prolonged compatibility testing and can lead to dissatisfaction. It emphasizes that love is cultivated through giving and commitment, rather than simply "falling in love," and suggests identifying a few essential traits before marriage, fostering love through continual acts of giving. </p>
