          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint as an improper political attack rather than a serious legal document. Judge Steven Merryday stated the 85-page filing was filled with "tedious and burdensome" language unsuited for a legal complaint, comparing it to a "megaphone for public relations." While the judge did not rule on the case's legal merits, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to submit a revised, more professional complaint not exceeding 40 pages.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. The final witness, an FBI agent, presented evidence showing Routh had been living at a gas station and conducting surveillance on the former president for a month. Investigators detailed Routh's internet searches for high-powered weapons and his alleged text messages seeking rocket-propelled grenades to prevent Trump from being elected. Routh, who is representing himself, plans to call three witnesses for his defense next week.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been chosen to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St. James's Park in London. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, stated he is "elated" by the commission and intends to capture the late monarch's "grandeur and dignity." The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will also feature a tribute to Prince Philip, is set to be revealed in 2026 after consultation with the Royal Family.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of major investments in the United Kingdom from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft is fueling optimism about the country's potential as an "AI superpower." The investments, totaling tens of billions of pounds, were highlighted during President Trump's state visit and are seen as a way to sprinkle "Silicon Valley stardust" on the UK's research sector. However, the enthusiasm is tempered by criticism from figures like Sir Nick Clegg, who warns that Britain risks merely "clinging on to the coattails of Uncle Sam" and exporting its best ideas.

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy has discussed his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," emphasizing that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for nearly a quarter of his life. As he promotes his new film "Steve," Murphy described playing Shelby across six television series as a "defining" gift and privilege. While he confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" film will soon be released by Netflix, he stated that the plot remains a closely guarded secret to maintain the surprise for the show's large and devoted fanbase.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles comedy show called "Pupusas and Punchlines" is providing a vital stage for Latinx and other underrepresented comedians in a competitive stand-up scene. Held in a Salvadoran restaurant, the show allows performers to connect with an audience over shared cultural experiences while enjoying a meal, a concept created by producer Justin Alexio. The event has grown from a monthly gathering to a sold-out weekly show, offering a supportive atmosphere where comics can freely joke about the immigrant experience and build their careers in an industry that often marginalizes them.</p>

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a method he has employed at the U.S. southern border. UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle responded by stating that the UK Border Force has the specific responsibility for policing borders, and while the navy can be called upon if needed, the military's primary focus remains on national defense and global security issues.</p>

The party argues the move would make policing more visible and accessible, making it easier for the public to report crimes and build confidence in law enforcement. They suggest the cost of the "police desk promise" could be covered by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles. The policy was announced at the start of the party's annual conference.</p>
