        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The high-energy atmosphere of the US Open has reignited a debate surrounding tennis etiquette, with several contentious incidents sparking discussion among players and fans. Controversies have emerged over actions like not apologizing for net cords, the use of underarm serves, and body shots, challenging traditional sportsmanship norms. While some players consider certain behaviors acceptable, others, including former champions, express frustration, highlighting a cultural divide on what constitutes proper conduct in professional tennis, particularly in the unique environment of New York.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court panel delivered a significant blow to former President Donald Trump's administration, ruling that it cannot use the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to accelerate the deportations of individuals accused of membership in a Venezuelan gang. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with immigrant rights advocates and lower courts, asserting that the rarely-used wartime statute was not intended for peacetime immigration enforcement against groups like Tren de Aragua. This decision blocks a signature administration push and is likely to escalate to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final determination.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy demonstrated robust performance in the second quarter, expanding by a stronger-than-expected 1.8% year-over-year, marking its fastest growth pace since September 2023. This notable increase, surpassing economist forecasts, was primarily fueled by strong domestic spending, particularly from households and government consumption. Although the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates and noted some clarity on global uncertainties, analysts caution that this quarter's growth might represent a "high watermark" for 2025, anticipating steady rather than spectacular growth ahead due to underlying economic concerns.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump dismissed circulating rumors about his ill health as "fake news," asserting his active engagement over the Labor Day weekend with media interviews and visits to his Virginia golf course. Speculation regarding his well-being had gained traction on social media, partly fueled by his lack of a public schedule and comments from Vice President JD Vance. Trump expressed frustration over what he described as a constant, "fake" narrative questioning his physical condition.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring schools to alert families and teachers when immigration enforcement authorities are present on campuses, a direct response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaigns. The "Safe Act," authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, aims to empower school communities with information to ensure the safety of students and their families. This legislation, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, seeks to preserve schools as secure environments for learning, particularly for the state's large immigrant student population.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a burgeoning "branding supercycle," moving beyond its reputation for manufacturing cheap goods to establishing global trust in its diverse brands. The success of consumer brands like Pop Mart's Labubu doll is now expanding into industrial sectors, including leading battery producer CATL and electric vehicle manufacturers like Xiaomi and BYD. This significant shift indicates that Chinese companies are increasingly prioritizing brand advantage and consumer trust over mere cost, signaling a profound transformation in their approach to global market competition.

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, formerly Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, has publicly challenged the government's controversial plan to restrict a civil service internship scheme exclusively to working-class students. Gray, herself from a working-class background, questioned the policy's evidence base, arguing that diverse exposure is vital for development. While the government aims to broaden the talent pool, critics, including Tory Baroness Finn, contend that the new criteria could unfairly discriminate against students from other professions, raising concerns about the fundamental principles of meritocracy and equitable access.</p>

          <p>Cardi B achieved a rapid and conclusive victory in a civil trial, as a jury found her not liable in a lawsuit filed by a security guard alleging assault. Emani Ellis claimed the rapper scratched her face and spat on her during a February 2018 incident at a doctor's office, when Cardi B's pregnancy was still private. The Grammy-winning artist testified that Ellis was recording her and that their heated argument never escalated to physical contact, a defense corroborated by a receptionist's account.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against the most severe proposed remedies in the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google, allowing the tech giant to retain its Chrome browser. The judge cited the transformative emergence of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, as a "game changer" that has fundamentally reshaped the competitive landscape of the tech industry. While Google is now mandated to share search data and prohibited from exclusive contracts, the decision acknowledges AI's role in fostering new market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court reinstated Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, effectively blocking former President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from office. The court ruled that FTC commissioners cannot be dismissed by a president without cause, reinforcing nearly a century of established legal precedent on the independence of regulatory agencies. This decision marks another significant legal setback for Trump's executive authority, though the broader dispute over the removal of commissioners is anticipated to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>
