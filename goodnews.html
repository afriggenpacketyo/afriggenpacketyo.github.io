          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a higher open on Monday, with particular attention focused on Japan after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new pro-stimulus leader. Analysts anticipate Takaichi will advocate for the Bank of Japan to maintain its accommodative monetary policy, though she would be open to a 25 basis points rate hike by January 2026. Her administration is expected to completely shift policy direction, seeking to expand investment and demand through public-private partnerships. This article notes that major regional indices, including Japan's Nikkei 225, indicated upward trends for the upcoming trading day. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lesley Stahl recounted her experience interviewing the cast of "Spinal Tap II: the End Continues" for 60 Minutes, where she encountered the actors fully in character. Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, known for their improvisational skills, maintained their band personas throughout the interaction, leading to a "confused" but entertaining interview for Stahl. Director Rob Reiner explained that both the original and sequel films are largely improvised, relying on the actors' talent to spontaneously create dialogue.

          <p>China is heavily investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-end chip production, aiming to reduce its reliance on US technology and challenge Nvidia's market dominance. Companies like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled new chips, claiming performance comparable to Nvidia's while also making designs publicly available. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged China is "nanoseconds behind" and urged the US to compete for survival in the AI race. This article notes that while China has made significant progress, it still lags in complex analytics and highly developed supply chains due to US export restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is actively encouraging its skilled professionals to return home, prompted by US President Donald Trump's decision to significantly raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000. While some Indians are already relocating due to a perceived hostile US immigration environment, experts note that large-scale reverse migration faces substantial challenges. This article highlights platforms like B2I, which assist non-resident Indians in navigating the emotional, financial, and professional hurdles of returning. It also notes a rise in Ivy League students considering India, but emphasizes that a concerted government effort is crucial to sustain this trend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced significant housing market reforms aimed at reducing costs, shortening transaction times, and halving failed property sales, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and cut up to four weeks off the typical property transaction timeline. Proposals include legally requiring sellers and agents to provide upfront information on property condition and costs, and potentially introducing binding contracts. This article notes the reforms also seek to boost professional standards across the sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mohamed Salah's limited defensive contributions are becoming a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger opponents, according to a sports analyst. While his attacking freedom has made him one of the world's most potent goalscorers, the lack of defensive cover from players behind him creates a 2v1 overload on the right flank. This tactical imbalance was exploited in a recent loss to Chelsea, leading to the winning goal. This article suggests that while Salah's scoring form is not a long-term worry, Liverpool needs to improve its defensive shape and control of games to prevent further exploitation.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers explains his unique approach to studying Chinese society and government through visual evidence, arguing that art "participates" in political debate rather than merely reflecting it. He provides an example of a Han dynasty prime minister story, widely depicted in art, illustrating a concept of jurisdictional boundaries that was well understood. Powers suggests that images, especially public ones, reveal how intergroup relations and authority were imagined by audiences. This article delves into how aristocratic art often depicts dominant figures exercising arbitrary privilege, a concept Montesquieu termed "honour."</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer observes a "magical" speculative bull market where investors appear complacent, ignoring potential risks like government shutdowns, and advises caution. He attributes the market's resilience to a "post-'Liberation Day'" rally, spurred by President Trump's reversal on tariffs, creating a "Trump put" effect. Cramer notes a new generation of buyers chasing volatile, future-oriented stocks, exemplified by companies like Palantir and Rigetti. Despite the seemingly unstoppable upward trend, he recommends taking some profits, emphasizing that even when believing in magic, it is prudent to secure gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, currently the world's largest exporter, should strategically pivot its economic focus to become the largest importer within the next five to ten years. The author suggests that Beijing's upcoming 15th five-year plan should prioritize domestic consumption over investment and exports to address existing structural imbalances. This proposed shift, from "made in China" to "consumed in China," is presented as crucial for the nation's goal of becoming a "modern socialist country" and would carry profound geopolitical and economic implications for global trade.</p>
