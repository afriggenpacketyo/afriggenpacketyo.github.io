          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India have finalized a significant free trade agreement, which is projected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually by 2040. This landmark deal, achieved after three years of intense negotiations, includes substantial tariff reductions on a wide range of goods, such as textiles, alcoholic beverages, and automobiles. Both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the pact as a "historic" blueprint for shared prosperity, emphasizing its potential to increase wages, elevate living standards, and reduce consumer prices. The agreement is also considered a strategic diplomatic success for New Delhi, securing improved market access for key Indian exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Retail Sales Increase in June, Driven by Warm Weather and Increased Fuel Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:55:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes experienced a 0.9% increase in June, primarily driven by warm weather that boosted fuel and supermarket sales, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS noted that people bought more drinks and ventured out in the sunshine, leading to higher fuel purchases. However, this modest rise followed a significant and downwardly revised 2.8% fall in May, indicating a deeper slump than previously estimated. Economists had anticipated a stronger rebound for June, making the actual increase "disappointingly small." Consequently, overall sales volumes for the April-to-June quarter suggest that the broader economy will likely experience sluggish growth during this period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>India Faces Mounting Pressure to Conclude Trade Deal with U.S. Before Tariff Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:29:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India faces intensified pressure to conclude a trade agreement with the United States ahead of an August 1 deadline, which would trigger a significant increase in U.S. tariffs on Indian products to 26%. The recent trade deal between the U.S. and Japan has added to New Delhi's urgency in these negotiations. India is keen to safeguard its sensitive agricultural sectors, mirroring its approach in the recently finalized agreement with the UK, while the U.S. seeks broader market access. Analysts suggest that strategically, Washington views India as a vital partner to counterbalance China's growing global influence, potentially shifting manufacturing supply chains to India to complement domestic production efforts.

          <h2>Robert Whittaker Set to Return to UFC After Recovering from Severe Jaw Injury</h2>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to make his return to the octagon after a nine-month recovery from a severe jaw injury, sustained during a fight that resulted in his bottom teeth caving in. The 34-year-old Australian, who underwent surgery for multiple teeth extractions and implants, humorously downplays the initial pain, emphasizing the greater discomfort of his post-operative wiring. Whittaker, currently ranked fifth in the UFC middleweight division, will face Dutch middleweight Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi. Despite the serious nature of his injury, Whittaker asserts his primary motivation is no longer regaining the title, but rather leading by example for his children and demonstrating sporting longevity at the top level.</p>

          <h2>Football Association Chief Opposes Expansion of VAR Powers Due to Game Interruptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:37:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the Football Association, has asserted that there is no necessity to expand the application of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football, citing that the current model already introduces "enough interruptions to the game." This declaration comes amidst reports that the International FA Board (Ifab), the sport's law-making body, might consider broadening VAR's powers to include incidents like corner kicks and second yellow cards. The FA, holding a seat on Ifab alongside other British associations and Fifa, has made its opposition clear. Bullingham indicated that while any proposal would be considered by the group, the FA's position is that the system is in a "good place now" and does not require further extension, aiming to preserve the flow of the game.</p>

          <p>During U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland, the United Kingdom is actively seeking to solidify its relationship with the White House and address outstanding elements of a recently agreed U.S.-UK trade deal. Although a baseline 10% tariff on British goods entering the U.S. has commenced, key aspects remain in the "commitment" phase, notably the removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, contingent on British origin verification. Additionally, thorny discussions persist over the UK's digital services tax, which Washington aims to have removed. Analysts suggest that any specific headline announcements following Trump's informal meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer could positively influence U.S.-UK relations, even if the broader deal's detailed benefits are still debated.

          <p>Wales is pioneering a UK-first initiative by introducing debit-style cards preloaded with funds to assist individuals requiring gluten-free food, such as those diagnosed with coeliac disease. This innovative scheme, set to begin later this year, offers a significant alternative to the existing prescription-based system, which patients often found embarrassing and restrictive due to limited food options. The new chip and PIN cards will be widely accepted in supermarkets, shops, and online stores, aiming to "de-medicalise the supply of gluten-free foods" and empower consumers with greater choice and dignity. While the specific monetary amount on the cards will vary and be regularly reviewed, the Welsh government anticipates the scheme will be cost-neutral for the NHS budget. This approach seeks to improve the quality of life for those with dietary needs.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley expresses feeling "refreshed and recharged" as he enters his fourth season, despite mounting pressure to elevate the team's performance following a disappointing 7-6 campaign. Riley attributes his renewed vigor to a new general manager, Chad Bowden, who has streamlined personnel matters, and the securing of the nation's No. 1 recruiting class for 2026. He views the program as having progressed from needing "big fixes" to now focusing on "finishes," indicating a more refined stage of development. While acknowledging the Trojans' past struggles, including inexplicable fourth-quarter collapses, the article highlights significant improvements in defensive talent, depth, and the coach's confidence in the unproven starting quarterback, Jayden Maiava, suggesting a path towards greater consistency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a new executive order aimed at significantly reshaping college sports, empowering federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Education to enforce new regulations on athletic scholarships and athlete compensation. The order specifically targets the lucrative Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals, which have dramatically altered athlete pay, seeking to rein in those deemed "pay-for-play." It also directs top athletic departments to maintain scholarship numbers for women's and Olympic sports, addressing anxieties about resource diversion following recent legal settlements. While legal experts question the order's immediate enforceability, it represents a clear signal of increasing presidential interest and federal intervention in college athletics, a move largely welcomed by the NCAA and major conferences hoping for legislative stability amidst ongoing litigation.</p>

This new bilateral treaty is poised to significantly boost both countries' submarine programs, projected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and deliver up to £20 billion ($27 billion) in British exports over the next quarter-century. British Defense Secretary John Healey, visiting Australia, underscored AUKUS as one of Britain's most critical defense partnerships, emphasizing its vital role in ensuring the indivisibility of security across the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions. The agreement specifically supports Australia's acquisition of Virginia-class submarines from the U.S. and its future domestic manufacturing capabilities, collectively strengthening regional and global security.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell publicly contradicted President Trump regarding the inflated cost figures for the Fed's extensive renovation project during their joint visit to the construction site. Trump asserted the costs had reached $3.1 billion, but Powell promptly corrected him, clarifying that this figure erroneously included a building completed five years prior and affirming that no further cost overruns are anticipated for the ongoing work. The interaction underscored the persistent tension between the two leaders, as Trump had previously suggested the project's expenses could be grounds for firing Powell, despite later downplaying such a move. The President reiterated his demand for the Fed to lower interest rates, highlighting his continued pressure on the central bank's independent monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>
