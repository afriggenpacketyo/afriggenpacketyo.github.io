          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race.

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are expanding their production overseas to ensure survival amidst ongoing trade tariffs, according to executives at China's largest solar industry exhibition. Despite a temporary truce in the US-China tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Companies are increasingly diversifying their production bases, with a significant portion of planned expansion focused on the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe. The industry recognizes that localizing production abroad is essential for long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy that delivers toxic drugs inside cancer cells, significantly halting the blood cancer myeloma for longer periods than current treatments. The therapy, called belantamab mafodotin, is an advanced form of chemotherapy that targets cancer with a higher dose while reducing side effects. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with existing therapies. The drug is designed to spot markings on plasma cells, delivering a lethal payload to kill the cancer from within.</p>
