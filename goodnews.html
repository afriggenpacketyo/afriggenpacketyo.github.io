The number of Chinese companies attending the event has more than doubled, leading to the creation of a de facto country pavilion for the first time. These companies are vying for a place in the European market as domestic profits plateau amid economic slowdown and intense competition.

          <p>A goods train from China has arrived near Tehran, marking the first delivery under the new China-Iran rail corridor project, which aims to reduce delivery times significantly. This ambitious route traverses several Central Asian countries and could eventually connect to Africa and Europe. The rail corridor reflects deepening ties between China and Iran, particularly as the U.S. considers intercepting Iranian oil tankers to enforce sanctions. The overland route allows Iran to continue its exports and reduces its reliance on vulnerable maritime channels, positioning Iran as a central transit hub in Eurasia.

          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government, involving alterations to materials, dimensions, or compositions to reclassify products under lower tariff codes. This practice, which predates the Trump administration, allows companies to benefit from exemptions and reduce duty liabilities. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into final products to qualify for lower duties, while others remove elements to ship them separately. Winnebago Industries, a motorhome manufacturer, plans to use tariff engineering and deferrals to mitigate tariff impacts. The optimism score of this article is 70.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 8-6 in a game marked by tension, ejections, and contentious calls. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was ejected in the third inning after arguing with umpires following a hit by pitch on Shohei Ohtani, which Roberts believed was intentional. Andy Pages had a standout performance, hitting two home runs and driving in runs. Controversy continued with more hit batters and a questionable time-out call by the home plate umpire. The optimism score of this article is 65.</p>
