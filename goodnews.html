          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that about two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo-era moon landings. The survey also found that a large majority still view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. These positive views on space exploration are generally consistent across different political and ideological lines, suggesting broad public backing for future space endeavors.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global AI landscape by releasing powerful, open-source artificial intelligence models. Unlike closed-off systems from U.S. giants like OpenAI, these free-to-use models allow developers worldwide to use, modify, and distribute the technology, fostering a more collaborative approach. The recent launch of DeepSeek's V3 and R1 models, which rival the capabilities of top Western AI, has sent shockwaves through the tech industry. This open-source movement is not only accelerating AI applications within China but also presenting a serious competitive challenge to the dominance of American proprietary AI.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:49:34 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump announced at the White House that ten more Israeli hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly." The statement comes as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. This development follows recent indirect talks mediated by Qatar and a visit to Washington by Israel's Mossad chief to discuss regional issues.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive. During intense fighting, a music box from his sister inspired him to imagine a peaceful carousel in a mountain meadow, an image that provided solace. After battling PTSD for years, Harrison decided to make his vision a reality, purchasing and restoring a broken-down carousel over 26 years and carving new animals for it. Now, the "Carousel of Happiness" operates as a nonprofit in Nederland, Colorado, delighting over a million visitors and providing its creator with daily medicine for his own trauma.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation primarily governs the $250 billion stablecoin market, establishing consumer protections and clear rules for banks and other institutions to issue their own stablecoins pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Hailing it as a potential "revolution in financial technology," Trump said the act would strengthen the dollar and provide a 21st-century upgrade to the financial system. The law is seen as a major step in bringing digital currencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system needs to rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. Shin Hyun-Song of the BIS warned that the rise of stablecoins and other digital assets poses significant challenges to existing infrastructures for payment, clearing, and settlement. He noted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of these instruments could complicate anti-money-laundering efforts and other regulatory tasks. This call for new standards comes amid a surge in the crypto market, driven partly by the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced that the company will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Stocks often experience a rally upon being added to a major index, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase the stock to rebalance their holdings. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's inclusion reflects the growing influence of the technology sector within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. In a memo, Dr. Sean Barbabella described the condition as "benign and common," especially in people over 70, and confirmed that tests found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and wearing compression stockings, with the doctor declaring the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The Silicon Valley-backed "California Forever" project, which aims to build a new city in Solano County, has unveiled plans for a large-scale manufacturing hub within its development. The proposed 2,100-acre "Solano Foundry" would be designed to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other advanced industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. Project CEO Jan Sramek stated the plan is to restore the "designed in California, made in California" model by co-locating R&D and production. The ambitious project continues to face skepticism from some local residents and community groups.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has changed its support protocols to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical assistance for its U.S. Department of Defense cloud clients. The move follows a ProPublica report that raised national security concerns about the practice, which involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising the work of more technically proficient engineers in China. In a statement, Microsoft's chief communications officer confirmed the change, affirming the company's commitment to providing secure services to the U.S. government. The Pentagon has also stated it will review its systems for similar security vulnerabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK report that this summer is shaping up to be a "good year for wasps," with populations seemingly thriving. The increase is likely due to the very warm and dry spring, which created ideal breeding conditions for the insects. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers that help maintain balance in gardens and wild landscapes. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid swatting at the insects and can distract them by leaving a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's health service will extend its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, offering them protection against the common and highly infectious respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection will be available for infants born too early to have benefited from the maternal vaccine administered during pregnancy. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and officials state the new program will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness. The move follows a warning from the Chief Medical Officer about a worrying decline in the uptake of general childhood immunizations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:50:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research, published in Science Immunology, found that in people with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a molecule produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The discovery opens the door to developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway, potentially improving outcomes for many sufferers.</p>
