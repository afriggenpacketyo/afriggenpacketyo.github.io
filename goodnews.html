          <p>This article details the rescue of abused and indoctrinated children from the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult following the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack. Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, recounts the initial challenges of caring for the 53 children, who were malnourished, emotionally detached, and hostile. Over time, the children began to heal through play, nourishment, and the establishment of trust with the center's staff. The article emphasizes the importance of re-establishing the parent-child relationship and providing a safe environment for the children to regain their sense of self and integrate back into society.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving donated sneakers a second life by either reselling them in developing countries or crushing them for use in flooring and other products. The company collects used shoes from drop-off locations across the United States and sorts them for reuse or recycling. Reusable shoes are shipped to countries like Haiti and Honduras, where they are resold by local businesses, while unusable shoes are transformed into new materials. This initiative reduces waste and creates economic opportunities in developing nations.</p>

          <p>A fire erupted in the hourly parking garage at Jacksonville International Airport, destroying approximately 50 vehicles and causing significant disruption for travelers. The fire's cause is believed to have originated in one vehicle and quickly spread to others, leading to a partial collapse of the garage roof. While no casualties are expected, many travelers are uncertain about the fate of their vehicles and how they will get home. The Jacksonville Aviation Authority is providing support and information to those affected, and a dedicated webpage has been launched for people to submit their information.</p>
