          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin, President Trump shared his perspective in an exclusive interview, stating he believes the Russian leader genuinely wants to see an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump rated the meeting a "10" for rapport and said that while a final deal wasn't reached, significant progress was made. He also reiterated his advice for Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is to "make a deal." This interview provides direct insight into the U.S. President's interpretation of the summit and his intended next steps in the diplomatic process.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the Justice Department has agreed to scale back its federal takeover of the city's police force. A federal judge expressed skepticism about the administration's authority, leading to an agreement where Police Chief Pamela Smith retains command. The deal also involves rewriting a controversial directive that had ended D.C.'s "sanctuary city" policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, with legal arguments on that issue set to continue in court next week.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main house on the property. This development comes a year after the city passed pioneering legislation to allow such sales, aiming to create a new form of affordable homeownership. Officials hope this "starter home" model will be adopted by other cities to help address the state's severe housing crisis, as ADUs already account for a significant portion of new housing growth across California.</p>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This challenges the long-held belief that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that pollution sources are diverse, including agriculture and diesel exhaust, and that public health efforts might be better focused on improving indoor air quality with filters rather than solely on dust control projects.</p>

          <h2>Indian Clinical Trials Suggest Mangoes May Not Adversely Affect Blood Sugar in Diabetics</h2>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes must strictly avoid mangoes. The studies found that consuming certain varieties of mango in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, resulted in similar or even lower glycemic responses. In one trial, participants with type 2 diabetes who ate mango for breakfast saw improvements in key metabolic health markers, suggesting the fruit can be part of a controlled diet under clinical supervision.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, depicts an iconic image of the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, but with a notable twist: he is wearing a Dodgers jersey instead of his Lakers uniform. The artwork is part of a larger mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship. The artist and the restaurant owner who commissioned it aimed to honor Bryant's "Mamba mentality" while staying on theme, a creative choice that has generated both praise from fans of both teams and playful criticism from others online.</p>

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with standalone stores set to return to the UK High Street and its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was bought by online retailer Asos, but it now aims to recapture its former glory by appealing to both nostalgic millennial shoppers and a new Gen-Z audience. Industry experts note that while nostalgia is powerful, the brand faces challenges in a competitive market and must reclaim its "cool" factor to succeed.</p>
