          <p>Billionaire investor Reid Hoffman has publicly defended the AI startup Anthropic, calling it one of the "good guys" in the industry. This statement came in response to criticism from David Sacks, who serves as President Trump's AI and crypto czar and had accused Anthropic of fear-mongering to achieve regulatory capture. The exchange between the two prominent tech figures, both part of the original "PayPal mafia," highlights the increasing politicization of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning safety, ethics, and governmental regulation.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician who helped expose the Flint water crisis, has launched a new program called "Rx Kids" to fight child poverty in the city. The initiative, a first of its kind in the U.S., provides no-strings-attached cash payments to every expectant mother in Flint, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the baby's first year. Funded primarily by private donors, the program aims to directly address the health issues caused by poverty and is gaining bipartisan support for its efficiency.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates reaching more affordable levels, this article outlines several critical mistakes for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. It cautions against waiting for rates to drop even further, as market movements are not linear and can reverse unexpectedly. The piece also advises borrowers to explore all savings avenues, such as paying for mortgage points to lower a rate or considering adjustable-rate mortgages for initial savings. It emphasizes that even a small rate reduction can lead to significant long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The end of the calendar year is a popular time for investors to perform Roth IRA conversions, a strategy that involves moving funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and paying income tax upfront. Financial experts note that waiting until the fourth quarter allows for a more accurate assessment of one's annual income, which is crucial for managing the tax implications of the conversion. While converting earlier in the year could start tax-free growth sooner, it carries the risk of unforeseen income pushing the investor into a higher tax bracket.</p>

The article outlines various scenarios, demonstrating how different deposit amounts and term lengths, such as 6-month or 18-month CDs, can still provide profitable, guaranteed returns in a declining rate environment.
