          <h2>UK Schools to Introduce New Anti-Misogyny and Online Safety Curriculum in Sex Education</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:41:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England mandates the teaching of anti-misogyny, deepfake awareness, and healthy consent in sex education classes, with full legal force by September 2026. Schools will educate pupils on identifying positive male role models and proactively involve parents in curriculum discussions. While specific age limits are removed, the guidance outlines content for primary and secondary levels, encompassing topics like incel norms, AI-generated sexual imagery, and sexual ethics beyond basic consent. Additionally, the curriculum will address suicide prevention, a crucial inclusion welcomed by advocacy groups. This updated approach aims to better equip young people for contemporary challenges.</p>

          <p>Bronny James delivered one of his strongest NBA Summer League performances, scoring 17 points with five rebounds and five assists in 24 minutes for the Lakers. Despite his impressive play and the attendance of numerous sports dignitaries, the Clippers secured a 67-58 victory. James expressed increased confidence, while Lakers assistant coach Lindsey Harding praised his energy and offensive reads and defensive efforts. The article highlights James's growing presence on the court and the excitement he continues to generate, even as the Lakers showed signs of fatigue.</p>

          <p>Ireland wing Mack Hansen's fitness for the British and Irish Lions' first Test against Australia remains ambiguous, despite initial assurances from assistant coach John Dalziel. Another assistant, Richard Wigglesworth, later confirmed Hansen sustained a foot injury against the AUNZ Invitational team and did not fully participate in Tuesday's training. This situation creates confusion, as Wigglesworth stated anyone not training fully is a "doubt" for Saturday, yet also suggested the 23-man squad had already been settled. With injured full-back Blair Kinghorn also a concern, the team's final lineup decisions for the crucial match are highly anticipated.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing grants of up to £3,750 to reduce the cost of eligible new electric cars, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles. Funded by a £650 million scheme over three years, these discounts will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with larger reductions for more environmentally friendly models. While the move is welcomed by carmakers like Vauxhall, industry leaders and drivers emphasize the critical need for more public charging points to support wider EV adoption, as current infrastructure lags significantly behind the government's 2030 target of 300,000 points.</p>

          <p>The EU's chief for Asia-Pacific affairs, Niclas Kvarnström, is reportedly set to depart his role following an upcoming China summit, a move described as "quite sudden" by insiders. Kvarnström, a respected and influential figure fluent in Chinese, has served in the top Asia job in Brussels for two years, previously heading the Asia-Pacific department of the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He played a key role in organizing the EU's first Indo-Pacific summit and his exit is expected to leave a significant void in the EU's China policymaking apparatus, despite his relatively short tenure.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has dramatically improved his putting game, transforming from one of the worst to a top 15 putter within 12 months, thanks to coach Phil Kenyon. This significant turnaround, aided by a crucial switch from a blade to a mallet putter and enhanced green reading, has propelled him to a remarkable season. His achievements include securing a second Masters title and an Olympic gold medal at the Paris Games. Scheffler's consistent performance, with three victories in his last ten events and top-ten finishes in the rest, solidifies his position as the world's dominant player ahead of The Open Championship.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 5.2% in the second quarter, keeping the country on track to meet its 5% full-year target. However, this growth marks a slowdown from the previous quarter, with retail sales growth slowing and real estate investment deepening its slump, signaling underlying fragility. The GDP deflator's sharp decline fuels deflation fears, prompting calls for significant fiscal stimulus and deeper structural reforms in areas like the pension system and financial sector. Despite largely resilient exports driven by price discounting, economists warn this erodes terms of trade and intensifies disinflationary pressures, urging policymakers to boost income to sustain consumer spending.

          <p>A US appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans, which would have allowed their deportation and revoked work permits. The court's one-week administrative stay follows a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy group CASA, challenging the termination. This decision provides a brief but critical reprieve for Afghans who fled their country after the Taliban's 2021 takeover, many of whom previously aided US forces. Critics argue that Afghanistan remains unsafe and ending TPS betrays a promise, while the administration claims conditions have improved sufficiently for their return.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with EVs comprising over 93% of new car sales in 2025, transforming its urban landscapes. This success is attributed to a steady stream of comprehensive government incentives, including VAT exemptions, reduced road and parking taxes, and access to bus lanes, alongside heavy investment in public charging infrastructure. The country's lack of an automaker lobby has also facilitated rapid EV uptake. The transition has resulted in notably cleaner air and quieter cities, demonstrating a highly successful and swift shift away from internal combustion engine cars.</p>

This ambitious initiative aims to showcase sustainable urban development by primarily utilizing cross-laminated timber for buildings' cores, floors, and walls, significantly reducing carbon emissions from construction. Leveraging Sweden's extensive forests and cultural connection to wood, the project will interweave new wooden homes, offices, and schools with converted older structures. The first residential phase is expected by late 2025, with plans for 2,000 more apartments by 2027, highlighting wood's aesthetic appeal and faster construction times.</p>

          <p>Groundbreaking research from Tel Aviv University suggests animals react to sounds made by plants, hinting at a previously unknown ecosystem. In the first such evidence, scientists observed female moths avoiding distressed tomato plants that emitted specific sounds, indicating unhealthiness. These plant sounds, outside human hearing, are perceivable by many insects, bats, and some mammals. Researchers are now exploring whether other species make decisions based on plant sounds and if plants communicate through sound, potentially influencing behaviors like water conservation in drought conditions. This discovery opens a "vast, unexplored field" in interspecies communication and coevolution.</p>
