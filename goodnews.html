        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence will allocate over ¬£1 billion to advance battlefield technology, including a new Digital Targeting Web that connects soldiers with satellite, aircraft, and drone data for faster threat targeting. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that this investment, made possible by increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, reflects lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, where AI and software are used to identify and engage Russian targets. A new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command will also oversee military cyber operations and electronic warfare, responding to rising cyber-attacks, with over 90,000 attacks faced by the UK military in the past two years. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte urges allies to increase defence spending beyond 3.5% of GDP.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% increase in revenue to $44.1 billion for its most recent quarter, driven by strong demand for its AI chips, despite U.S. government restrictions on sales to China. The company projects revenue in the current quarter to rise 50% to $45 billion, fueled by expanding sales of its newest A.I. chip, Blackwell, and its efforts to sell more chips to governments. CEO Jensen Huang criticized the U.S. restrictions, stating that they strengthen Chinese chipmakers and weaken America‚Äôs position, with the company anticipating an $8 billion loss due to these restrictions. Nvidia is also expanding its customer base by adding buyers across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including a major deal with the United Arab Emirates to build an A.I. data center.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly developing a rapid-response space defense system to intercept and redirect suspicious spacecraft approaching its Tiangong space station, according to scientist Sun Zhibin. The system would involve deploying a small robotic thruster to latch onto an approaching object and push it to a safer distance. This development comes after China reported to the United Nations that its space station had to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid potential collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites in 2021.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, which includes AI chips. The company expects approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, despite an estimated $8 billion loss due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang stated that the Chinese market for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry" due to the H20 export ban. Despite political tensions, Nvidia's growth is fueled by strong demand for its AI chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, with large cloud providers making up a significant portion of data center revenue.</p>
