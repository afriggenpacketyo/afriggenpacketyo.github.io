          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, reversing course after completing only 65 miles of the proposed barrier. Governor Greg Abbott's office cited President Trump's efforts to secure the border as the reason for the adjustment. The new budget allocates $3.4 billion for border security, directing funds to the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard instead of new wall projects. The halt in funding reflects a shift in priorities and a reassessment of the need for the wall amid declining migrant crossings. The article indicates a change in strategy and a possible de-escalation of border-related tensions.</p>

          <p>Rancho Palos Verdes, California, will restart a program to trap and relocate peafowl in an effort to reduce the growing peacock population by about 30%. The city has received complaints about the birds' noise and damage to property. The peacock population is the highest it's been since 2014, with 216 birds across six neighborhoods. Trapped peafowl will be sent to screened homes off the peninsula, ensuring they are not euthanized or treated inhumanely. The city aims to manage the population at levels identified in 2000 and educate the public on how to coexist with the birds.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on the sidelines of a G7 summit, aiming to reset relations after nearly two years of dispute.

The leaders reaffirmed the importance of Canada-India ties, based upon mutual respect, the rule of law, and a commitment to the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill sets requirements for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the bill, accusing Republicans of "rubberstamping Trump's crypto corruption". The GENIUS Act now heads to the House, which has its own version of a stablecoin bill.

          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming mayoral primary election, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and vote tabulation continues in rounds. The city's election board expects to provide preliminary totals for voters' first-choice votes on June 24 after polls close, and then run the ranked-choice tabulation on July 1. Ranked-choice voting has led to unusual alliances between candidates. The article explains the process of ranked-choice voting and its impact on the election.</p>
