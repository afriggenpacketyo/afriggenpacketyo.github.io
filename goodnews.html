          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in the Tokyo assembly election, winning only 22 seats, a result seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race. Tomin First no Kai, established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, secured the most seats with 32, reflecting the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito party obtained 17 and 19 seats, respectively, while Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party, gained three seats. Voter turnout increased to 47.59 percent, highlighting heightened public engagement in the political process. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland is considering establishing a clinic to offer ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, potentially as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not officially licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors, offering a new option for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments. There are also concerns about the potential for misuse and serious health problems, including fatalities, which have been linked to recreational ketamine use. </p>

          <p>Researchers studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, were surprised to find that most of the monkeys survived Hurricane Maria in 2017. The island lost two-thirds of its vegetation, but the monkeys adapted, possibly by eating seaweed and algae deposited on the beach. The research team also managed to save decades of biological data and journals by moving their offices to a sturdier location and maintaining the freezers with generators. The study of these monkeys, who share 94% of their DNA with humans, continues to provide valuable insights into stress, longevity, and overall health. </p>

Sloths have survived for over 60 million years by conserving energy through their slow movements and low-energy diet of toxic leaves. Cooke highlights the challenges sloths face due to human encroachment, particularly electrocution from power lines, and efforts to rehabilitate injured and orphaned sloths. The report also touches on a population study revealing potential climate change-related threats to sloth health, emphasizing the importance of understanding and protecting these unique creatures. </p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report highlights the issue of Social Security overpayments, where beneficiaries may unexpectedly owe significant amounts of money, even if the error wasn't their fault. To prevent overpayments, it's recommended to regularly check your earnings history on the Social Security Administration's website. If receiving disability benefits, be cautious when returning to work and accurately report any income. For Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, be aware of strict asset limits and reporting requirements. It is crucial to promptly report any mistakes to the agency and keep detailed records of all communications. </p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans to Lower Energy Costs for Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 17:33:29 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government plans to lower energy costs for businesses as part of a 10-year industrial strategy, potentially cutting energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 firms. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will exempt manufacturers from green levies on bills, while energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also aims to speed up energy grid connections for new factories and projects. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describes the plan as a "turning point for Britain's economy," supporting key industries and creating over one million new jobs. </p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan, which may slash energy bills by up to 25% for more than 7,000 UK businesses, is set to be unveiled on Monday alongside other measures hoped to boost growth. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for more than 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from levies on bills including the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market. About 500 of the most energy-intensive firms, including the steel industry, chemicals and glassmaking, will also have their network charges cut. (not investment advice)</p>
