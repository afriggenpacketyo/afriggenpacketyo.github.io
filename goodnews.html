          <p>An excerpt from Sam Tanenhaus's new biography, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," explores the early life and family background of the influential conservative figure. The text details the story of his parents, particularly his father's ventures in the oil industry in Mexico and Venezuela, which led to both financial ruin and immense wealth. This upbringing shaped the family's deep Catholic faith and resilient worldview, culminating in their settlement at a large estate in Sharon, Connecticut, where William F. Buckley Jr. was born into a sprawling and dynamic household.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus posits that William F. Buckley Jr., founder of the National Review, was the architect of the modern conservative movement in America. The article explores how his intellectualism and media presence on shows like "Firing Line" created a political path that led from Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump. While praised for his civility and intellect, Buckley's legacy is complicated by his early opposition to civil rights legislation. The analysis suggests that while their styles differ, Trump's anti-establishment politics echo the cultural critiques Buckley pioneered decades ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a major rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. The original plans, aimed at saving ¬£5 billion, faced criticism for potentially harming disabled and vulnerable people by making it harder to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Following the backlash, the government reversed course, limiting cuts to new claimants and agreeing to a review of the Pip assessment process. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the initial rollout was mishandled but stated the government is now in a "better position" to pass the necessary reforms.</p>

Corenswet, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, emphasizes the character's loneliness and desire to be part of humanity despite his alien origins.

          <p>British sports car maker Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its historic factory in Hethel, Norfolk. The meeting was prompted by concerns that Lotus's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production of its Emira sports car to the United States to avoid tariffs, a move that would have jeopardized 1,300 jobs. Lotus had paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to U.S. tariffs, but the company insists the UK remains the "heart of the Lotus brand." The government reiterated its commitment to supporting the UK's automotive sector.</p>

          <p>Forrest Galante, a wildlife biologist and "Shark Week" host, advises that while sharks should be respected, beachgoers can minimize risks by being educated about their behavior. He recommends avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk, as well as in "marine-rich environments" like river mouths where sharks naturally hunt for fish. Galante also suggests not wearing shiny jewelry, which can mimic the flash of bait fish, and notes that even the sound of a crunching can could attract a shark's attention. He emphasizes that sharks do not intentionally prey on humans and that a few minutes of research can substantially reduce the likelihood of a negative encounter.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a new strategy to combat obesity by partnering with major food retailers and manufacturers in England. Rather than imposing strict rules, the plan encourages businesses to voluntarily make healthy food more appealing and accessible through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. Health Secretary Wes Streeting framed the policy as a collaborative effort to help consumers, noting that a small daily reduction in calorie intake could significantly impact public health. The initiative aims to relieve pressure on the NHS, as reports show obesity-related illnesses cost the service ¬£11 billion annually.</p>

          <p>This article by a psychologist suggests that many people may be unhappy in their relationships without realizing it, often due to normalizing unhealthy dynamics. To assess one's situation, the author proposes four questions: Do you feel like a team during conflict? Can you be your authentic self? Is your partner curious about your inner world? Do they take accountability for mistakes? Answering "no" to these questions may indicate underlying issues, such as a lack of emotional intimacy, security, and mutual respect. The article advises that healthy partnerships require shared strategies for conflict, room for authenticity, and a commitment to understanding one another.</p>

          <p>A new analysis challenges the narrative of a "sex recession," arguing that Generation Z is spearheading a profound sexual revolution by redefining sex, gender, and relationships. While statistics show they are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are also the most progressive and diverse generation, with many rejecting traditional, heteronormative definitions of virginity and sex. The article posits that Gen Z's political consciousness, shaped by post-Roe realities and online activism, has led them to infuse sexuality with political meaning.

Despite economic uncertainty, the report notes that retirement savings behaviors have shown persistent progress, partly due to plan design features like automatic enrollment.

Also mentioned are the 2017 Chrysler 200 for transmission problems, certain BMW 3 Series models for engine issues, and early 2000s Toyota Tundras for transmission cooler failures.
