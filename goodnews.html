          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt in parts of Georgia and North Carolina. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, with the USGS receiving over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness for residents in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, which experiences occasional tremors. The article notes that seismic waves travel more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. due to the region's geology.</p>
