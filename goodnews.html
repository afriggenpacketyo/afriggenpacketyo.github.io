          <p>This CNBC article analyzes the significantly different price-to-earnings ratios of CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, two cybersecurity companies.  While CrowdStrike's higher P/E reflects investor confidence in its faster growth and subscription model, Palo Alto Networks' lower P/E is attributed to its more diverse hardware and software offerings.  Both are considered strong long-term investments within the cybersecurity sector, which is deemed mission-critical and attractive for investors.
