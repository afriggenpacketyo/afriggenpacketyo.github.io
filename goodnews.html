          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed the launch of a new political party aimed at providing an alternative to both Labour and Reform. Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, is co-founding the yet-unnamed party to campaign for a "mass redistribution of wealth" and address issues like child poverty and corporate profits. The initiative is being positioned as a grassroots, community-led movement, with an inaugural conference planned for the autumn to establish its policies.</p>

The Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program, developed with the experts behind the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, aims to provide an expedited process for resolving claims fairly and promptly.</p>

          <p>Three British citizens convicted of smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali, Indonesia, have avoided the death penalty and will instead serve a 12-month sentence. The trio, Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float, were arrested in February after the drugs were discovered hidden in packets of Angel Delight dessert mix. Under Indonesia's strict drug laws, they could have faced execution. With time already served, they could be released by early 2026, a lenient outcome in a country known for its severe punishments for drug offenses.</p>
