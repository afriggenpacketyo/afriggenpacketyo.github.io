          <p>Former President Trump announced a proposal to make Social Security benefits tax-free for the vast majority of senior citizens, timed with the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act. In a presidential proclamation, he framed the plan as the largest tax break for seniors in American history and a key part of his administration's efforts to strengthen the program. The administration also pushed back against Democratic criticism by highlighting achievements such as reduced customer service wait times and cleared disability claim backlogs. The proposal is positioned as a core commitment to protecting the financial stability of the nearly 72 million Americans who rely on the program. (not investment advice)</p>

The superstar also became emotional while recounting the decade-long process of reacquiring the master recordings of her first six albums, a moment she described as life-changing.

          <p>A man wanted in the 2008 murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy Juan Abel Escalante has been extradited from Mexico to face charges in the United States.

He is accused of being a member of the Avenues gang involved in the killing, where Deputy Escalante was shot while preparing to leave for work. Sheriff Robert Luna stated that justice has been a long time coming, as Salazar is set to be charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy.</p>

The new leadership intends to nearly double the studio's annual movie output, focusing on major franchises like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Transformers," while also investing in original filmmaker-driven projects. Ellison emphasized a goal of moving the company away from political divisions to create entertainment for a broad audience. This new strategy signals a major shift for Paramount, aiming to restore its status as a top destination for Hollywood talent and scale up its content creation for theatrical release.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered that the assets of Infowars and its parent company be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, a major step toward paying the Sandy Hook families who won a $1.3 billion defamation judgment against Alex Jones. This ruling allows for the liquidation of Infowars' property, including its brand name, to finally provide accountability for Jones's false conspiracies about the 2012 school shooting. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction with the decision, which moves the collection process out of federal bankruptcy court and could soon result in the first payouts to the victims who have been harassed for years.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that medication for ADHD offers benefits beyond managing daily symptoms. The research, which followed over 148,000 people in Sweden, found that taking ADHD medication was linked to significant reductions in the first-time instances of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. Researchers believe these positive outcomes may be due to the medication's effect on reducing impulsivity and improving concentration. These findings provide stronger evidence for the wider, long-term benefits of drug treatment and could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a strategic move to maintain their competitive edge, South Korean shipbuilding giants are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines. This shift is driven by a need to overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and to capitalize on lower operational costs in the region. The expansion is also seen as a response to U.S. trade policies that have placed curbs on China's shipbuilding industry, creating an opportunity for competitors. For example, HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services, the parent company of the digital payment network Zelle, alleging it failed to implement adequate security measures. The suit claims that these shortcomings made the platform a prime target for scammers, resulting in over $1 billion being stolen from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit accuses the company of knowing about the network's susceptibility to fraud from the beginning but failing to enforce meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks. The legal action seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers and a court order to mandate stronger safeguards.</p>

          <p>Despite a heartbreaking late collapse and penalty shootout loss to Paris St-Germain in the Super Cup, Tottenham Hotspur showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For most of the match, Spurs effectively executed a pragmatic and disciplined 3-5-2 formation, taking a 2-0 lead through well-worked set-pieces. While the team's inability to close out the game highlighted areas for improvement, the performance indicated a clear tactical shift away from the high-risk style of the previous era. The game suggests Frank is building a more resilient and strategically flexible team, offering a basis for optimism for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>As public trust shifts from traditional media to online influencers, a new class of "evidence-based creators" is emerging to combat misinformation and provide factual, nuanced content on social platforms. This article argues that while these journalists and specialists are vital, they are at a disadvantage in an attention economy that rewards virality over veracity. To support this growing ecosystem, the author proposes innovations like an independent certification system to signal credibility to audiences and a collaborative framework for creators to share resources like legal protection and marketing tools. This could help build a sustainable new model for digital journalism.</p>

          <p>With a high-stakes meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin scheduled to take place in Alaska, this article revisits the pivotal history of the territory's sale from Russia to the United States in 1867. For a price of $7.2 million, the U.S. acquired the vast expanse of land in a deal that was, at the time, famously derided as "Seward's Folly." The piece explores the motivations behind Russia's decision to sell and the strategic thinking that led the U.S. to purchase it. This historical context provides a unique backdrop to the modern diplomatic discussions set to occur on land that once belonged to Russia.</p>

          <p>Newly installed temporary barriers successfully prevented widespread damage in Juneau, Alaska, after a glacial outburst from the nearby Mendenhall Glacier triggered record-level flooding. The Mendenhall River crested at unprecedented heights, but the 10,000 "Hesco" barriers, essentially giant reinforced sandbags, largely held back the water and protected hundreds of homes. While the immediate crisis was averted, the event highlights a growing threat, as scientists attribute the intensifying annual floods to climate change. Alaska has been warming at twice the rate of the rest of the U.S., causing its glaciers to melt at an accelerated pace.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen a meteoric rise in value, now ranked as the second most valuable franchise in the NFL at $10.43 billion, trailing only the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at less than $1 billion. According to a new Sportico ranking, the franchise's soaring valuation is a direct result of its return to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium by owner Stan Kroenke. This financial success story solidifies the Rams' position as a powerhouse in the league and a premier Los Angeles sports entity. (not investment advice)</p>
