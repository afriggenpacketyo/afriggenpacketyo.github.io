          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Dan secured 55% of the vote, emphasizing the need for unity and change in Romania, particularly regarding corruption and support for Ukraine. Simion, who had significant support in the diaspora, attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv, initially claiming victory before conceding. The election followed months of political turbulence, including the annulment of a previous vote due to claims of Russian interference, which Russia has denied.</p>

          <p>China has announced the acceleration of work on the Mohmand Hydropower Project in Pakistan, a "flagship" dam project, following India's threats to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty. The China Energy Engineering Corporation has been working on the project since 2019, and it is now slated for completion next year. India's announcement to suspend the treaty, made in response to a militant attack in Kashmir, has raised concerns about water security in Pakistan, which relies heavily on the Indus river system for agriculture. This move underscores the strategic importance of water resources in the region.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is launching an initiative to identify more undiagnosed patients affected by the contaminated blood scandal, which impacted over 30,000 people in the UK. General practitioners will offer hepatitis C testing to patients who received blood transfusions before 1996, as thousands may have been exposed to the virus. The BBC revealed the scale of undiagnosed cases, highlighting individuals with life-threatening liver damage caused by the virus. Modern anti-viral drugs can now treat hepatitis C, but undetected cases can lead to serious liver damage.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China's yuan has the potential to rival a weakening US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan already works well in cross-border purchase settlements. However, to compete with the dollar, China must deepen its financial markets, improve access to yuan-denominated assets for foreigners, and create new yuan-backed asset classes. Convertibility remains a concern among investors outside the mainland. (not investment advice)</p>
