          <h2>Singapore's July Inflation Rate Drops to 0.6%, Lowest Since January 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate for July eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest point since January 2021 and falling below June's 0.8%. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily driven by decreases in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs, with private transport prices rising. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates continued moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes, while domestically, slower wage growth should also contribute to moderation. This economic trend aligns with the MAS's projections for core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024, as the trade-dependent nation faces a global trade environment "downshift." The central bank has already eased monetary policy twice this year to cope with weaker growth, and the article highlights the country's economic path towards slower growth and inflation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:14:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the "Great Resignation" of the pandemic era, labor markets in the U.S. and U.K. are now experiencing a "Great Stay," characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze from employers. This shift is attributed to economic insecurity, with workers staying put in stable positions, particularly in sectors like IT, and firms delaying hiring due to uncertainty about the future rather than a desire to reduce headcount. Despite slowing hiring momentum, as evidenced by slower U.S. nonfarm payroll growth and higher unemployment, initial jobless claims remain near historical lows. The U.K. is also observing a similar trend with falling job vacancies, as businesses await more economic confidence to drive recruitment and foster growth, as detailed in the article.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney has offered advice to Arsenal teenager Max Dowman, who recently made his Premier League debut at 15 years and 234 days old, becoming the club's second-youngest player. Rooney, who debuted at a similarly young age, emphasized the importance of remaining grounded and listening to close family and friends amidst growing fame. He praised Dowman's impressive debut, which included winning a late penalty, and highlighted the surreal experience of joining a first-team dressing room with childhood heroes. The article concludes with Rooney's heartfelt counsel to enjoy the journey, as a career in professional football passes quickly.</p>

          <p>Shares in China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group surged to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private in a deal valued at approximately $7 billion. The Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This strategic move aligns with China's efforts to consolidate its automotive sector and enhance competitiveness, following a State Council statement earlier this year. Despite a 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models, particularly the VOYAH series, climbed significantly, as reported in the article.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled the tenth test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket after encountering an issue with ground systems during the pre-launch fueling process. This delay follows three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures, underscoring the challenges in developing the massive launcher designed for Mars missions and NASA's Artemis moon landings. The planned flight aimed to test numerous upgrades, including an intentional engine disablement for landing data and in-space engine restarts, with the booster intended for a Gulf splashdown and Starship for the Indian Ocean. The article notes that achieving the required reliability for NASA's 2027 moon landing goal, which needs 10-20 successful refueling flights, remains a significant hurdle.</p>
