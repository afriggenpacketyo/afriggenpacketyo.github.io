          <p>London-based AI voice startup ElevenLabs has announced its intention to be ready for an initial public offering within the next five years. The company, recently valued at $3.3 billion, is planning significant global expansion, targeting new hubs in Europe, Asia, and South America to scale its operations. CEO Mati Staniszewski noted that while a listing location has not been decided, London is a possibility if the UK market environment for tech firms improves. This strategic move follows a recent $180 million funding round and reflects the company's ambition to become a long-lasting public entity in the rapidly growing AI industry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke makes the case that Kershaw is the greatest pitcher in the history of the Dodgers franchise, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting it with Koufax's brilliant but shorter five-year peak. The article highlights that Kershaw has outlasted Koufax in nearly every significant pitching category, including innings pitched and total strikeouts. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the piece emphasizes that his sustained excellence and cultural impact on the team solidify his status as the franchise's best.</p>

Despite Kershaw giving up four runs, the Dodgers staged a three-run rally in the ninth inning, capped by a Freddie Freeman RBI single, to secure a 5-4 victory.

In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The executive order, issued in January, had declared the border situation an 'invasion.' The judge's decision has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal, in a ruling hailed by the ACLU as critically important for protecting those fleeing danger.</p>
