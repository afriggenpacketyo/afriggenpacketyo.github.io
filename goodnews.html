          <h2>Trump Calls on Fed to Lower Rates After Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 09:55:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a better-than-expected jobs report for April, President Donald Trump renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Trump argued that there is no inflation and the Fed should lower its rate to spur growth. This marks a continuation of Trump's efforts to influence the central bank's decision-making, although he has recently scaled back his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's message contrasts with his response to news of the U.S. economy contracting, for which he blamed former President Joe Biden.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal challenge to reinstate automatic police protection for his family when visiting the United Kingdom. The judge ruled that Harry's security situation will remain as is, with state-funded police protection provided on a case-by-case basis. Harry's legal team argued that his security risk is high, citing threats from al-Qaeda, and that private bodyguards are insufficient. Harry, who now resides in California with his family, has expressed reluctance to bring his children to the UK due to security concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. The company attributed its success to volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, as well as cost-cutting measures, which offset lower earnings from weak oil prices. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy" due to President Trump's tariffs raising uncertainty about demand. Exxon's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, while its refining business posted a 40% decrease in profit.</p>

Spotify users can now see subscription costs, purchase subscriptions, and use payment methods other than Apple's system.

          <p>The Pentagon's procurement system is undergoing an overhaul to address outdated thinking and bureaucratic processes that hinder the military's ability to acquire new weapons systems quickly. The Army's Chief Technology Officer, Alex Miller, highlighted the need to modernize more rapidly and cut red tape. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing an overhaul of the Army's acquisitions process, emphasizing the need to divest outdated programs and restructure acquisition systems. The Army is now sending requirement writers into the field to gather real-time feedback from soldiers and rewriting regulations to streamline the process.</p>

The report comes amid an uncertain economic climate due to Trump's tariffs, but traders have pushed out expectations for an interest rate cut until July.

The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses. The de minimis exemption, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, allowed retailers to ship packages to US customers without duties or taxes.</p>

CD accounts are safe investments, generally coming with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Short-term CDs have higher interest rates than longer terms.
