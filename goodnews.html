          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has officially won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, securing the highest number of votes in the city's primary history. After three rounds of ranked-choice voting, Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo by a significant margin, a result his campaign is framing as a mandate for progressive policies. The victory highlights a notable leftward shift in NYC politics, prompting discussions between Mamdani and state leaders like Governor Kathy Hochul about shared goals and community concerns.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty delivered an explosive and energetic rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably consistent and powerful, and he played guitar for the entire two-hour show, demonstrating his enduring talent and stage presence to a large crowd.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have vowed to triple their trade flows. The move comes after former President Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on any country participating in the BRICS economic bloc, which he accused of undermining the U.S. dollar. This development highlights the growing efforts by emerging economies in the Global South to strengthen their own alliances and reform Western-dominated international institutions in response to an "America First" posture.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that as the United States pulls back from its traditional role in global development, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill the void. The article contrasts the dismantling of U.S. aid agencies with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation headquartered in the city. It suggests that Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status and connection to Beijing's growing influence can make it a new hub for providing global public goods, particularly for nations in the Global South.</p>

          <p>An Instagram post by British television personality Gemma Collins promoting a weight-loss service has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The regulator found that the ad illegally promoted a prescription-only weight-loss medication to the public, even though a specific drug was not named. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which banned nine similar adverts for breaching rules against advertising prescription drugs directly to consumers, highlighting growing regulatory focus on influencer marketing.</p>
