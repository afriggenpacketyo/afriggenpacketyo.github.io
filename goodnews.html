          <p>Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, jumped 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case. The court decided against the Department of Justice's most severe proposal, which would have forced Google to sell its Chrome browser. While Google must end exclusive default-search-engine contracts and share some search data, investors reacted positively to the company avoiding the worst-case penalties, viewing the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant.</p>

          <p>In a major antitrust ruling, a federal judge has ordered Google to alter its business practices but stopped short of forcing a divestiture of its Chrome browser. The decision requires Google to end exclusive contracts that made it the default search engine on many devices and to share some user interaction data with rivals. Judge Amit Mehta's ruling, which also establishes a compliance oversight committee, is the most significant outcome in a tech antitrust case in over two decades, though it falls short of the DOJ's more aggressive demands.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry veteran Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal. The acquisition is being led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, Apollo, and Brookfield. This move signals further consolidation within the aircraft leasing industry, which has seen record rental rates due to a shortage of new planes, and will create a larger, more scaled company based in Dublin.

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight increase on Tuesday, rising above the $110,000 mark while the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The cryptocurrency's movement contrasted with gold, which surged to a new record high of over $3,500, reaffirming its traditional safe-haven status. Market strategists note that while Bitcoin benefits from some of the same economic uncertainties driving gold, its performance has been tempered by a significant rotation of investment into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum throughout the third quarter.

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student and prominent organizer of campus protests against the war in Gaza, has returned to Columbia University to begin his graduate studies. His return comes four months after he was arrested by federal immigration authorities and nearly deported in a case his lawyers called retaliatory for his activism.

          <p>Howard Webb, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal by Fulham's Josh King during their recent match against Chelsea was a "misjudgement." The goal was overturned after a lengthy VAR review for a foul in the build-up, a decision that drew heavy criticism from Fulham's manager. Webb stated that the incident did not meet the high threshold required for a VAR intervention and that such a goal should only be taken away when the evidence of a clear error is present.</p>

          <p>Musician Drake has placed a $300,000 bet on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to win the US Open, a wager that would pay out over half a million dollars. The bet has drawn attention due to the "Drake Curse," a popular narrative that the subjects of his large public wagers often lose. This phenomenon has been noted across various sports, including a previous losing bet on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in the 2024 US Open final, making his wagers a recurring cultural subplot at major sporting events.</p>

          <p>For individuals facing substantial credit card debt, such as $20,000, financial experts suggest several structured approaches to regain control. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement, or consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate. Alternatively, personal strategies like the "debt avalanche" or "debt snowball" methods can be effective, as can increasing income through a side hustle or making significant budget cuts to free up funds for repayment.

Trump had previously selected Huntsville during his first term, a choice that was later halted over concerns it could risk military readiness. The move to Alabama's "Rocket City" is expected to bring thousands of jobs and significant investment to the reliably Republican state, a decision the president claimed was not influenced by political dynamics.</p>

          <p>Despite national attention and political rhetoric focusing on Chicago's gun violence, recent data indicates a substantial decrease in violent crime this year. According to an analysis, robberies have fallen by a third compared to last year, and the city is projected to have its lowest murder rate in over a decade. The article suggests that while street theft remains a concern, the perception of widespread violent crime, particularly in tourist areas, may be misaligned with current statistical trends.</p>
