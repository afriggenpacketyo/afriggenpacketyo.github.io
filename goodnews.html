        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue reached $45.68 billion against a predicted $44.06 billion, indicating resilience in both its Wall Street and Main Street operations. Analysts note that market volatility and high asset levels have benefited the sector, while credit losses have remained low due to stable U.S. employment. The positive report has contributed to a recent surge in bank stocks, setting an optimistic tone for other major banks reporting this week. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has officially launched its Model Y in India, opening its first showroom in Mumbai with plans for another in New Delhi. The electric SUV is priced at approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other markets due to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes. This pricing positions Tesla in the premium vehicle segment, competing with brands like BMW rather than mass-market EV manufacturers. Experts suggest this initial move is a strategy to "test the waters" and build a brand presence before committing to local manufacturing, which could eventually lower costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to encourage citizens with low-interest savings accounts to invest in stocks and shares. Under the proposals, banks would actively send investment information to savers, supported by a government advertising campaign. This initiative, part of the "Leeds Reforms" to boost the UK's financial services sector, also aims to make a low-deposit mortgage scheme for first-time buyers permanent. The Treasury will also review risk warnings on investment products, though some express concern that this might be exploited by fraudsters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has revealed plans to invest $25 billion over the next two years in data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The investment will span 13 states covered by the PJM Interconnection, the largest electric grid in the U.S., which includes the major data center hub in northern Virginia. As part of this initiative, Google will also spend $3 billion to upgrade two hydropower plants in Pennsylvania to help meet the increasing energy demands of its facilities. This move comes as tech and energy leaders meet with government officials to discuss AI investment.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Province Extends Paid Marriage Leave to Boost Marriage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 06:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in China's central Hubei province have quintupled the length of paid marriage leave to 15 days in an effort to encourage more couples to marry. This policy is the latest local government initiative aimed at reversing the country's declining marriage and birth rates. China's marriage registrations have fallen to their lowest level since record-keeping began in 1978, with many young people deterred by the high costs associated with weddings and starting a family. The extended leave is part of a broader push to create a more "family-friendly society" and address demographic challenges.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, nicknamed "Big Dumper," won the All-Star Home Run Derby, making him the first catcher in history to secure the title. Raleigh, who led the major leagues with 38 home runs at the All-Star break, defeated Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round. His victory also marks the first time a switch-hitter has won the competition. The event featured impressive displays of power, including a 513-foot home run by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, but Raleigh's consistent performance ultimately earned him the $1 million prize.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about wildfire season, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) is highlighting its free mobile app, Colorado Trail Explorer (COTREX), which allows users to track active wildfires and prescribed burns. While southeastern Colorado currently faces a low fire risk, other parts of the state are experiencing extreme drought, making the tool valuable for outdoor enthusiasts. The app aggregates data from 236 land managers, providing real-time alerts, trail closures, and safety hazards for over 45,000 miles of trails. It serves as a comprehensive planning tool for recreationists to make informed decisions before heading outdoors.</p>

          <p>Schools in England will be required to teach students how to recognize and counter misogyny as part of updated relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) guidance. The curriculum will also emphasize identifying positive male role models and proactively engaging parents about what their children are learning. The new guidance abandons previous proposals for strict age limits on topics, instead outlining what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school. By secondary school, the curriculum will also address incel culture, AI-generated sexual imagery, and sexual ethics beyond consent.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy in Minnesota is recovering after a fall caused an arrow to impale his head, travel through his brain, and stop just short of exiting the back of his skull. The boy, Gus Deterding, was helping his father pack for a hunting trip when he slipped on ice and fell face-first onto the arrow. After he pulled it out himself, scans at the hospital revealed the shocking extent of the injury. Doctors expressed astonishment that the wound was not fatal, with one specialist calling his survival unprecedented in his career and attributing it to incredible fortune.</p>

          <p>Amid a shifting geopolitical landscape, France is emerging as a potential leader in Europe's push for "strategic autonomy" in defense. Spurred by the war in Ukraine and changing U.S. priorities, the EU is planning massive defense investments, and France is doubling its own defense budget between 2017 and 2027. Experts note that France has maintained a robust domestic defense industry and a "war culture" that gives it an analytical edge. However, to effectively lead, France must overcome challenges like raw material sourcing and skilled labor shortages, and collaborate diplomatically with other European nations.</p>

          <p>Left-arm spinner Liam Dawson has been called into the England cricket squad for the fourth Test against India, marking a potential return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old Hampshire player replaces off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who was ruled out of the series with a broken finger. Dawson's selection comes as a reward for outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His inclusion provides a direct replacement for Bashir and also strengthens England's lower-order batting ahead of the crucial match in Manchester.</p>
