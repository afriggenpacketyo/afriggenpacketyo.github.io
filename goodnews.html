          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:02:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT are pioneering a novel approach to fight Lyme disease by genetically engineering white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the bacteria. The project, named "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice with heritable immunity to Lyme, thereby breaking the transmission cycle to ticks that bite them. This method avoids eradicating the mice, preserving their role in the ecosystem, while potentially reducing the incidence of the disease in humans. The team is actively engaging with the community on Nantucket, an island with a high rate of Lyme disease, to ensure public buy-in before any potential field trials.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened as a new institution dedicated to the "fearless pursuit of truth," emphasizing open debate and intellectual diversity in response to what its founders see as a crisis of self-censorship in higher education. Backed by prominent figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university offers free tuition for its inaugural class and a curriculum rooted in Western civilization. Critics have labeled it a right-wing "anti-woke" university, but its founders insist the goal is to be a non-political space for rigorous inquiry. The school is currently operating in a downtown Austin building while seeking full accreditation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies, which can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, undertakes an extraordinary 3,000-mile migration from Canada and the U.S. to a specific forest in Mexico. These butterflies suppress their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the journey, navigating with an internal compass. Scientists and conservationists are working to protect this phenomenon, which is threatened by habitat loss, particularly the decline of milkweed plants essential for their life cycle. The annual arrival of the butterflies in Mexico coincides with the Day of the Dead, where they are culturally revered as the returning souls of ancestors.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded their regular season home schedule with a 3-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, despite a strong performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan. A late-inning bullpen collapse allowed the Giants to take the lead in the eighth inning. The game marked a franchise attendance record for the Dodgers, surpassing four million fans for the season. Despite the loss, the team's focus remains on clinching the NL West division title and preparing for their guaranteed home games in the upcoming playoffs.</p>

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, the former UK Deputy Prime Minister, has described the current Prime Minister Keir Starmer's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump as "cringey" and "a bit embarrassing." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg criticized what he termed "endless knee-bending" and urged the prime minister to "speak up" for British values rather than solely courting the unpredictable U.S. leader for a trade deal. He argued that the UK government is miscalculating its position, suggesting it will eventually have to choose between aligning with the U.S. or the EU. Clegg's comments reflect ongoing debates about the UK's foreign policy direction post-Brexit.</p>

          <p>British Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana has announced she is seeking to "reconcile and move forward" with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn following a public falling out over the formation of a new left-wing political party. The dispute escalated after Sultana accused Corbyn's circle of being a "sexist boys' club" and initiated legal action over what she called "baseless attacks." She has since dropped the legal action, and both parties are reportedly engaged in discussions to resolve their differences ahead of the new party's planned inaugural conference. The conflict has exposed deep divisions within the nascent political movement.</p>

          <p>While the path from an MBA program to a venture capital firm remains viable, its prominence is declining as the industry evolves. A recent study shows a drop in the percentage of venture professionals holding MBAs compared to the early 2000s. Firms are now placing a higher value on technical and operational experience, especially in specialized fields like AI and hardware, leading them to recruit talent directly from tech companies. Despite this shift and the high cost of tuition, interest in VC careers among MBA students remains strong, with hundreds joining campus venture capital clubs. (not investment advice)</p>

The potential sale is a result of a 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. The involvement of the Murdochs, who control a vast media empire, would add another powerful player to the future of the popular social media platform in America. (not investment advice)</p>

Alberto then made a unique request: to play catch with Trout on the field, a favor the future Hall of Famer happily granted. The home run, which traveled an estimated 485 feet, made Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the 400-homer mark.

He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run.

He expressed hope that former President Trump, if re-elected, could resume talks with Kim Jong Un, believing the two leaders share a degree of mutual trust.

The bear then climbed out and ran off in the opposite direction, with no one being harmed in the incident.

Post-race analysis suggests Norris's result was largely dictated by a compromised qualifying session where he hit the wall, though he argued his track position was the main factor.
