          <p>A direct air corridor for fresh fruit has been established between Cambodia and China, marked by the first two-tonne shipment of Cambodian durians arriving in Henan province. This development makes durian the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct import into the Chinese market, following bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. The new air route, which uses cold chain logistics to transport the fruit in just four hours, signifies growing agricultural trade ties between the two nations. Despite the expansion, some industry insiders express caution regarding the commercial competitiveness of Cambodian durians.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of bilateral cooperation, Mexico has extradited 26 high-level cartel members to the United States to face justice for various crimes, including drug trafficking and murder. The group includes prominent figures such as Abigael González Valencia of the 'Los Cuinis' organization, which is closely allied with the powerful CJNG cartel. This move is a milestone for the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle drug trafficking networks and follows a previous extradition of 29 cartel figures. The cooperation comes amid ongoing pressure from Washington on Mexico to curb the flow of illicit drugs across the border.</p>

Jurors, however, convicted her of driving under the influence.

U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the suspension violated her previous order blocking such terminations, stating the indefinite suspensions 'differ from a termination in name only.' The administration had cited alleged discrimination and antisemitism at the university as reasons for the freeze, but the court's decision provides leverage for UCLA in resisting what Governor Gavin Newsom has called 'extortion.'</p>

          <p>China has initiated a year-long program to subsidize interest costs for personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support the economy. Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on loans for purchases like cars and education, with the central government funding 90% of the cost. The policy, running from September 2025 to August 2026, is designed to lower credit costs for households and channel more funds into the consumption sector. Officials hope this will help make domestic consumption the primary driver of China's economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer for Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. While the bid is higher than Perplexity's current valuation, the company claims to have backing from investors. Industry analysts have called the move a 'stunt,' noting the offer is likely far below Chrome's true value and that it is unclear if Google is even considering a sale of the world's most popular browser.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a significant 19-point lead in the New York City mayoral race, with 44% of voter support. His closest competitor, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, polled at 25%, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also an independent, garnered only 7%. The poll also showed a tightening race for New York governor, with incumbent Kathy Hochul's lead over potential Republican challenger Elise Stefanik shrinking. Mamdani's strong performance highlights a potential leftward shift in NYC politics, though leading centrist Democrats have yet to endorse him.</p>

          <p>The UK's driving theory test for cars and motorcycles will include questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and how to use a defibrillator starting in early 2026. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) hopes the change will help prevent avoidable deaths, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a cardiac arrest. Learning materials have already been updated to teach the 2.4 million people who take the test annually these life-saving skills. Evidence suggests that immediate CPR and defibrillator use can increase survival rates from under 10% to as high as 70%.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used 'repressive violence' in Cameroon during the nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost 'tens of thousands of lives.' This admission follows a 2022 historical report which found that French colonial troops engaged in mass forced displacement and supported brutal militias. The acknowledgment is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history, though it comes at a time of growing anti-French sentiment in its former African colonies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market surged on Tuesday, with major indices like the S&P 500 approaching all-time highs, following the release of favorable inflation data. Consumer prices in July rose 2.7% year-over-year, slightly below economists' expectations and fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut in September. This positive economic signal increased traders' bets on a rate reduction, which would lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. Despite the optimism, some analysts remain cautious, pointing to the potential future impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
