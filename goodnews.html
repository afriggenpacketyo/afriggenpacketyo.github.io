          <h2>Newcastle United Explores Potential Record Signing of Striker Hugo Ekitike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:35:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United is actively pursuing a deal to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike. The 23-year-old Frenchman had an impressive season in the Bundesliga, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists. A potential transfer would likely set a new club record for Newcastle, costing over £70 million and surpassing the £63 million paid for Alexander Isak in 2022. Despite the interest in Ekitike, the club has firmly stated it has no intention of selling Isak, who has been linked with other top European clubs. Ekitike joined Frankfurt permanently last summer and is under contract for four more years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team has scheduled two friendly matches for the October international window, facing Ecuador in Austin, Texas, and Australia in Commerce City, Colorado. These games will serve as crucial preparation ahead of the 2026 World Cup, pitting the U.S. against two teams that have already qualified for the tournament. Ecuador is currently second in South American qualifying, while Australia secured its spot after a strong run under new coach Tony Popovic. The matches will be an opportunity for U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino to integrate key players like Christian Pulisic with rising talents who featured in the recent Gold Cup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move within the competitive AI sector, startup Cognition is set to acquire Windsurf, an AI coding company. The deal comes just days after Windsurf's CEO and other senior staff were poached by Google in a multi-billion dollar licensing and compensation package. Cognition, known for its AI coding agent Devin, will acquire Windsurf's intellectual property, brand, and remaining talent, though financial terms were not disclosed. The acquisition highlights the intense 'talent war' among major tech companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, all vying for top-tier AI engineers and researchers to gain a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. stock indices closed slightly higher on Monday, largely brushing off the Trump administration's weekend announcement of new tariffs targeting the European Union and Mexico. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a modest gain of 0.2%, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showing similar small increases. The new levies, set to take effect August 1, revived trade tensions and threatened to increase consumer prices. In response, Mexican officials called the deal unfair, while the EU emphasized its commitment to a constructive transatlantic partnership, indicating a complex and uncertain path forward for international trade relations.

          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab jumped nearly 11% on Monday, continuing a strong rally that has seen the stock's value almost double in the past two months. This recent surge is attributed to a series of successful launches of its Electron rocket and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company, which now has a market value over $19 billion, is successfully competing in a growing commercial space industry against rivals like SpaceX. CEO Peter Beck noted that the company is now producing a new rocket every 15 days to meet increasing demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value soared to a new record high, trading above $120,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation. This rally occurs as the U.S. House begins its "Crypto Week" to deliberate on bills aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, a move supported by the Trump administration. Analysts suggest the surge is primarily fueled by long-term institutional buyers, with some projecting further increases in the near future. However, potential risks remain, including the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy in response to tariff-related inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the second year in a row, homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased, with the 2025 annual count showing a 4% overall reduction and a nearly 10% drop in the number of people living on the streets. Officials attribute the positive trend to significant investments and focused efforts like Mayor Karen Bass’s Inside Safe initiative, which moves people from encampments into interim housing. While the unsheltered population has seen a notable 14% decline over two years, the number of people in shelters has risen. Leaders acknowledge the progress but face challenges in securing permanent housing amid budget cuts.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has ordered prosecutors to justify why the murder convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez should not be re-examined. The order is in response to a petition from the brothers citing new evidence that supports their long-standing claims of sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez. This new evidence includes a recently discovered letter and a declaration from former Menudo member Roy Rossello, who stated he was also sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. The brothers, convicted in 1996 for killing their parents, were recently resentenced, making them eligible for parole, and this ruling could potentially lead to a new trial.</p>
