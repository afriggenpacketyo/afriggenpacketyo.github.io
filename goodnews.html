          <h2>California Bill Proposes Misdemeanor for Officers Covering Faces on Duty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 17:50:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have introduced a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty, aiming to increase transparency and public trust. The bill requires officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name or identifier, with exceptions for the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The proposal follows concerns about federal officers conducting raids with covered faces and unmarked vehicles, leading to allegations of disappearing people. Supporters argue that accountability is essential for public servants.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's opening match in the Club World Cup took place before a stadium with many empty seats, raising concerns about the tournament's appeal to fans. Experts suggest the Monday afternoon kickoff time, high ticket prices, and lack of marketing contributed to the low attendance. The event is being held in the US for the first time. Some observers worry this could be an early sign of potential challenges for the upcoming World Cup in 2026, emphasizing the need for realistic ticket pricing and effective marketing strategies.</p>
