          <p>Japan's central bank maintained its policy rate at 0.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. Despite initially reaching a new record high, the Nikkei 225 index fell by 0.57% following the announcement. The decision comes as Japan's core inflation rate slowed for the third consecutive month, dropping to 2.7% in August. The Bank of Japan's cautious approach prioritizes stability amid global economic uncertainty and a domestic reflationary cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected President Donald Trump's call to use military force to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force has the primary responsibility for policing borders, though the Navy can provide support if needed. He emphasized that the military's main focus is on national defense and global security issues. The comments came during Trump's state visit, where he advocated for a more forceful approach to illegal migration.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 went on sale worldwide, drawing significant crowds in major cities from Beijing to London. The launch is seen as a crucial test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. While initial demand, particularly for premium models, appears strong, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout. The new models feature design changes, improved battery life, and larger storage options.</p>

While emphasizing India's non-involvement, the former commander also criticized China's aggressive actions in the region. He suggested that as a large and powerful nation, China should act with more magnanimity toward smaller countries. The comments refer to recent clashes where Chinese coast guard ships have confronted Philippine vessels.</p>

          <p>Listed companies from China's Xinjiang region saw their stock prices soar, with some hitting the 10 percent daily limit on mainland exchanges. This investor enthusiasm is fueled by Xinjiang's strong economic performance, which grew by 5.7% in the first half of the year, surpassing China's national average. The rally is also driven by speculation about new policy support from Beijing, including the potential development of an artificial intelligence data center in the resource-rich region. A gauge tracking 61 Xinjiang-based firms has gained 26% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees residing in Germany has decreased, according to new government statistics. The refugee population fell by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025, down to a total of 3.5 million people. This figure includes asylum seekers, long-term residents, and over 1.2 million refugees from Ukraine. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including an increase in deportations, voluntary departures, and a significant number of naturalizations, particularly among Syrian nationals.</p>
