          <h2>Chinese Fossil Study Sheds Light on Bird Flight Evolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 21:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Chinese study examining dinosaur feathers trapped in amber provides new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, a crucial development that enabled early birds to surpass dinosaurs in aerial capabilities. The research team analyzed the structure of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period to understand feather evolution during this time. The study highlights the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift as an essential feature in the evolution of birds, distinguishing them from most feathered dinosaurs that lacked the same flight capabilities. While some ancient dinosaur species could glide or achieve powered flight, modern birds are their direct descendants, and the detailed analysis of these fossilized feathers helps clarify the evolutionary steps that led to avian flight. The article underscores the importance of feathers in the evolution of birds, shedding light on their success in conquering the skies.</p>

          <p>Marissa Rothenberger, a transgender pitcher, propelled the Champlin Park Rebels to the Minnesota High School Girls' Softball State Championship with a complete game and two doubles. Rothenberger's performance included giving up two early runs but settling in to secure a 3-2 victory over White Bear Lake in the Class AAAA state semifinals. Her hitting proved crucial, as she led off the fifth inning with a double to spark a rally and again in the seventh with another double, leading to the game-winning run. The game sparked controversy, with some parents expressing frustration over the fairness of allowing a transgender athlete to compete against cisgender female athletes, leading to discussions about state-level laws and policies that determine eligibility based on gender identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may protect against dangerous infections, specifically reducing the risk of hospitalization for lung infections in young children. The study, conducted by University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns to identify early microbial species and track their health outcomes for two years. The presence of Bifidobacterium longum in early infancy was found to have a protective effect, with babies harboring this species being significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. Researchers believe that these bacteria, or compounds they produce, interact with the immune system, influencing its maturation and ability to distinguish between harmful and beneficial entities.</p>

Myles Turner of the Pacers highlighted that this Finals represents a new blueprint for the league, moving away from the era of super teams.

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK drugs regulator, doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant.</p>
