          <p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, a spokesperson confirmed. Diagnosed in May 2025 with a Gleason score of 9 and bone metastasis, the former president's treatment began "a few weeks ago" in Philadelphia, with sources indicating he is responding positively. This health update follows his successful treatment for basal cell carcinoma two years prior, highlighting ongoing medical concerns for the former leader. Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer affecting men, with age being a primary risk factor, making this a significant public health development.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series was notably poor, raising concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series. The soon-to-be four-time MVP winner recorded only one hit in 18 at-bats with nine strikeouts, often struggling against left-handed pitching. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the challenging matchups but stressed Ohtani's need to "recalibrate" his approach, urging him to improve his "at-bat quality" by being less aggressive outside the strike zone and more active within it. The article underscores the Dodgers' championship aspirations, noting they "won’t win the World Series with that sort of performance" from their star.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen, known as the 'White Rhino,' suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russia's Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at Sheffield Arena. Despite a raucous 9,000-strong home crowd and a determined effort, including landing significant body shots and an overhand right, judges scored the bout 115-111, 117-109, and 116-10 in Makhmudov's favor. This marked Allen's first time headlining at the venue, a significant moment for the boxer who briefly retired five years ago. Allen, 33, expressed his emotion and determination to continue, having rebuilt his career after previous setbacks and aiming for more big nights like this.</p>

          <p>The UK clocks will go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October, specifically at 02:00 BST on October 26, 2025, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, easily remembered by the phrase "spring forward, fall back," grants most people an extra hour but extends night shifts. The practice, initiated by Germany in 1916 during WWI to save fuel, has continued with ongoing debates about whether the UK should adopt year-round BST. Arguments for permanent BST include potential economic boosts and reduced evening road accidents, while critics highlight the very gloomy winter mornings it would create, particularly in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's participation in the Lakers' upcoming preseason game against the Golden State Warriors remains "TBD," according to coach JJ Redick, despite Doncic being a full participant in practice. Doncic anticipates playing two preseason games before the regular season begins on October 21. A significant challenge for the Lakers is the absence of LeBron James, who is sidelined for three to four weeks with a sciatica nerve issue, forcing the team to adopt a "next man up" mentality. This article highlights the team's need to adapt without James, though Doncic asserts he will not carry an undue burden and is focused on team wins. The team has known about James' nerve irritation since the summer.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her personal story of initial shock and subsequent understanding after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science after death. Patsy, a bowel cancer survivor, views it as a profound way to give back to medical professionals and aid future doctors, expressing gratitude for her own care. Owen's documentary explored Cardiff University's anatomy center, where donated bodies are used for teaching, highlighting the "silent teachers'" importance and the emotional connection students develop.

          <p>Britain is experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, including common colds, flu, and Covid-19, leading many to wonder why "everyone is sick right now." Experts attribute this to a "perfect breeding ground" in autumn, with children returning to school and people spending more time indoors, facilitating virus spread. Data from the UK Health Security Agency shows an increase in Rhinovirus and Covid-19, driven by new variants, with flu also on the rise in younger age groups. While current illness levels are not considered particularly high, the article advises vaccination for eligible individuals and basic hygiene, like handwashing and staying home when sick, to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>China is drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will redefine its development priorities, particularly regarding infrastructure spending. Historically, these plans have driven massive public works, like the 2009 stimulus package, which propelled economic growth but also burdened local governments with debt. The upcoming plan is expected to shift towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects, moving beyond simply linking populations and overcoming geographic hurdles. This article examines how the document reflects high-level policy, noting that despite past debt concerns, officials and government advisers still see considerable value in strategic infrastructure investments for future growth (not investment advice).</p>

The US is strengthening its lead through multibillion-dollar deals to advance chip supplies to the UAE, creating facilities like the Stargate UAE AI data center built on US technology. The article argues that the US has a critical advantage due to the convergence of Nvidia's investment demands and the Trump administration's financial stakes in semiconductor companies. This approach accelerates data center production, posing a significant challenge to China's bid for near-term dominance in the $242 billion industry (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deploy the National Guard in Illinois, partially upholding a lower court's decision. The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit deemed the deployment "likely to lead to civil unrest" and "only add fuel to the fire." While the court allowed the Guard to remain under federal control for now, it sided with Illinois officials who argued the deployment was a "grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty." This article highlights ongoing legal battles over Trump's use of federal troops in Democratic-led cities like Chicago, Portland, and Los Angeles, often citing concerns over immigration and crime, with similar deployments previously blocked in Oregon.</p>
