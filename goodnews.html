          <p>Toyota's global sales for April increased by 10% year-on-year, according to a Kyodo News report. The announcement comes as the automotive industry anticipates potential impacts from forthcoming U.S. tariffs. While the article is brief, it suggests a positive trend for Toyota amidst broader economic uncertainties. The sales increase could be attributed to various factors, including pent-up demand, successful marketing strategies, or favorable market conditions in specific regions. The report highlights the company's performance just before possible trade policy changes that could affect future sales and strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS has won an appellate court ruling allowing the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" while its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television continues. Sony, which owns and produces the shows, had sought to terminate its distribution deal with CBS, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and budget cuts. CBS appealed a previous ruling that favored Sony, and the appellate panel granted CBS's request to maintain the status quo during the appeal process. CBS argues that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, highlighting the network's decades-long role in distributing the popular game shows.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the recent quarter, driven by a significant increase in data center sales. The company's stock experienced a rise in extended trading following the announcement. While the company anticipates continued strong sales in the current quarter, it acknowledged a negative impact from export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry due to these restrictions, but demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure remains incredibly strong.

          <p>The government has announced that two major new reservoir projects in England have been fast-tracked in a bid to shore up water supplies. The projects, located in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire, have been declared "nationally significant", allowing them to speed through the planning process. However, the reservoirs could still be more than a decade away from opening, and household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population. The announcement means that final decisions about the reservoirs will be taken by the Environment Secretary, rather than at a local level.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from the south of Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes they might nest in the area. A young male eagle named Talla was sighted in Northumberland, thanks to the efforts of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP). The project has successfully translocated eagles to the Scottish Borders, leading to a resurgence in their population. These birds have also been spotted in the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire, marking a potentially exciting milestone for wildlife conservation.</p>

          <p>S. Jack Hu, formerly the University of Georgia's provost, has been named the new chancellor of UC Riverside, effective July 15.
