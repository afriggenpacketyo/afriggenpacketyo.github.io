        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's social media announcement about renaming Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House clarified that it would be an additional proclamation, not a replacement. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that they are not renaming Veteran's Day and it will simply be an additional proclamation. Trump also intended to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval. This article clarifies the Trump administration's stance and the process for creating federal holidays.</p>

          <p>A federal judge permanently struck down Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order that targeted the firm Perkins Coie, which once worked with his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton, after declaring in an extraordinary ruling that the order was unconstitutional and unlawful. The judge criticized the order for violating the first, fifth, and sixth amendments. The executive order had barred federal employees from engaging with Perkins Coie attorneys and restricted their access to federal buildings. The judge deemed the order retaliatory and a violation of viewpoint discrimination. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the rising number of autism diagnoses, attributing it to changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, rather than a true increase in the prevalence of autism. The definition of autism has broadened over time, encompassing conditions like Asperger's syndrome and "pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified" (PDD-NOS). Furthermore, there's a growing recognition of autism in women and adults, who were previously often misdiagnosed or overlooked. While some worry about the potential glamorization of autism, others emphasize the importance of diagnosis for providing support and improving mental health. The article presents different perspectives on the implications of the rising diagnosis rates.</p>

          <p>A report alleges that Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, has been exerting influence over his career decisions. Hudson reportedly "forced her way into" a Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial and allegedly demanded to be an executive producer on HBO's "Hard Knocks" after Belichick became the head coach at North Carolina. She is also said to have been included in emails with UNC staff. These reports have surfaced amidst increased public attention on their relationship following Belichick's arrival on social media and their attendance at various events.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a significant departure from previous practices. This policy change mandates that new vaccines must be tested against a placebo in clinical trials. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether this includes updated versions of existing vaccines like the flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety and advocated for placebo-based trials. Experts say the practice is necessary to determine if a vaccine is not only effective, but also safe.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, solidifying its position as a challenger to Britain's main parties. The party won hundreds of seats and gained control of several authorities, primarily from the Conservatives. Reform also secured its first mayoral contests. The results highlight the fragmentation of the British political landscape and the growing dissatisfaction with traditional parties. Farage aims to use this momentum to gain a stronger foothold in town halls ahead of the next general election.</p>

The AfD came second in federal elections, winning a record number of seats. The BfV, Germany's intelligence agency, stated that the AfD aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society. The new classification gives authorities greater powers to monitor the AfD. Some officials are calling for a ban on the AfD.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies found in the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Friede endured more than 200 bites and 700 injections of venom from some of the world's deadliest snakes. The research focused on elapids, identifying two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target neurotoxins. This could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites.</p>
