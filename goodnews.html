          <h2>German Military Survey Finds Limited Extremist Attitudes Among Soldiers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences found that fewer than 1% of German soldiers harbor right-wing extremist attitudes. While the report offers some relief amid recent stories of far-right networks within the military, it also found that 6.4% of soldiers have chauvinist attitudes and 3.5% have xenophobic attitudes. Some researchers are skeptical of the survey's safeguards and whether the Bundeswehr is doing enough to keep extremist attitudes out of the military, especially with the rise of right-wing attitudes in society. The German military has stronger anti-extremism measures in place than most NATO countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, the United States faces transportation challenges with slashed funding and decaying infrastructure. The author contrasts Europe's investment in rail with America's car-centric culture and focus on unproven technologies. The article suggests that revitalized railways in the US could offer a more sustainable and connected way forward, fostering community and shared purpose. The author points to the secrets to China's fantastically successful matrix of high-speed railways which are clear: consistency of vision, courage of conviction, a successful nationwide rollout and, crucially, adequate funding.</p>

          <p>Poland commenced its presidential election amidst heightened security concerns due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and worries about weakening US commitment to European security. The front-runners are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a pro-EU Warsaw Mayor, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. Trzaskowski supports abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki champions conservative values and national sovereignty. The election is also testing the strength of far-right candidate S≈Çawomir Mentzen, who blends MAGA rhetoric with libertarian economics.

          <p>China is shifting its approach to funding infrastructure projects in Africa by using public-private partnerships (PPPs). This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, moving away from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. Projects such as Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are now being funded through PPPs. During Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Uganda, with Chinese contractors gaining exclusive rights to operate the railway for at least 25 years.</p>

This repatriation effort aims to bring home 2,000 people, who fled Rwanda after the genocide that killed up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Many of the returnees have never seen Rwanda, and the repatriation is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR.</p>
