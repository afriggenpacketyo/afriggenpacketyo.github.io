          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to drive voter engagement and rebuild support following the party's 2024 election losses. The program will focus on registering voters and connecting with them through non-traditional channels like community groups and social media. With an initial six-figure investment, the effort aims to deploy thousands of volunteers in key districts and states ahead of the 2025 and 2026 elections. This move is also seen as an attempt to unify the party after recent internal disputes.</p>

          <p>Canada has canceled its digital services tax (DST) on large tech companies to restart critical trade and defense negotiations with the United States. The move came after President Trump threatened to impose new tariffs, labeling the tax a "direct and blatant attack" on the U.S. This development raises questions about whether other countries, including several in the European Union that have similar taxes, will face pressure to also abandon their DSTs. The core of the issue is the debate over how to fairly tax multinational digital giants that generate substantial revenue in countries where they have no physical headquarters.</p>

          <p>The WNBA has officially announced its expansion with three new teams set to join the league in Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia. This move will grow the league to 18 teams over the next five years, with Cleveland starting in 2028, followed by Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia in 2030. The expansion reflects the league's significant growth in popularity and market viability, with each new franchise paying a record fee of $250 million.

          <p>The trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada has been fraught with tension since President Trump took office, escalating with threats of tariffs and disputes over a Canadian digital services tax (DST). After Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs in early 2025, a series of pauses, retaliatory measures, and negotiations followed. The conflict reached a new peak when Canada planned to implement its DST, prompting Trump to suspend trade talks. Canada has since rescinded the tax to resume negotiations, with both sides now aiming for a new trade agreement by July 21.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is developing a plan to grant a "temporary pass" to farmers and hospitality businesses to mitigate the impact of increased immigration enforcement. Acknowledging that raids can remove long-term workers who are difficult to replace, Trump stated a need to protect these industries while still removing criminals from the country. This potential policy would allow certain workers to remain, possibly by paying taxes, giving employers like farmers more control over their workforce. The comments signal a potential shift in enforcement priorities for key sectors of the economy.</p>

A new notice from NOAA indicates the delay was requested by NASA and that the original plan was intended to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk.

All 22 banks surveyed passed the tests, which simulate a severe economic downturn, but these two firms saw the most significant reductions in their required stress capital buffers. This easing of capital requirements could allow the banks to increase shareholder returns through higher dividends and stock buybacks. The results are seen as further evidence of a more favorable regulatory environment for large banks under the current administration. (not investment advice)</p>
