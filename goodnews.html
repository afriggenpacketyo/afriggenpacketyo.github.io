          <p>Curtis Jackson, a seemingly healthy father of three, received a rare cancer diagnosis after a routine life insurance physical.  He was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a deadly cancer often detected too late for a cure.  Jackson underwent chemotherapy, radiation, and ultimately a successful liver transplant.  He is recovering well and advocating for organ donation.</p>
