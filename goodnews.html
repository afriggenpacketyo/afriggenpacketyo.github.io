          <h2>Roses Are Believed to Have Originated as Yellow Flowers, Study Suggests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the association of red roses with love and romance today. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to reconstruct the ancestral traits of the flower. The research team concluded that the common ancestor of Rosa most likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets, challenging the traditional perception of roses.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years due to the resumption of development projects suspended during the pandemic. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced that the offshore well blowout off the coast of Louisiana, which began on April 26, has been controlled after more than a week of oil shooting out of an unused well. Cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing, involving federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private contractors. The Coast Guard reported minimal wildlife impact, with one oiled bird spotted near the spill site. The incident highlights the broader challenge of orphaned and aging oil wells in Louisiana and the need for continued efforts to cap these wells and prevent future spills.</p>
