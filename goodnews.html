          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival is exploring themes of war, discrimination, and transformation through contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces. The festival includes performances such as the "Queer Passion," which addresses the suffering of LGBTQ+ people, particularly in countries like Russia and the USA, and the "Arabian Passion," which promotes peace between the West and the East amidst Middle East conflicts. This year's festival motto is "transformation," reflecting changes in the economy, the digital world, and the climate, and how these themes resonate within Bach's music. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive, showcasing Bach's enduring relevance in addressing contemporary issues. Bach's music is being presented in new and relevant ways, highlighting its power to address issues of oppression and conflict. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The system aims to protect the entire United States, but experts note that building such a system would be significantly more complex than Israel's due to the country's larger size and the types of missiles it would need to defend against. While Israel's Iron Dome intercepts many missiles, building a similar system in the U.S. presents substantial challenges. The proposal highlights ongoing debates about national security and defense strategies. </p>

          <p>Bullet train services on the Tohoku shinkansen line between Tokyo and Sendai were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stopped between stations.

          <p>Chris Woakes is set to return to the England team for the upcoming five-Test series against India, making his presence more important than ever. Woakes, the oldest player in the squad at 36, is expected to bowl the first over for England, utilizing his accuracy and movement to challenge the Indian batting lineup. Having played nine Tests in 2024, Woakes' experience and skill are vital to the team's success. Despite his understated nature, Woakes will likely take on the role of senior bowler and make key decisions, such as choosing the ball at Headingley. </p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his return to the major league mound for the first time since August 2023, pitching one inning and driving in two runs in the Los Angeles Dodgers' victory over the San Diego Padres. Ohtani allowed a run in his outing, with his fastball reaching 100 miles per hour. He also contributed offensively, going 2-for-4 with a run-scoring double and an RBI single. Ohtani's return was initially expected after the All-Star break, but it came sooner due to the team's injured pitchers. The game was a great team win, with the bullpen limiting the Padres to four hits over eight innings. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed between the two countries last month. The order allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The deal also removes tariffs on certain aerospace products, with the UK government continuing to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that directives from the Trump administration that led to the cancellation of several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were "void" and "illegal." The judge stated that the cancellations, which affected studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law. The judge ordered the NIH to restore the terminated grants. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has stated it will explore legal options, while plaintiffs like Dr. Brittany Charlton expressed relief and hope following the ruling. </p>
