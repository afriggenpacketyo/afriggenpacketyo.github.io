          <h2>Nissan Considers Closing Two Plants in Restructuring Effort</h2>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans following a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants in question are the Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which together account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The closures are being considered due to lower operating rates at these facilities, though Nissan has stated that the news is speculative and no official decision has been made yet. The company also plans to shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally by fiscal 2027.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, used for weight loss and diabetes, may have mental health implications, with studies showing potential links to anxiety and depression. A recent study suggested that mood changes were related to genetic variations, indicating that behavioral changes are likely not a direct result of the medications. Doctors suggest that individuals with obesity or type 2 diabetes are often already depressed, and the medications may improve mood as weight loss and blood sugar stabilize. It is important for doctors prescribing these drugs to be aware of the patient's history and for patients to communicate any mood changes to their healthcare providers.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's current budget reconciliation efforts and Ronald Reagan's "Reaganomics" in 1981, highlighting the use of budget reconciliation to enact sweeping policy changes. Both presidents aimed to quickly implement their agendas, featuring tax cuts and increased military spending. Reagan's program promised economic stimulus through tax cuts, while Trump's plan includes tax and spending cuts alongside a Pentagon boost. The article also notes the presence of an unelected official wielding significant power, drawing a comparison between David Stockman in Reagan's administration and Elon Musk in Trump's, who runs the Department of Government Efficiency initiative.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the growing disparity between the rich and the average person, arguing that the term "rich list" fails to capture the extent of extreme wealth. It proposes the idea of an "extreme wealth line" to curb the excesses of wealth inequality. The author suggests that there is a point at which wealth gives an individual too much power to shape politics and cause environmental harm, undermining economic competition and tearing at the social fabric. They call for a democratic way of defining an extreme wealth line to give politicians the mandate to tackle inequality before it is too late.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from Asia, dating back 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study highlights that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, allowing them to study patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation. The study found that after arriving in South America, the early settlers split into distinct groups, each becoming isolated in different environments, leading to unique genetic traits and adaptations.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang under a wartime law. The ruling indicated that a majority of the justices were skeptical of whether the migrants had been afforded enough due process protections. The case has been sent back to an appeals court to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The justices called for the lower court to consider how much notice the government should be required to provide migrants so they have an opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p>
