          <p>President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration will unilaterally send out letters in "about a week and a half (or) two weeks" to many countries informing them what their trade deals would look like. Trump made the remarks when asked which country he expects to clinch a trade agreement with next. He also said the administration is engaging with Japan and South Korea to strike quick trade deals. The administration's actions indicate a proactive approach to shaping international trade relationships. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from 86-million-year-old skeletons found in Mongolia, which is considered the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery reveals an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. Khankhuuluu, weighing approximately 750kg, represents a transitional fossil with features that contributed to the tyrannosaurs' powerful jaws and bite force. The species' identification has helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree, providing new insights into the evolution of these apex predators. </p>

Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war.
