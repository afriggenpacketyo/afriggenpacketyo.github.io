Army Secretary Dan Driscoll praised their bravery, stating they "ran at and tackled an armed person who they knew was actively shooting their buddies." Six soldiers have been awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for their actions, which surgeons said saved lives by stopping bleeding before medical teams arrived. The suspect, a sergeant, is in custody as the Army's Criminal Investigative Division investigates the incident.</p>

          <p>On prediction markets, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has emerged as the new favorite to become the next Fed chair, with his probability crossing 50% on Kalshi. This surge followed reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts. Waller, a Trump appointee, recently dissented from the Fed's decision to hold rates steady, a dovish stance that could be seen as favorable to investors and the administration's goals for lower interest rates.

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to broaden investment options for Americans within their defined contribution plans, which are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The order is considered a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has long pushed for greater access to the trillions of dollars held in U.S. retirement accounts.

          <p>In light of a new executive order promoting alternative assets in retirement plans, cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining attention as a way for long-term investors to access the asset class. These funds, which have seen record inflows this year, offer exposure to digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without requiring investors to directly manage a crypto wallet. Financial experts advise that while these ETFs offer convenience, investors should be cautious to distinguish between standard funds and riskier leveraged products designed for short-term trading.
