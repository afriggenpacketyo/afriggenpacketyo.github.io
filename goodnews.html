          <p>Macy's shares experienced a significant surge after the retailer announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts, attributing the positive results to revamped stores enhancing sales trends. The company has revised its full-year earnings and sales guidance upward, expressing cautious optimism about the future despite acknowledging the impact of tariffs. CEO Tony Spring emphasized the company's strategic positioning to gain market share and deliver improved customer experiences, noting the resilience of consumers and their continued spending on new fashion items. Macy's is also exploring further price adjustments due to tariffs while striving to maintain competitiveness with their business model. The company saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters. Optimism surrounds the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared together at a military parade in Beijing, signaling a united front against perceived US-led imperialism. Analysts suggest that while the leaders share a common dislike for the US and Western values, their alliance is primarily one of convenience, driven by individual policy priorities. Kim seeks to diversify his country's reliance on China by strengthening ties with Russia, which has led to economic benefits for North Korea, as its economy expanded by 3.7% in 2024. Some experts believe this meeting could lead to improved trade relations and economic cooperation, as China may offer North Korea more assistance through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock value increased as investors reacted positively to the outcome of Google's antitrust case, which avoided a proposed breakup of the tech giant. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the ruling did not require the company to divest Chrome or cease payments to companies for preloading its products. This outcome is viewed as a significant win for both Google and Apple, as Google can continue paying Apple to remain the default search engine on iPhones. Analysts are increasingly optimistic about the long-term durability of Google's search business and have raised their estimates accordingly, noting Google's efforts to compete with emerging AI search technologies.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential candidate for Fed chair, expressed his support for initiating a rate-cutting cycle, emphasizing the need to act proactively given the potential for rapid deterioration in the labor market. Waller believes that interest rates are currently above their neutral level and suggests multiple rate cuts could be implemented over the next few months, with the pace adjusted based on incoming data. While acknowledging the potential impact of tariffs on consumer prices and economic growth, Waller does not foresee a recession in his economic forecast. He also reiterated the importance of the Fed's independence and assured that the central bank will maintain its apolitical stance regardless of leadership changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which allowed members to share free shipping benefits with individuals outside their household, effective October 1. The company is transitioning users to Amazon Family, which permits Prime members to share benefits with one other adult, four children, and up to four teens within the same primary residential address. This change comes as reports indicate that Prime sign-ups in the U.S. leading up to Prime Day fell short of expectations, although Amazon maintains that Prime membership continues to show strong growth. Starting next month, those who do not live with the account holder will need to sign up for their own Prime membership.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock performance has lagged behind competitors like Oracle, prompting investors to seek clarity on Marc Benioff's plans to revitalize growth, as sales growth has been mired in the single digits. Investors are closely monitoring the company's progress in artificial intelligence, particularly its Agentforce system for customer support, and hoping that customers will pay more for Agentforce than for Service Cloud. Salesforce is also working to improve its current remaining performance obligations at constant currency, with analysts expecting revenue growth to pick up slightly in the fiscal third quarter. Activist investors, including Starboard Value, are pushing for a more favorable mix of sales and profit, while Salesforce has responded by expanding margins sooner than planned.</p>

          <p>As of September 3, 2025, the price of gold is $3,559.95 per ounce, with prices subject to fluctuations due to various factors, including supply and demand, economic conditions, and inflation. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, with investors turning to it as a hedge against inflation. Interest rates, geopolitical events, currency movements, and central bank policies also play a significant role in determining gold prices. Investor sentiment and speculative trading can cause sudden and substantial price swings in the gold market, influencing the overall value of the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A theft charge against a man accused of stealing flowers from tributes left to Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham has been dropped after a court was informed that a security guard had granted him permission to take the flowers. Parviz Jafari, the accused, appeared in court where the matter was withdrawn due to a lack of evidence proving dishonesty. The floral tributes had been left in Broad Street, Birmingham, following Osbourne's death, with thousands of fans paying their respects at the Black Sabbath Bridge. Osbourne, known as a pioneer of heavy metal music, passed away at the age of 76.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, attended by Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, was interpreted as a display of China's growing influence and a challenge to the US-led world order. The gathering of these leaders, particularly Putin and Kim, was seen as a deliberate message to the United States, showcasing China's ability to unite nations against Western dominance. The parade featured advanced weaponry, signaling China's ambition to rival the West militarily, but the parade also highlighted domestic challenges, including economic concerns and social issues. Despite these challenges, the parade served to bolster national pride and demonstrate China's commitment to global leadership.</p>

The plan costs $35 a month for unlimited 5G data, talk, and text on the AT&T network, activated in-app without credit checks or activation fees. This move aligns with OnePay's strategy to become a one-stop shop for its users, offering services like credit and debit cards, savings accounts, buy now, pay later loans, and a digital wallet. The partnership aims to lower AT&T's customer acquisition costs, allowing for savings to be passed on to end users, and is the latest example of a fintech firm adding wireless connectivity to its product set.</p>

          <p>Proposed changes to the County Championship may be delayed until 2027, or potentially shelved altogether, due to a lack of consensus among the 18 first-class counties. While a reduction to the T20 Blast was agreed upon, reaching an agreement on the future of the Championship has proven more challenging. Various proposals to reduce the current 14 matches to a 12-game program were supported by the Professional Cricketers' Association, but faced opposition from several counties. The choice now lies between maintaining 14 matches or reducing to 13, with the possibility of delaying any changes until 2027.</p>

Williams has effectively kicked off the festivities on Arthur Ashe Stadium, and has continued to show up at tournaments and partnering with any top player who’ll have her, much like Martina Navratilova towards the end of her career. The real satisfaction in watching her now comes not in seeing if she can turn back time, but in how much longer she can stretch it.</p>
