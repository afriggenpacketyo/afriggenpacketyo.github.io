Proposals include a two-hour cap on the use of individual social media apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said he was looking at the "addictive nature of some of the apps and smartphones". The government's plans to toughen online safety laws have been delayed because legislation passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023 has yet to be enacted.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for arguments in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone or attitude is a major issue as it signals contempt, a strong predictor of divorce. Arguments about family often stem from feeling unsupported, while chore disputes reflect an uneven distribution of labor and lack of acknowledgement. Ineffective communication styles can quickly derail conversations and lead to escalating conflicts.</p>
