          <p>The Trump administration is highlighting its efforts to improve the Social Security program on its 90th anniversary, emphasizing new provisions aimed at eliminating taxes on benefits for most seniors. A presidential proclamation frames the move as the largest tax break for seniors in U.S. history, part of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' Act. The administration also points to improved customer service, such as reduced telephone wait times, and efforts to combat fraud as evidence of its commitment to strengthening the program. These claims are presented amid criticism from Democrats regarding the administration's overall impact on the vital safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an $8 billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison and his leadership team have detailed their plan to revitalize the media company. The strategy involves significantly increasing film production to 15-20 movies annually, with a strong focus on major intellectual properties like “Top Gun,” “Star Trek,” and “Transformers.” The executives emphasized their commitment to making films for theatrical release rather than for streaming, aiming to restore Paramount's status as a top destination for talent. They also stated a goal to move the company away from political divisions to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move effectively strips conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of control over his company, including its brand name, studio, and property. The receiver has the authority to seize all assets, which could pave the way for their sale within weeks or months. This development shifts the long-running legal battle from federal bankruptcy court to state court, where attorneys for the families believe they have a better chance of holding Jones accountable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study conducted in Sweden suggests that medication for ADHD can significantly reduce the risks of other negative life outcomes. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that taking ADHD medication was associated with first-time reductions in substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. The findings provide evidence of wider, long-term benefits beyond managing core symptoms like impulsivity and inattention. Researchers believe this information could help patients make more informed decisions about starting medication, weighing the benefits against potential side effects.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs targeting China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean companies are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. Analysts suggest this strategic shift allows Korean firms to overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and high costs, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against China. For example, HD Hyundai is investing $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. This move highlights how geopolitical trade policies are reshaping global supply chains and investment flows in the maritime industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tottenham Hotspur Shows Promising Signs Under New Manager Despite Super Cup Defeat</h2>

          <p>Despite a heartbreaking loss to Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup, Tottenham Hotspur showed encouraging signs under new manager Thomas Frank. The team led 2-0 until the final minutes before a late comeback and a penalty shootout loss. For most of the match, Frank's tactical influence was evident in the team's pragmatic 3-5-2 formation, emphasis on set-pieces, and disciplined pressure. While the late collapse indicates there is still work to be done, the performance against the European champions suggests a solid foundation is being built, moving away from the high-risk style of the previous manager.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the media revolution shifting trust from traditional institutions to individual online creators, creating a challenging environment for credible information. The author, an independent journalist, argues that while misinformation thrives, a cohort of "evidence-based creators" is working to provide factual, nuanced content but lacks the necessary support infrastructure. The piece proposes creating new systems, such as an independent certification for journalistic standards and shared professional frameworks for creators. It suggests that legacy media should partner with these new voices rather than viewing them as a threat to navigate the new digital reality.</p>

          <p>Temporary flood barriers have successfully protected Alaska's capital, Juneau, from what could have been catastrophic damage after a record-breaking glacial outburst flood. Water levels in the Mendenhall River reached an unprecedented 16.65 feet as a glacial-dammed lake released a massive volume of water. The newly installed "Hesco" barriers held back the surge, preventing the widespread flooding of hundreds of homes that occurred in previous years. While some minor flooding and seepage occurred, officials said the mitigation efforts worked as intended, averting a major disaster for the community.</p>
