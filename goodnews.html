        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Transportation has officially abandoned a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from the airline industry, which argued it would increase ticket prices. The department stated it will now reconsider extra-statutory requirements while still implementing consumer protections mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds. This decision aligns with a broader effort to review regulations deemed overly burdensome on carrier operations.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after serving nearly three decades for a 1998 murder he did not commit. A judge vacated his conviction after a key trial witness, who had implicated him, recently recanted her testimony and confessed to the crime herself. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release, acknowledging that Hooper was an innocent man and that the conviction was tainted by false evidence. Hooper has now reunited with his family, while the case of the 77-year-old victim, Ann Prazniak, will be returned to police for further investigation.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, suggested that businesses may be hesitant to adopt agentic AI-powered browsers due to security concerns. In an interview, he argued that unless these autonomous browsers have robust controls for credentials and enterprise security, they are unlikely to be permitted in corporate environments within the next two years. While acknowledging their potential for consumers, Arora noted that the autonomy of AI agents is fundamentally at odds with enterprise security protocols. His comments came as he discussed his company's planned acquisition of identity security provider CyberArk to combat credential theft.</p>

          <h2>Author Arundhati Roy Releases Memoir Exploring Complex Relationship with Her Mother</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 18:47:37 EDT</div>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has published a new memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," detailing her turbulent and complex relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book offers a raw portrayal of Mary Roy, a feminist icon and educator in India, whom her daughter describes as both "my shelter and my storm." Rather than a traditional biography, the memoir functions as a "reportage of the heart," exploring the profound and often bruising bond that shaped Arundhati Roy as a person and a writer. It delves into a childhood where survival was key, and a relationship she likens to one between two nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump hosted a meeting with top technology executives, including the CEOs of Google and IBM, to launch a task force focused on integrating artificial intelligence into K-12 education. The event, part of a "Presidential AI Challenge," framed AI as a transformative tool for progress that will reshape society. While the First Lady and tech leaders touted the benefits of AI for students, the initiative drew criticism from watchdog groups. Critics raised concerns about promoting a technology linked to youth mental health issues and argued it provides political cover for tech companies facing public and legal scrutiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a strategic move based on financial mathematics. Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the salary cap space saved by the trade, combined with the value of the draft picks received, would allow the Cowboys to sign approximately five top-tier players. He emphasized that the trade was not personal but an opportunity to distribute compensation more broadly across the roster.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock rose significantly after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and provided a strong forecast, driven by its booming artificial intelligence business. A key factor in the positive outlook was the announcement of a new $10 billion order for its custom AI chips from a fourth, unnamed major customer. This development has bolstered investor confidence in Broadcom's ability to compete with Nvidia in the lucrative AI hardware market, with the company's AI-related revenue jumping 63% during the quarter to $5.2 billion.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has introduced a measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a temperature of 82 degrees or below. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, particularly for vulnerable populations, as sustained indoor heat is linked to serious health problems. The measure provides flexibility for small landlords and does not explicitly mandate air conditioning.</p>

Analysts note her approach is less about traditional maternal advocacy and more about engaging with business and legislative solutions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity at record highs and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, homeowners may be considering a home equity loan. However, it is crucial to ask strategic questions before borrowing against one's property to avoid the risk of foreclosure. Homeowners should first accurately determine their available equity, assess the urgency of their financial needs, and weigh the benefits of borrowing now versus waiting for potentially lower rates later. It's also important to compare the fixed rates of a loan with the variable, potentially volatile rates of a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with significant funds, such as $10,000, should act strategically to lock in current high certificate of deposit (CD) rates. Experts advise savers to consider depositing more money if possible to maximize returns before rates fall, or ensuring the amount is not too large for their liquidity needs. It is also recommended to shop directly with online banks, which typically offer higher rates, and to act quickly, as banks may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's official announcement.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has ended his nearly 25-year tenure at the helm of Tottenham Hotspur. Sources indicate the decision was made by the club's ownership, who believe a change in leadership is necessary for greater success on the field. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and the club's transformation into a global brand, though he often faced criticism from fans over a perceived lack of on-pitch investment and a long trophy drought. The club's ownership structure will remain unchanged.</p>

Further decreases are possible, contingent on the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cuts and cooling Treasury yields. While rates are not at the record lows seen a few years ago, the downward trend signals a more favorable borrowing environment is emerging. (not investment advice)</p>
