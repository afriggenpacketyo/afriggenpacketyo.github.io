          <p>Clayton Kershaw, one of the most dominant pitchers of his generation, has announced he will retire from baseball at the conclusion of his 18th season. The 37-year-old has spent his entire illustrious career with the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning three Cy Young awards, an MVP title, and a World Series championship in 2020. Dodgers owner Mark Walter praised Kershaw's legendary career and confirmed his status as a future Hall of Famer. While his final regular-season home start is scheduled, he is expected to play a role on the team's postseason roster, though his specific role remains undecided.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to 'call out the military' to control the country's borders, warning that illegal migration could destroy the nation from within. The two leaders held a press conference where they mostly avoided major disagreements, though Trump noted the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state was a point of contention. Starmer's government has focused on building a close relationship with Trump, which has reportedly helped secure significant investment promises from U.S. companies. The visit also saw Trump comment on Ukraine, expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, for engaging in 'illegal' ticket resale tactics. The lawsuit alleges the companies collaborated with scalpers to unlawfully purchase tickets, artificially inflating prices and harming consumers. The FTC claims Ticketmaster employs a 'bait and switch' approach to pricing and 'triple dips' by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets. The agency, which states Ticketmaster controls roughly 80% of major venue ticketing, is seeking an injunction to halt these practices.</p>

          <p>Leading chipmaker Nvidia has announced a plan to invest $5 billion in Intel and collaborate on developing custom data center and personal computer products. This partnership provides a significant boost to Intel, which has struggled financially after missing the shift to mobile and AI computing. The collaboration will combine Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing technology with Intel's CPUs, aiming to create a foundation for the next era of computing. The move follows the Trump administration's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel, signaling a concerted effort to revitalize the American semiconductor pioneer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new pill version of the popular weight-loss drug Wegovy may soon be available after trials showed it is nearly as effective as the injectable form. Drugmaker Novo Nordisk announced that participants who were obese or overweight lost an average of 16.6% of their body weight over 64 weeks on the once-daily oral medication. This result is comparable to the weight loss seen with Wegovy injections, potentially making the treatment more accessible for patients who dislike needles. The company has submitted the pill for FDA approval, with a decision expected by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK, marked by royal pageantry and meetings with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, highlighted a warm personal relationship but also the limits of British influence on U.S. policy. While the visit was smooth and avoided major public disagreements, Trump's chief of staff stated it would not alter his positions on key issues like trade and tariffs. The two leaders discussed Gaza and Ukraine, but maintained their existing stances. The trip appears to have solidified a dynamic where Starmer can respectfully disagree with Trump without facing diplomatic penalties, a success in itself for the UK government.</p>

The statement came as Meta revealed its new $799 Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband, allowing users to record video and send messages. This launch signals Meta's deepening investment in wearable technology as it faces growing competition from companies like Google, Snap, and reportedly Apple in the emerging smart glasses market.</p>

The verdict is a significant setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense accused immigration officials of lying about the incident. Witness footage, which did not show an assault by the protester, contradicted the prosecution's claims and showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito. The trial also highlighted factual discrepancies in DHS reports and brought scrutiny upon the credibility of a key border patrol chief who testified in the case.</p>

For a $50,000 home equity loan, the monthly payment on a 15-year term is now approximately $487, down from about $493 at the beginning of 2025. A 10-year term would cost around $618 per month.

          <p>American higher education has long been torn between three competing functions: providing cultural formation, preparing students for careers, and advancing academic research. This tension dates back to the late 19th century, when figures like Harvard President Charles W. Eliot pushed to transform classical colleges into practical universities focused on career readiness. This shift away from a purely cultural and classical curriculum was met with resistance but ultimately led to the modern research university model. The article suggests that the debate over the 'return on investment' of a college degree shows this fundamental conflict has never been resolved.</p>
