          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border. Chief US magistrate judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged with trespassing. The immigrants still face charges for crossing the border illegally, but the ruling is a setback for Trump administration efforts to raise penalties for unlawful crossings into the US. Defense attorneys argued that warning signs in the area were inadequate to inform immigrants they were committing a crime, a position Wormuth agreed with.</p>

Together, the two retailers will have to wade the choppy waters of new tariffs on imports, including footwear.

          <p>Disneyland‚Äôs new ‚ÄúWorld of Color‚Äù show, themed around ‚ÄúInside Out,‚Äù has received mixed reactions, with some finding its focus on happiness overly simplistic. The show, part of Disneyland's 70th-anniversary celebration, features characters from ‚ÄúInside Out‚Äù on a quest to discover what makes everyone happy. While the show is energetic, some critics found it lacking in sentimentality and depth, wishing it explored a wider range of emotions. The pre-show, featuring the Muppets, was more widely praised for its comedic and charming approach to safety instructions.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers in Denver experienced a two-minute communications outage due to multiple radio transmitter failures, impacting pilots flying into Denver International Airport.
