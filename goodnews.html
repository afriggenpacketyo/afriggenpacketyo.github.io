          <p>In 2025, homeowners can strategically use home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) for financing home projects, taking advantage of affordable price changes, and seeking the cheapest home equity borrowing options. Interest paid on HELOCs is tax-deductible when used for eligible home renovations, making it an attractive option for kitchen or bathroom remodels. HELOCs currently offer lower interest rates compared to home equity loans, cash-out refinances, personal loans, and credit cards. However, homeowners should carefully consider their financial health and ability to manage variable interest rates before pursuing a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has temporarily lowered tariffs on Chinese products, a move that follows trade talks in Geneva and aims to de-escalate trade tensions. Tariffs on Chinese goods will decrease to a minimum of 30 percent, down from 145 percent, while China will reduce its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. Despite the reduction, uncertainty remains for U.S. firms, and the two governments have until mid-August to reach a trade deal. If an agreement isn't reached, tariffs could rise again, though not to previous highs.</p>

The U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, and China committed to reducing tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. The move marks a rollback of tariffs initiated by President Trump, with experts noting the previous set of tariffs threatened price surges and a possible U.S. recession.</p>
