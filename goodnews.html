          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has appointed former biotech executive George Tidmarsh as its new director for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This move comes amid significant upheaval at the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has pursued staff cuts and expressed vaccine skepticism. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background and previous hardline regulatory stances are seen by some as a potential stabilizing force for the pharmaceutical industry. His appointment is expected to influence key FDA policies, including the controversial accelerated approval process for new drugs.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group, allowing the All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site to move forward. The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. Opponents argued the development was unlawful as the land was protected, but the judge ruled the planning decision was rationally exercised. While the club celebrated the victory, the campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, has indicated it may appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>As gold prices hover around $3,300 per ounce, market experts are divided on whether the precious metal can reach the $3,500 threshold by the end of July. Some analysts believe it's unlikely without a Federal Reserve interest rate cut or a major new economic headwind, citing the short timeframe and recent price consolidation. Others note that a significant catalyst, such as a shift in trade policy, could trigger a rapid price surge. Key factors influencing gold's trajectory include central bank purchasing activity, geopolitical events, inflation data, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave climbed over 7% after the company announced plans for a $1.5 billion bond sale.

This follows a previous successful debt offering and a major data center project announcement that have fueled the company's stock growth. Despite the positive market reaction, some investors remain concerned about CoreWeave's increasing debt load and the long-term sustainability of demand for its services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Eastern European Women's Football Has Not Kept Pace with West</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, nations in the eastern part of the continent have struggled to achieve comparable success. This article examines the reasons for this disparity, pointing to a combination of cultural norms that view football as a "man's game," a lack of investment, and the historical legacy of post-communist economic struggles. While UEFA initiatives are beginning to show results and participation is growing, experts argue that societal shifts and greater financial support for infrastructure and professionalization are needed for the region to catch up with its western counterparts.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has warned that the future of public service broadcasting is under serious threat and has urged YouTube to help address the issue. The regulator found that children spend far more time on YouTube than on all public service channels combined, risking a future disconnect from culturally relevant and trusted UK content. Ofcom recommended that broadcasters work with YouTube to make their content more prominent on the platform, particularly news and children's programming. The watchdog also suggested the government should consider legislation to enforce this.</p>

          <p>Kenyan authorities have dropped terrorism charges against activist Boniface Mwangi, instead charging him with lesser offenses including unlawful possession of ammunition. Mwangi was arrested in connection with recent anti-government street protests that turned violent. His supporters had feared he would face the more serious terrorism charge, which he denied. Mwangi, a well-known anti-corruption campaigner, was freed on bond after his court appearance and told supporters that the government was scared of young people organizing to demand better conditions.</p>

The United States' share also increased, though it remained smaller at 11%. This data reflects shifting trade dynamics for a strategic resource amid global economic pressures and geopolitical tensions, following a significant drop in China's overall magnet exports in April and May.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its iconic, half-century-old open seating policy, announcing that it will transition to assigned seats on January 27. This major shift is part of a broader overhaul of the airline's business model, which also includes new fare types and bag fees, aimed at boosting revenue. The carrier has designed a new eight-group boarding process based on elite status, fare class, and seat location to replace its current A-B-C system. The move marks a fundamental change for the airline as it seeks to align more closely with its industry rivals.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the quirky but relevant question of whether pets need sunscreen. Veterinarians and zookeepers explain that animals, especially those with light-colored or sparse fur like certain dog breeds, pigs, and even elephants, can suffer from sunburns and develop skin cancer. While the idea may seem strange to many pet owners, experts recommend applying sunscreen as a preventative measure. The piece discusses the challenges of application, the types of products to use, and how selective breeding has created domestic animals that are more vulnerable to sun damage than their wild ancestors.</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record for the depth of uranium exploration, successfully discovering a sandstone-type uranium deposit at over 3,000 meters. This achievement is significant as this type of deposit is typically larger and cheaper to mine, and it reflects major advances in China's resource exploration technology. The discovery is strategically important for the country, which is a major consumer of uranium for its nuclear power and weapons programs but remains heavily dependent on foreign imports for the critical fuel.</p>
