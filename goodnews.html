          <h2>UK Energy Bills Expected to Decrease in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 06:31:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts that annual energy bills in the UK will decrease by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This nearly 7% decrease would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit down to ¬£1,720 from the current ¬£1,849. While this fall offers some relief, energy prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, raising concerns about affordability for many households. The price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales, and Scotland, and is updated every three months by Ofgem, based on typical household energy usage.</p>
