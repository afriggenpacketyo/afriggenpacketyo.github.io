          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, with their three children. This move is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" for the family following a challenging period that included Catherine's cancer diagnosis and treatment. Sources indicate they view Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home," where they intend to live even after Prince William becomes King. The couple will fund the move and any renovations privately, paying market rent for the property and continuing their focus on maintaining a private family life without live-in staff.</p>

She achieved this milestone just four weeks after undergoing heart surgery, demonstrating remarkable resilience and determination. Chambers, who began her Parkrun journey in 2016 after recovering from a previous surgery, has become a beloved local figure and an inspiration to her community. Despite her achievements, including being cheered on by Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes, she remains humble, hoping her story encourages others to start running.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters, developed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyards. These units, which can be constructed in just one week, provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to the affordable housing crisis. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex made from shipping containers, aimed at providing housing for low-income and unhoused senior citizens.</p>

          <p>Millions of AT&T customers affected by two major data breaches in 2024 can now file claims as part of a proposed $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches exposed sensitive information, including Social Security numbers and call records, for a vast number of current and former account holders. Eligible individuals, who are being notified via email, can file for compensation of up to $7,500 for documented losses traceable to the incidents. The deadline to submit a claim is November 18, 2025, though the settlement requires final court approval at a hearing scheduled for December 3, 2025.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, a dominant private healthcare software company based in Wisconsin. Faulkner has built a $5.7 billion enterprise by rejecting conventional business practices, such as going public or making acquisitions, and maintaining a unique, quirky corporate culture on a sprawling, themed campus. Despite criticism over her software's user experience, she is widely respected by customers for her accessibility and commitment. Faulkner has pledged to donate 99% of her wealth to charity and has established a complex trust to ensure Epic remains privately held after her death.</p>

          <h2>Immigration Arrests Declined in July Amidst Activist Efforts and Logistical Hurdles</h2>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests saw a 13% decrease in July compared to June, a slowdown in the Trump administration's promised deportation efforts. While ICE officials cite the need for more resources, activists believe their resistance tactics are having an effect. In Oregon, for example, a "rapid response" hotline run by non-profits helps connect arrestees with legal aid, sometimes filing habeas corpus petitions before they can be transported to out-of-state detention facilities. The state's "sanctuary" law, which limits cooperation between local and federal authorities, further complicates ICE operations, contributing to lower arrest numbers in the region.</p>

          <p>At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics. Thompson clocked a swift 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second with a time of 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year prior. Despite the head-to-head victory, Thompson downplayed its significance, stating he primarily competes against himself, while Lyles viewed his performance as a positive step toward the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area south of Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the intense force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol then conducted a hoist rescue, and Wardwell was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to intensify its efforts in developing space-based solar power technology to compete with the United States. This technology involves placing large solar power facilities in orbit to convert solar energy into electricity, which is then transmitted to Earth via microwaves or lasers. Unlike ground-based solar plants, space stations offer a continuous and more intense source of energy, unaffected by weather or nighttime. The academic argued that China's current research, led by universities, lacks the capacity for such a complex systems project and requires a more centralized, top-down national strategy.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping to equip former foster youth in California with the essential supplies they need to start college. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware that dorm rooms are typically unfurnished beyond basic furniture. The organization hosts an annual event where students can pick out bedding, towels, and other necessities, helping to level the playing field and reduce the stigma they might feel compared to peers who arrive with family support. The program, which started with a small Amazon wishlist, now serves over 140 students, providing them with a sense of ownership and preparedness.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's share declined. This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which are gaining traction and positive attention for their durability and new form factors. While Apple still leads the market, its lack of design innovation in recent years has created an opening for competitors. Analysts predict Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete with Samsung's growing influence and higher-priced premium devices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Shares Three Steps to Cultivate Greater Emotional Endurance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to build emotional endurance, which is the ability to manage stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. First, she advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-uncomfortable space between not knowing and knowing. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe struggles as part of the process rather than a sign of failure. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body that it can tolerate discomfort and build resilience.</p>
