          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:42:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A fierce competition for top-tier artificial intelligence talent is underway, with major tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google offering massive compensation packages to lure experts away from startups. Meta has been particularly aggressive, reportedly offering multi-million dollar deals and investing heavily in its new Meta Superintelligence Labs. This trend is causing a cultural shift in Silicon Valley, as large firms cherry-pick key individuals rather than acquiring entire startups, putting smaller companies at a disadvantage. The high demand and salaries reflect the strategic importance of AI, even as the technology's ultimate applications remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's five-day trip to Scotland culminated in the opening of a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, largely focused on promoting his family's business interests and playing golf, also included a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer where a framework for a US-EU trade deal was discussed. The trip has drawn attention for its use of the presidency to promote the Trump brand, with the new course being the third Trump Organization property in Scotland. During his visit, Trump reiterated his criticism of windmills, calling them "ugly monsters" that harm bird populations.</p>

          <h2>Bollywood Star Aamir Khan to Release New Film Directly on YouTube, Bypassing Streamers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:11:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a groundbreaking move for the Indian film industry, Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan will release his latest hit, “Sitaare Zameen Par,” exclusively on YouTube Movies-on-Demand. This strategy bypasses traditional subscription-based streaming platforms, making the film available for rent at an accessible price point to a global audience. Khan stated his goal is to reach the 97-98% of the population who don't see films in theaters, leveraging India's high internet penetration and digital payment adoption. This experiment in post-theatrical distribution could create a new blueprint for filmmakers, particularly for emerging talent seeking wider distribution without major studio deals.</p>

          <p>Jody Plauché, whose father Gary Plauché famously shot and killed his son's molester on live television in 1984, has revisited the traumatic case in a new interview. Now 53, Plauché says he advises parents against taking the law into their own hands, noting his father "got lucky" to avoid prison time, which would have deprived him of paternal support during his recovery. Plauché, who has written a memoir about his experience, recounts forgiving his father and now works as an advocate for survivors of sexual assault. He hopes his story provides understanding about the impact of such violence and gives hope to other survivors.</p>

          <h2>Perseid Meteor Shower to Peak in August, but a Bright Moon May Interfere</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the most popular celestial events of the year, is set to peak on the night of August 11-12. Known for producing as many as 100 meteors per hour, including bright fireballs, this year's viewing conditions will be hampered by a bright waning gibbous moon. The moon will be about 92% full, and its glare is expected to wash out many of the fainter meteors. Experts advise that dedicated stargazers should still try to watch from a dark location far from city lights, as the shower is known for producing larger, more spectacular fireballs that can remain visible.</p>

          <p>The Museum of Make Believe in Laguna Beach, a small, whimsical space created by partners Amy and Geoff Mitchell, has become an unexpected hit with all ages.

The founders see the nonprofit space as an intimate art gallery, where handcrafted art tells stories that tap into universal life experiences. The museum's appeal lies in its ability to be both cathartic and charming, reminding visitors of the enduring power of fables.</p>

          <h2>Startup Uses AI and Robotics to Automate Humane Japanese Fish-Handling Method</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An El Segundo-based startup, Shinkei Systems, is using AI-powered robotics to automate the traditional Japanese fish-handling technique known as ikejime. This method, which involves humanely killing fish to stop stress hormone production, is said to improve flavor, texture, and shelf life. The company's robot, Poseidon, makes the labor-intensive process scalable for commercial fishing, with the goal of making higher-quality, more humanely processed fish widely available. Having recently raised $22 million in funding, Shinkei provides its machines to fishermen and then sells the premium processed fish to high-end restaurants and retailers.</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has announced he will personally cover the educational expenses for 22 children who were orphaned during the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. The children are from the Poonch district in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, an area heavily affected by the cross-border shelling and drone attacks. According to the local Congress party unit, Gandhi will sponsor the children's education through their graduation. The move comes as he takes on a more prominent role as the leader of the opposition in India's lower house of parliament.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions has secured a new investment from tech giant Samsung as it prepares for a potential IPO. Rebellions, which merged with rival Sapeon last year, is positioning itself as a major domestic competitor to Nvidia, focusing on chips for AI inferencing. The company is currently in a funding round aiming to raise up to $200 million and is collaborating with Samsung's foundry business to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip. This partnership could be a strategic win for Samsung as it seeks to grow its chipmaking division and compete with industry leader TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Consumer Borrowing Rates Remain Stable Amid Federal Reserve's Unchanged Benchmark Rate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 05:30:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding its key short-term interest rate steady throughout 2025, consumer borrowing costs have seen little movement. The average rate for credit card balances has hovered around 20.1%, while auto loan rates have been similarly stable. Mortgage rates, which are more closely tied to 10-year Treasury yields, have fluctuated in a narrow band. While President Trump has argued for rate cuts to ease borrowing for consumers and businesses, experts note there is no guarantee a Fed cut would translate to lower rates for products like mortgages, which are influenced by broader economic factors.
