        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadcom's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by robust revenue and strong guidance for the upcoming period. The chipmaker reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 against an expected $1.56, with revenue reaching $15 billion, slightly above the $14.99 billion projection. Broadcom anticipates approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, exceeding the analysts' forecast of $15.70 billion. The company's net income saw a substantial increase to $4.97 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.12 billion, or 44 cents per share, in the previous year, fueled by AI revenue which reached $4.4 billion. Broadcom expects continued AI growth through fiscal year 2026, with projected AI chip sales of $5.1 billion in the third quarter. The strong performance is attributed to Broadcom's custom AI chips and networking parts for server clusters.</p>

Morgan Stanley analysts agree that AI agents expand the "surface area of IT to be protected." The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing adoption of AI agents.</p>
