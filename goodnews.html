          <p>A report from the China Finance 40 Forum, a prominent Beijing-based think tank, suggests that China's real consumption power has been significantly underestimated by mainstream economic metrics. The researchers argue that when properly assessed, China's per capita spending is much higher than official data indicates, potentially reaching 40-50% of levels in developed countries like Japan and Germany. This counter-consensus view proposes that traditional measurements fail to capture the full strength of the world's second-largest consumer market, offering a new perspective on its economic potential.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest point since April has triggered a significant increase in home loan refinancing. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance applications jumped 7% last week and are 40% higher than the same period last year, with a notable rise in conventional and VA applications. While existing homeowners are capitalizing on the lower rates to save money, the demand from new homebuyers remains stagnant, with purchase applications seeing almost no change. This suggests ongoing uncertainty is keeping potential buyers on the sidelines despite the more favorable borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

In a video message, he stated that only the trust he founded has the authority to identify his reincarnation, a process he insists must occur outside of China. The announcement was welcomed by his followers in Dharamshala, India, but was quickly rejected by Beijing. China's foreign ministry reiterated its stance that the next Dalai Lama must be found within China and approved by the government, highlighting the ongoing geopolitical tensions over Tibet.</p>

A Hamas official expressed readiness to agree if the deal ensures a complete end to the war, a long-standing demand.

While acknowledging China's role in regional development, he stressed that this should not interfere with relationships with traditional partners like Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists believe they have solved the puzzle of why Earth remained lethally hot for 5 million years after the "Great Dying" mass extinction 252 million years ago. An analysis of a vast fossil archive from China suggests the collapse of tropical forests was the key factor. The loss of vegetation crippled the planet's ability to absorb and store carbon through processes like silicate weathering, causing a super greenhouse effect that persisted long after the initial volcanic activity ceased. The findings highlight the critical role of forests as a climate buffer and serve as a stark warning about potential tipping points from modern deforestation and global warming.</p>

Dr. Kimberly Ammann of the Winged Freedom Raptor Hospital in Wisconsin used sterilized Atlantic cod skin, a material typically used on human wounds, to repair the eagle's leg, which was ripped open and deeply infected. After a 10-month rehabilitation, the eagle, named Kere, was successfully released back into the wild.

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaign provides a model for how to build popular support for climate policy by intrinsically linking it to cost-of-living issues. Rather than focusing on complex, technocratic schemes, Mamdani's platform includes tangible goals like a rent freeze and free bus transit, which have direct climate benefits by boosting density and public transit use. This approach, which supporters say learns from the political shortcomings of federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, aims to make climate action feel immediate and beneficial to working-class residents, thereby creating a stronger political base to defend green policies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a plan to spend nearly $425 million in funds collected from Measure ULA, the city's tax on high-value property sales. This is the largest spending plan to date for the controversial "mansion tax," which has been criticized by the real estate industry. The funds for the 2025 fiscal year are directed toward affordable housing and homelessness prevention, with over $100 million for tenant income support and eviction defense, and over $288 million for producing and preserving affordable housing units. Supporters hail it as a crucial source of funding for these programs.</p>

          <p>This opinion column analyzes the victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral primary, arguing that it has panicked Wall Street and establishment Democrats. The author draws parallels to Upton Sinclair's 1934 gubernatorial campaign in California, suggesting that Mamdani's platform, which focuses on affordability and challenges elite interests, speaks to a deep desire among voters for an alternative to the status quo. The piece contends that instead of resisting his message, the Democratic Party should see his success as a potential roadmap for regaining voter favor in future elections by rejecting austerity and embracing bold economic policies.</p>
