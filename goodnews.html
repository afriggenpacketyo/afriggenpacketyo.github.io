          <p>Ireland's women's rugby team has advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals after a high-scoring 43-27 victory against Spain. Despite a spirited performance from the Spanish side, which managed five tries, the Irish team secured a bonus point by halftime with seven tries of their own. Key performances from Anna McGann and Grace Moore, who both scored twice, were crucial in sealing the win. The victory ensures Ireland's progression in the tournament, though their celebration was tempered by an injury to co-captain Sam Monaghan, adding to their team's existing injury concerns.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer recounts her journey from a liberal, urban background to becoming a hunter in Montana, challenging the reflexive disdain for hunting often found on the political left. She argues that hunting is a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to factory farming, emphasizing the deep connection to nature and responsibility it fosters. The author describes the emotional gravity of taking an animal's life and the community she has found among other hunters who are conservationists and food-conscious individuals. The piece advocates for a more nuanced understanding of hunting, separating it from negative political stereotypes and gun culture debates.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin shares her personal story of resilience and reinvention after her husband died suddenly when she was 26. Believing she would not remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, who became her second husband and biggest supporter. Morin explains that her marriage to Hasty opened up new possibilities she had never imagined, encouraging her to leave her stable therapy job to become a full-time author and speaker. Together, they embraced a new life, which now includes living full-time on a sailboat, demonstrating how finding love again can lead to profound personal growth and unexpected adventures.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is portraying Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of Springsteen's stark 1982 album, "Nebraska." In an interview, White discussed the daunting task of playing the rock legend, particularly during a period when Springsteen was battling depression and alienation. He detailed his process of learning guitar and singing, and how he connected with the feelings of fraudulence and generational trauma that both Springsteen and his character Carmy in "The Bear" experience. The film, which has Springsteen's approval, offers an intimate look at a pivotal, vulnerable moment in the musician's career.</p>

          <h2>Dr. Sanjay Gupta Explores New Frontiers in Understanding and Treating Chronic Pain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:36:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta details advancements in chronic pain treatment, focusing on a method called "reverse translational research." This approach prioritizes the patient's lived experience, using it to guide lab-based science rather than the other way around. This has led to breakthroughs in identifying objective biomarkers for subjective pain by mapping unique neural signals in the brain. The article highlights how this research has enabled the use of deep brain stimulation to predict and intercept pain signals, offering a revolutionary, though not yet widely available, treatment that underscores the brain's central role in chronic pain.</p>

          <h2>Exhibition Highlights the Introduction of Surfing to the U.S. by Hawaiian Royalty in 1885</h2>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing on the U.S. mainland. The sport was first introduced in 1885 by three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were studying at a nearby military school. Using surfboards fashioned from local redwood trees, they demonstrated the royal Hawaiian tradition of "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. This act of cultural exchange planted the seed for what would become a major American sport, a history that is often overlooked but is now being celebrated.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is undergoing a significant strategic transformation from a consumer-focused research lab into a global enterprise business, spearheaded by Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap. Since the launch of ChatGPT Enterprise, the company has seen massive demand from businesses and is rapidly expanding its international presence with new offices in Brazil, Australia, and India. Lightcap has grown the company's go-to-market team from 50 to over 700 people to sell its powerful AI models directly to corporate clients. This expansion places OpenAI in a complex dynamic with its primary investor and cloud provider, Microsoft, as the two increasingly compete for enterprise customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of South Australia is banning the sale and distribution of the iconic fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of its ongoing fight against single-use plastics. The small plastic fish, a staple in many Asian takeaway restaurants, are difficult to process in recycling facilities due to their size and often end up as environmental pollutants. This new measure builds on previous legislation that has already banned items like plastic straws and carrier bags. While consumers can still get soy sauce in larger bottles or sachets, the ban targets a recognizable source of plastic waste.</p>

          <p>According to Federal Reserve data, the median retirement savings for American households aged 55 to 64 is approximately $185,000, a figure that experts suggest is insufficient for a comfortable retirement. A significant portion of older Americans have no retirement savings at all, highlighting a looming crisis. The article outlines several strategies for those behind on their savings goals, including working with a financial advisor to optimize investment strategies. It also discusses alternative assets like Gold IRAs and micro-investing apps that use spare change to help individuals bolster their nest eggs, even later in life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay delves into the common feeling of guilt or unease about experiencing personal happiness while the world is rife with suffering and political turmoil. Drawing on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling others' pain is a moral response. However, this empathy should extend to sharing in others' joys as well. The piece suggests that allowing oneself to feel both the world's horror and its delight is not a contradiction but a form of resistance against despair and a vital part of being a connected, resilient human being.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still claim the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, which is set to expire. According to the IRS, a buyer does not need to have physical possession of the vehicle by the September 30 deadline. Instead, a consumer can qualify by entering into a "written binding contract" and making a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before that date. This clarification provides a crucial grace period for individuals who have ordered an EV but are still awaiting its delivery from the dealer or manufacturer. (not investment advice)</p>

To achieve this, the team plans to implement a more physical running game, a hallmark of Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman. However, their strategy faces a major challenge with the season-ending knee injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater, placing Herbert's protection in the hands of a rookie. The season will be a critical test of whether Herbert can finally join the league's elite tier of quarterbacks.</p>
