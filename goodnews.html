          <p>Ferrari faces unique pressure in Italy due to its status as a national team, leading to intense media scrutiny and public opinion regarding its performance. Team principal Frederic Vasseur expressed frustration with reports questioning his position, stating that such journalism hurts the team's morale and ability to compete for championships. These reports appeared in two respected Italian newspapers, Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere della Sera, highlighting the team's underperformance relative to pre-season expectations. Vasseur acknowledged the responsibility for the team's current situation lies with him, yet remains upset that his staff is being indirectly linked with other teams due to the reports. </p>

          <p>Global equities experienced muted gains as investors digested Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alongside growing signs of fatigue toward Trump's policymaking. The MSCI World index saw a slight increase, while U.S. futures also edged higher, with Asian equities showing similar trends. Hugh Dive from Atlas Funds Management suggested that the markets are becoming jaded by Trump's policy changes, especially after the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The market's reaction reflects a potential desensitization to America's policymaking after previous tariff-related volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's upper house election is formally set for July 20, posing a test for Prime Minister Ishiba's minority government amid inflation and potential U.S. tariffs. Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, though Iran's foreign minister denied any such agreement. Japan is also experiencing a surge in whooping cough cases, with over 31,000 people infected this year, an eight-fold increase from 2024. Additionally, the U.S. has started imposing new tariffs on home appliance imports, while China plans to hold a military parade on Sept. 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. </p>

          <p>Western airlines face greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which is forcing carriers to avoid dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. While both Western and Chinese carriers are diverting flights, Western firms remain barred from Russian airspace, giving Chinese companies a competitive advantage. Analysts note that airfare and flight times are key factors for travelers, particularly from China, potentially widening the gap between Chinese airlines and their competitors. The closure of airspace over Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan has further complicated flight routes, with Western firms diverting through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, while Chinese airlines maintain more flexibility due to access to Russian airspace. </p>

          <p>Google may be compelled to make changes to its search services in the UK to foster greater competition, according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes from firms with excessive market power. Google dominates the UK search market with over 90% of searches and supports 200,000 businesses through search advertising. Google stated it would "work constructively" with the CMA but acknowledged that the announcement presents "clear challenges" to its UK operations. </p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years, seeking ¬£5.5 million for the 1,000-acre property which includes a ruined castle, a working farm, and holiday accommodations. The island has been a family home since 1945 when the Dowager Viscountess Selby purchased it after searching for an island following the war. Jim Gully, whose father was raised on the island, described an idyllic childhood spent exploring the white sand beaches and rocky coves. The castle on the island, built in 1911 by George Alexander MacLean Buckley, fell into ruin in the 1980s due to high upkeep costs. </p>

          <p>Taiwan's China Airlines is delaying the retirement of older aircraft due to delivery delays of Boeing 787-9 jets, which may lead to compensation payments from Boeing. The airline is undergoing a fleet renewal, splitting an order for new long-haul aircraft between Boeing and Airbus, including 24 Boeing 787s. Chairman George Kao stated that the delays are impacting the airline's plan to replace ageing Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s, and the airline will seek compensation from Boeing if the delays are Boeing's responsibility. The airline plans to add more capacity to routes like New York and London with the new fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, offering a potential alternative to traditional electronic chips amid US sanctions. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to advanced Nvidia GPUs. As traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, optical computing offers advantages such as ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption. The development of "Meteor-1" signifies progress in overcoming challenges in optical computing by expanding computational parallelism. </p>

U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, returning to levels below those seen before Israel's attack on Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, preventing any casualties.

The announcement follows a tumultuous day in the region, with Iran retaliating for a U.S. strike on its nuclear facilities.
