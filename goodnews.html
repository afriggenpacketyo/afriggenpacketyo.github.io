          <p>Bhoomi Chauhan, a business administration student, narrowly missed her Air India flight to London Gatwick by just 10 minutes due to heavy traffic. The flight, AI171, subsequently crashed shortly after takeoff, resulting in the deaths of 241 people on board and others on the ground. Airline staff denied Ms. Chauhan boarding due to her late arrival, leading to initial frustration. She later received a call informing her of the plane crash, which she described as a "miracle" for her. This is a story of a near miss with tragic consequences for hundreds of others. </p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a highly valued perk, are becoming increasingly rare as more companies adopt hybrid work schedules. Experts suggest that the rise of work-from-home Fridays has led to the phasing out of summer Fridays. Traffic data indicates fewer workers are commuting on Fridays compared to mid-week. Despite this trend, a survey reveals that summer Fridays remain the most valued summer benefit among employees, who believe it improves productivity and morale. The author's tone is informative and reflects on the changing work culture. </p>

          <p>Rare earth elements (REEs), a group of 17 chemical elements, are essential in many modern technological products, including smartphones, EVs, and defense technologies. These elements are critical for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines. China mines 70% of the world's rare earth elements, primarily from the Bayan Obi mine. The US and EU are building internal supplies of rare earth elements to reduce dependence on China. The strategic importance of REEs makes them valuable in both commerce and defense. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in the commercial extraction of rubidium directly from salt lake brine. This could potentially reduce dependence on imports, mainly from Canada. The industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, providing a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium is widely used in the electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace sectors. The author's tone is informative, highlighting the significance of this scientific advancement. </p>
