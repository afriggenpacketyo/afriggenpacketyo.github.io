          <p>Faced with water scarcity, population growth, and climate change, St. George, Utah, is investing over a billion dollars in a wastewater reclamation plant set to be completed by the end of 2025. The plant will treat sewage for use in irrigation, freeing up drinking water supplies, and eventually, the treated water will be directly integrated into the drinking water supply. This initiative aims to address the growing water shortfall in the Colorado River Basin, where cities are struggling with overuse and drought. The project mirrors successful wastewater reuse programs in larger cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles, offering a potential model for other drought-stricken communities in the American West.

          <p>As the federal government reduces its responsibilities, particularly in areas like disaster relief, public health, and consumer protection, states should pool their resources to compensate, according to legal experts Aziz Z. Huq and Jon D. Michaels. Interstate collaboration can involve setting up regional research consortia, recreating public-health forecasting centers, and mobilizing criminal task forces to combat corruption. This approach allows states to maintain essential services and attract residents and businesses by prioritizing health and safety. The authors argue that such collaboration can rebuild a national compact without the political strings attached to federal funding. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>
