BYD executives framed the divestment as a normal part of investing, noting Buffett's significant profit, having made "20 times the capital he invested." Despite this positive framing, BYD shares fell over 6% this week, following a recent cut to its 2025 sales target and its first quarterly profit decline in over three years, signaling cooling growth in the company.

Many of the museum's most iconic pieces are designated top national treasures, restricting their physical travel outside China. This forward-thinking approach aims to overcome logistical hurdles and allow a global audience to experience the unique cultural heritage of Sanxingdui, fostering international appreciation.

          <p>Iraq's Oil Ministry announced the resumption of oil exports to Turkey from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, ending a two-and-a-half-year deadlock that had frozen the flow of crude. The agreement, reached between Iraq's federal government, the Kurdistan regional government, and foreign oil producers, will see approximately 180,000-190,000 barrels per day flow to Turkey's Ceyhan port. This marks a significant step towards resolving a long-standing dispute over independent oil sales, which were previously deemed illegal by the International Chamber of Commerce. Operations have reportedly started smoothly, indicating a positive development for regional stability and economic cooperation.</p>

          <h2>UK Successfully Harvests First Experimental Rice Crop Amid Climate Change Trials</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 20:50:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown and harvested its first experimental rice crop in eastern England, with ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and local farmers leading the ambitious trial. This unexpected success, aided by the UK's hottest summer on record, aims to explore future food production and tackle climate change. By re-wetting peat soils, which typically release carbon dioxide when dry, growing rice could help lock in greenhouse gases, potentially cutting national emissions. This project represents a radical breakthrough in balancing farming with environmental concerns, offering a sustainable agricultural model for a changing climate and potentially bringing UK-grown rice to dinner plates within the next decade.</p>

          <h2>Indian Researchers Win Ig Nobel Prize for Study on Smelly Shoes and UV-C Rack Design</h2>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, won an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes affect the experience of using a shoe rack. Their inventive research, prompted by observations in university hostels, identified Kytococcus sedentarius bacteria as the culprit behind the odor. This led to the development of a prototype UV-C light-equipped shoe rack that effectively sterilizes footwear in minutes, eliminating the stink. The award, organized by the journal Annals of Improbable Research, celebrates their "silly but inventive" scientific endeavor, offering a practical solution to a universal domestic design problem.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 19:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly Model Y L has achieved stunning success in China, selling out through October with over 35,000 orders placed on launch day alone. This rapid demand is crucial for Tesla, which has faced slowing sales globally due to political factors and increased competition in European markets. By expanding cabin space and lowering prices, the Model Y L is broadening EV appeal in China, the world's largest EV market, thereby contributing to a significant reduction in transportation pollution. The EPA's report corroborates that EVs dramatically reduce heat-trapping gases, offering environmental and cost-saving benefits for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe established an overwhelming 11½-4½ lead over the USA going into the Ryder Cup singles, needing only 2.5 more points for retention, marking their largest ever pre-singles lead. The day at Bethpage Black was unfortunately marred by "thuggish" and personal insults from American fans towards European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to increased security. Despite the hostile atmosphere and a heated exchange between players, Europe's imperious performance has put them on the verge of a historic away victory, overshadowing the unsportsmanlike conduct from some sections of the galleries.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his new book "Life, Law, & Liberty," reflects on his 30 years as a "swing justice" and the court's ideological shift, stating, "The cases swung, not me." He expresses deep concern over the current antagonistic discourse and partisanship in America, even within court opinions, warning that "Democracy is not guaranteed to survive." Kennedy details his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion, influenced by personal realizations and a belief in interpreting "liberty" over time, diverging from originalist views. He also shares poignant anecdotes, including a reconciliation with Justice Scalia before his death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the efficacy of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, with consultant dermatologists expressing skepticism despite anecdotal evidence from users. While marine collagen peptides may have a better chance of absorption through the gut, the idea of them specifically targeting skin is questioned, and topical creams are deemed ineffective as collagen molecules are too large. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, but independent research finds little substantial effect. Experts conclude that robust evidence for oral and topical collagen is lacking, emphasizing that sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking have a far greater impact on skin health.</p>

          <p>Scotland's Anthony McGill secured his first ranking final in eight years at the British Open, triumphing 6-3 over compatriot and four-time world champion John Higgins. McGill, who had slipped to 57th in the world but reached his first semi-final in nearly three years, displayed steady play, winning four consecutive frames to seal his place against England's Shaun Murphy, who decisively beat defending champion Mark Selby 6-1. This significant victory marks a career turnaround for McGill, who is already guaranteed a return to the top 50, and he described it as the "biggest final of my career."</p>

          <p>St Helens snatched a sensational 16-14 Super League play-off eliminator victory against Leeds Rhinos with a final-play try from Shane Wright at a stunned Headingley. The dramatic come-from-behind win, sealed after the final hooter in an energy-sapping match, keeps Saints' hopes alive and sets up a semi-final trip to Hull KR. Leeds, despite leading for much of the game and playing against a St Helens side short-benched due to a player's wife going into labor, squandered numerous chances. St Helens completed a stunning late turnaround with a mesmerising 16-pass move, delivering one of the season's most frantic and decisive moments.</p>

          <p>Labour has pledged to begin constructing three new towns—Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London—before the next general election, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. This ambitious initiative, central to Labour's vision for economic growth, will be led by a New Towns Unit, tasked with attracting millions in public and private funding for essential infrastructure like GP surgeries, schools, and transport. The plan includes a recommendation for at least 40% affordable housing, echoing post-war government housing booms that aimed to provide "homes fit for heroes" and now "fit for families of all shapes and sizes."</p>
