        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion, many Americans are exploring debt forgiveness programs as a potential solution. These programs typically involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing balances by 30% to 50% before fees. However, this strategy is not suitable for everyone, as it can negatively impact credit scores and may result in the forgiven debt being considered taxable income. The article suggests this option is best for those with significant debt who are already behind on payments and have limited alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to broaden the availability of cryptocurrency within retirement plans, signaling a friendlier regulatory stance toward digital assets. This development comes as crypto ETFs, such as those for Bitcoin and Ethereum, see record inflows, offering investors a way to gain exposure without directly holding the currencies. The article discusses the growing interest in these investment vehicles for long-term portfolios, while also cautioning investors about the higher risks associated with leveraged crypto products, which are designed for short-term trading rather than stable, long-term holding.

          <p>Prediction markets now favor Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller as the most likely candidate to become the next Fed Chair, with his odds surging past 50% on the Kalshi platform. This significant shift occurred after reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's policy views, particularly his openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts. Waller's chances have now surpassed those of previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, signaling a potential new direction for the central bank's leadership.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global oil market is largely discounting President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy exports. Despite Trump setting a Friday deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine, oil prices have remained stable, suggesting that traders view the tariff threat primarily as a negotiation tactic rather than a firm policy. Analysts believe that if the tariffs were fully enacted against major importers like India and China, it would significantly disrupt global supply and cause prices to spike, an outcome the administration likely wants to avoid.

          <p>Shares of Duolingo surged more than 30% after the language-learning company significantly raised its full-year revenue and bookings forecast. The optimistic outlook is credited to a 40% jump in daily active users, which executives attribute to the successful integration of AI tools and the expansion of course offerings into new areas like chess. The company's strong performance and strategic acquisition of a music gaming startup signal its continued growth trajectory beyond its core language-learning platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The implementation of President Trump's widespread tariffs has created a "tricky" and volatile investment environment, according to market strategists. While many financial advisors recommend that long-term investors ignore the short-term market fluctuations, others suggest tactical opportunities exist. Sectors less dependent on the global trade of physical goods, such as financials and utilities, are seen as more insulated from tariff impacts. The article emphasizes that despite the uncertainty, the stock market has historically shown resilience, and a patient, long-term approach often proves effective. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the societal decline in politeness, particularly in online interactions, negatively impacts individual happiness and mental health. Citing social science research, it posits that practicing courtesy—even towards nonhuman entities like AI—can measurably increase one's own happiness and reduce anger. The author suggests that individuals can counteract this cultural trend by making politeness a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity, thereby improving their own well-being and exercising personal freedom in a coarse culture.</p>

          <p>In a narrowly decided vote, the Bank of England has cut its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, its lowest point since March 2023. The decision, the fifth cut since last August, aims to support a weak economy but comes as the Bank raises its inflation forecast. This move will provide some relief to homeowners with tracker mortgages but will likely result in lower returns for savers, reflecting the delicate balance policymakers are trying to strike between stimulating growth and controlling rising prices.

These firms have already pledged tens of billions of dollars for new and expanded factories in states like Arizona and Texas, leading investors to believe they will be shielded from the most severe impacts of the new trade policy.

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a significant victory to arts and humanities groups, ruling that the Trump administration's abrupt cancellation of previously approved grants was "unlawful." The lawsuit was initiated after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The judge's decision stated that the administration likely violated the Constitution, as the power to allocate federal funds rests exclusively with Congress, not the President. This ruling allows the lawsuit against the grant cuts to proceed.</p>
