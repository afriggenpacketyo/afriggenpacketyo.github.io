        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff criticized Red Bull's protest against George Russell as "petty" and "embarrassing" after Russell's victory at the Canadian Grand Prix. Red Bull protested Russell's driving behind the safety car, alleging "unsportsmanlike behavior," but the stewards rejected the protest. Wolff emphasized that the victory was fair and questioned the timing and basis of Red Bull's complaint, suggesting the FIA should review such actions. Christian Horner, Red Bull's boss, defended the team's right to protest, stating they saw something they believed was not quite right, and they have no regrets about raising the issue with the stewards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Reddit user's berry storage hack, involving washing, drying, and storing raspberries in an airtight glass container with a paper towel, has gained popularity online. Food expert Mark Wieser suggests waiting to wash berries until just before eating, gently soaking them in water, and storing them in a paper towel-lined container. He also notes that different berries have different cleaning needs, with blueberries being sturdier than delicate strawberries and raspberries. Wieser also recommends a vinegar bath for commercially produced strawberries to remove pesticide residue, emphasizing the importance of keeping berries cold and dry for optimal preservation.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will eliminate FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will not launch new products with these ingredients. About 10% of their U.S. items, including brands like Crystal Light and Jell-O, currently use these synthetic additives. The decision follows pressure from the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services to reduce artificial dyes, with the FDA planning to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year. Kraft Heinz looks forward to partnering with the administration to provide quality, affordable, and wholesome food for all.</p>

          <h2>Targeted Cancer Drugs May Replace Chemo for Some Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a class of targeted cancer therapies, could potentially replace chemotherapy due to their ability to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs, with some showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. However, some cancer experts believe more refinement is needed before ADCs can fully replace chemo, citing challenges like the premature release of toxic chemotherapy payloads into the bloodstream and the need for identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target. Despite these challenges, the ADC field has made significant progress, with more than a dozen ADCs now approved in the U.S. and hundreds more in development.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates National Guard rescued the crew of an oil tanker after a collision involving two vessels near the Strait of Hormuz. The incident involved the crude oil tanker Adalynn and the Front Eagle oil tanker, with the Adalynn bound for Egypt's Suez Canal. British maritime security firm Ambrey stated the collision was not security-related, while Frontline, the shipping company for Front Eagle, described it as a navigational incident unrelated to the conflict between Israel and Iran. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital maritime entry point to the Persian Gulf, accounting for the passage of around a fifth of the world's oil.</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the UK, mistakenly referring to it as an agreement with the European Union, during a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 Summit. He stated the agreement was similar to one signed in May and would produce jobs and income. Trump left the G7 summit early to address "very important" issues, specifically citing the situation in the Middle East, and cancelling planned meetings with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Mexican President Sheinbaum. The White House provided details on steel and aluminum in the US-UK agreement, with Commerce Secretary Lutnick determining product quotas.</p>
