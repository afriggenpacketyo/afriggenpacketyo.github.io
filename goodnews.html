          <p>Scientists in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants to treat their wounds and injuries, both on themselves and on each other. The article details the observation of chimps dabbing plants on wounds and chewing them to create a paste for application. The research builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate by eating certain plants. This article highlights the potential for empathy in wild chimpanzees, as they were observed tending to the wounds of unrelated individuals. The research includes anecdotal evidence from a field station logbook dating back to the 1990s, which describes various chimpanzee behaviors, including leaf-dabbing on injuries and hygiene practices.</p>
