          <p>The LA Galaxy secured a decisive 4-0 victory against Santos Laguna, allowing them to advance to the Quarterfinals of the Leagues Cup. Needing a win by at least three goals, the team established an early lead with a goal from Joseph Paintsil just 51 seconds into the match. The Galaxy extended their lead to 3-0 by halftime, with additional goals from Matheus Nascimento and Maya Yoshida. Santos Laguna's difficulties were compounded by two red cards, forcing them to play the second half with only nine players, and Nascimento later scored his second goal to seal the comprehensive win.</p>

Meanwhile, Manchester City has refreshed its team with five new signings to bounce back from a trophy-less season. Chelsea, after winning the Club World Cup, has also added significant new players, signaling their intent to compete for top honors in both domestic and European competitions.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group surged 13% to a record high, marking their best single-day performance in five years. The jump followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and marking a sharp turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. The strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, their largest increase since 2021. This was attributed to positive returns from both private investments and listed portfolio companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, covering all children born in the U.S. who would be affected by the order. The ruling states that the plaintiffs are highly likely to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm, resolving the lawsuit she filed after being fired from 'The Mandalorian' in 2021. Her termination followed controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. Carano, whose lawsuit was financially backed by Elon Musk, had sought damages and to be recast in the series. While the settlement terms are private, Carano expressed hope for 'healing,' and Lucasfilm released a statement describing her as a respected and kind colleague, suggesting potential future collaboration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will host a peace summit at the White House on Friday for the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia. In a social media post, Trump stated that a historic peace agreement, along with bilateral economic deals between the U.S. and each nation, will be signed. The two countries have been engaged in a conflict for many years, resulting in thousands of deaths. Trump credited his administration's long-term engagement with both sides for achieving the breakthrough, which he described as a success where many previous leaders had failed to end the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk confirmed the sighting with a photograph, which was verified by experts. The species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be at least partially driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant ecological event, it is uncertain if the butterfly will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK due to differences in available food sources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning off the Amadea, a luxurious 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million that was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features a helideck, a glass elevator, a mosaic pool, and a marble fireplace. The Justice Department maintains the ship was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, who was sanctioned in 2018 for his role in advancing Russia's malign activities. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit and is part of a broader U.S. effort to pressure oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin to compel an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>
