          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region showed mixed results as investors processed developments from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit and ongoing trade uncertainties. Sentiment was impacted by a recent U.S. federal court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal, alongside his continued criticism of India's trade policies. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was flat and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced a slight decline amid the cautious atmosphere.

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York and the state's longest-serving member in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing a "necessity for generational change," the 78-year-old congressman stated his decision was influenced by observing the challenges faced by older politicians in the current political climate. Nadler, first elected in 1992, is known for his role as chair of the House Judiciary Committee during the first impeachment of Donald Trump. His retirement opens up a key seat in a prominent Democratic district.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, has spoken out about the significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. In a tour of the historic building, she pointed out obstacles like heavy doors with round handles, long distances to accessible toilets, and archaic procedures that create barriers for disabled MPs. Tidball is advocating for changes to make Parliament more inclusive, arguing that the institution must better reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. A parliamentary committee is currently reviewing these issues to propose improvements.</p>

          <p>This article features the Old Faithful Inn, a historic lodge in Yellowstone National Park renowned as a benchmark of "parkitecture." Built in 1904 using "freaks of the forest"—uniquely twisted logs—it was once advertised as the world's largest log cabin. The inn's rustic and grand design has welcomed millions of visitors, including presidents, and has influenced the architecture of many other national park lodges across the United States. The piece highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve its historic character while maintaining it for modern travelers, celebrating it as a human-made national treasure.</p>

Seeking to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win, manager Arne Slot evolved the team with major signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak.

          <p>A recent study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new dating, achieved through advanced uranium-series techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and resolves decades of debate over its age. The fossil's features are distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans, strengthening the theory that it belongs to Homo heidelbergensis or a related archaic population. This finding suggests that different human lineages coexisted in Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of human evolution.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom. This rare viewing opportunity, extending further south than usual, is due to heightened solar activity from a recent coronal mass ejection. While visibility depends on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, sky-gazers in areas as far south as the Midlands could witness the celestial display. The best chances for a sighting are predicted for Monday and Tuesday nights.</p>
