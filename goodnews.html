          <p>England's Red Roses secured their third Women's Rugby World Cup title with a dominant 33-13 victory over Canada at Twickenham. The final was played in front of a record-breaking crowd of 81,885 for a women's rugby match. After conceding an early try, England responded decisively, with standout performances from Ellie Kildunne and Alex Matthews, who scored two tries. This victory extends England's remarkable winning streak to 33 consecutive games and marks their first world championship since 2014, capping a memorable year for English women's sport following the Lionesses' Euro 2025 win.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that an Israeli-supplied, US-made Patriot air defense system has been operational in Ukraine for the past month. He also announced that two additional Patriot systems are expected to arrive this autumn. This development is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide direct military aid to Ukraine, as it has sought to maintain a delicate relationship with Russia. The move may signal a shift in Israeli policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran. The advanced air defense systems are crucial for Ukraine's ability to defend against Russian missile and drone attacks.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its publication, Judy Blume's novel "Forever" remains a significant cultural touchstone for its frank and female-centric depiction of teenage sexuality. The article reflects on how the book became a rite of passage for many young readers, often passed around secretly among friends. Its power lay in its validation of teenage desires and anxieties from a young woman's perspective, a viewpoint rarely seen in popular culture at the time. By addressing topics of sex and relationships openly, the novel provided a crucial space for young people to see their own complex feelings reflected and normalized, cementing its legacy in young adult literature.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Davis broke significant barriers in an industry dominated by white men when she began her career in the 1960s. Over her five-decade career with stations like KPIX and KQED in the San Francisco Bay Area, she became a trusted and respected figure, known for her integrity, grace, and mentorship. She covered pivotal moments in history, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards and lifetime achievement honors for her groundbreaking work.</p>

          <p>Simplify Asset Management and VettaFi have launched a new actively managed ETF, the Simplify VettaFi Private Credit Strategy ETF (PCR), designed to give retail investors access to the private credit market. This asset class, which involves lending to companies by non-bank institutions, has traditionally been accessible only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new ETF provides indirect exposure through publicly traded business development companies (BDCs), offering a liquid alternative to traditional private credit funds that often have high fees and lockup periods. The launch aims to capitalize on the booming private credit market's potential for high-income yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has died at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II after joining the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944. He went on to serve with distinction in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, flying a combined 115 combat missions. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. armed forces, celebrated for their courage and skill in the face of systemic racism. Hardy's passing leaves only 13 documented original members of the historic group still alive.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives a comfortable life on approximately $4,000 a month. His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill for his master's degree studies, and part-time work teaching English. Ryan contrasts the low cost of living and sense of safety in Vietnam with the financial pressures and lack of motivation he felt in the U.S., stating that life abroad allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than just survival. He highlights the ability to escape a cycle of poverty and pursue personal goals as a key benefit of his expatriate life.</p>

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investment firm, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023, which led CCO to divest its international assets and become a U.S. pure-play business. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has underperformed, trading at a lower multiple than its peers. Anson argues that a sale is the best path forward for shareholders, given the company's significant debt and the slow pace of its high-value digital billboard conversion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and documentarian known for his unconventional television interviews, has died at the age of 103. An Austrian Jew, Troller fled the Nazis in his youth, emigrated to the U.S., and later returned to Europe as a GI, serving as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He settled in Paris and gained fame working for German television, where his sensitive and subjective interview style on the show "Personenbeschreibung" captured conversations with luminaries like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen. His remarkable life story is one of survival, artistic innovation, and profound reflection on 20th-century history.</p>
