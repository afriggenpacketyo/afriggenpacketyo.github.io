          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting the concept of 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and interests over career advancement. This shift marks a departure from the traditional Japanese work ethic of long hours and unwavering company loyalty, with many younger employees now choosing to do the bare minimum required by their jobs. A study indicates that nearly half of Japanese workers are 'quiet quitters,' motivated by a desire for more 'me time' and a better work-life balance. This trend also reflects a disillusionment with the sacrifices made by previous generations, who often prioritized work at the expense of their personal lives.</p>

          <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed skepticism about the feasibility of NATO members meeting President Trump's demand to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP. Mitsotakis suggested that 3.5% is a more realistic ceiling for hard defense spending, but acknowledged that the 5% target could be achievable in the long term if broader security-related expenses are included. His remarks highlight the ongoing debate among NATO members about defense spending contributions and the challenges of meeting the alliance's targets.
