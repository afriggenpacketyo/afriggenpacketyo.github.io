          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, moving beyond treating female athletes as "mini-men." Researchers are studying the unique effects of elite sports on the female body, including breast biomechanics and the impact of sports bras on performance. The article also explores the complex relationship between the menstrual cycle and athletic ability, as well as the higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears in women. This growing body of research aims to improve performance, health, and retention of women in sports by addressing previously taboo or overlooked topics.</p>

          <p>The United States Treasury Department has modernized its public debt reduction program by allowing Americans to make contributions via the popular payment app Venmo. This new, youth-friendly option is an addition to existing methods like PayPal and credit cards for citizens who wish to voluntarily help pay down the nation's $36.72 trillion debt. The "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" initiative has collected approximately $67.3 million since 1996. The article notes this amount is a small fraction of the government's annual spending, highlighting the immense scale of the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first aired, some psychologists and social experts are re-evaluating the impact of reality television, suggesting it may have positive effects. The genre often features more demographic diversity than other media, potentially increasing social understanding by exposing viewers to different lifestyles and perspectives. The article argues that watching unscripted interactions can help audiences grasp social cues, while shows tackling health or disability can reduce stigma and isolation. While acknowledging the potential harm to contestants, experts note these programs can spark important national conversations on complex topics like coercive control.</p>

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing a significant supply crunch and driving up prices. Fueled by social media trends and a tourism boom in Japan, demand has outstripped supply, which has been hampered by heatwaves affecting tea crops and a shortage of farmers. Retailers in Japan are limiting purchases, and importers are struggling to keep up with orders from cafes. The situation is further complicated by new U.S. tariffs on Japanese products, which are expected to increase costs for consumers and distributors in the American market.</p>

          <p>A 59-year-old career nurse shared feelings of being "defeated and cooked" on a Reddit forum after learning a coworker in the same salary range had saved $460,000 more for retirement. The nurse, with about $240,000 in a 401(k) plus a pension and other savings, felt his own plan was inadequate in comparison. The online community responded with encouragement, advising against comparison and highlighting the significant value of his pension. Many users offered practical advice, such as focusing on expenses rather than savings totals and exploring less physically demanding nursing roles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) artists are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a major mainstream breakthrough for the genre. The article explores the multi-million dollar industry behind this music, which often mirrors mainstream styles but with faith-based lyrics. Experts note a trend towards a "barstool conversion rock" style, blending country, conservative politics, and masculinity. The influence of megachurches in creating plug-and-play worship experiences for smaller congregations is also discussed as a key driver of the genre's sound and economic model.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds that the Trump administration had abruptly frozen just before they were due to be distributed to states. The funding, which supports programs like educator training and arts education, was withheld after the Office of Management and Budget claimed it found instances of funds subsidizing a "radical left-wing agenda." The decision to freeze the money sparked bipartisan backlash, with 10 Republican senators joining educators in urging the administration to release the congressionally approved funds for the upcoming school year.</p>

          <p>An app named Tea, which allows women to review and share information about men they have dated, has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. The platform is designed as a safety tool, enabling users to vet potential dates, check for criminal records, and warn others about negative experiences. While similar forums exist on social media, Tea's centralization and scale, with over 1.6 million users, have contributed to its popularity. The app's rise highlights a demand for greater safety features in the online dating world, though it also faces concerns about misinformation and data security.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating U.S.-China tensions and parental fears about instability, Chinese students continue to pursue higher education in the United States, though they are becoming more selective. Applicants are now prioritizing highly-ranked programs, the reputation of specific schools, and the availability of financial aid. The article profiles one student who, despite his mother's concerns, chose to attend Brandeis University for its academic freedom and five-year master's program. This trend suggests that while the appeal of an American education persists, students are carefully weighing the perceived risks against the opportunities offered by top institutions.</p>

          <p>According to the Fire and Rescue Services Association (FRSA), more than 10,000 former retained, or on-call, firefighters across the UK are eligible for but have not claimed pension payments they are owed. Following recent legal rulings, those who served between April 2000 and April 2006 are now entitled to a pension for their entire career. The payments, which can range from thousands to over £100,000, require firefighters to "buy back" their contributions. The union is urging anyone who might qualify to contact their former employers to initiate a claim for the funds.</p>
