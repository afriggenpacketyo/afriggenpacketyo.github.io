          <h2>English Premier League Considers Replacing Financial Profit and Sustainability Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 12:06:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English Premier League is nearing a decision on whether to replace its current profit and sustainability rules (PSR), which limit club losses to £105 million over three years. Chief executive Richard Masters indicated that an "alternative system" is under consideration, with a decision expected in November. The proposed change involves a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's regulations, which would allow clubs to spend a set percentage of their revenue on squad-related costs. This move aims to align with European standards while still encouraging investment in the league.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, according to the World Happiness Report. Experts suggest this ranking is less about daily joy and more about a deep sense of contentment derived from a well-functioning society that provides strong social support. Key factors include accessible public services like comprehensive libraries, a high degree of trust in institutions, low levels of corruption, and a close connection to nature. The Finnish concept of happiness is rooted in life satisfaction and the assurance that the community will take care of its citizens.</p>

          <p>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer, 67, has revealed that becoming a grandmother last year has reinvigorated her love for acting. In a recent podcast appearance, she explained that this life change has helped her become more relaxed and present, shedding the deep, prolonged angst she previously associated with her process. Pfeiffer, who is currently working on multiple projects including a "Yellowstone" spinoff, feels this new perspective has freed her up and potentially improved her performances. She noted that she is more grateful than ever for her career and enjoys it more now than ever before.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after hitting Bermuda with heavy rain and powerful winds as a Category 2 hurricane. While hurricane-force gusts were recorded on the island, the worst conditions have passed, and there have been no immediate reports of significant damage. The National Hurricane Center has issued its final advisory for Imelda, though it will remain a large system as it moves across the Atlantic. Swells from the storm are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Two Delta Connection planes, operated by Endeavor Air, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when the wing of a departing aircraft struck the fuselage of an arriving plane. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was treated at the scene, while passengers were safely deplaned and accommodated on new flights. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the collision, which did not cause significant disruptions to overall airport operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta has launched a new AI-powered digital assistant called Business AI, designed to help companies provide personalized customer service and product recommendations. Initially available on Meta's own platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the company plans to offer the tool to businesses for use on their own websites, particularly those powered by Shopify. While the tool will be free for on-platform advertising integration, Meta will charge a fee for its use on external sites. This move represents a significant effort by Meta to monetize its substantial investments in generative AI beyond its core advertising business.</p>

          <p>Justin Halstenberg, 35, has been sentenced to 16 years to life in prison for starting two fires in San Bernardino County, including the 44,000-acre Line fire in September 2024. The blaze resulted in injuries to six firefighters and destroyed or damaged seven structures, with recovery costs estimated in the millions. Investigators were able to identify Halstenberg as the suspect after an automatic license plate reader placed his truck near the fire's origin point. The district attorney praised the conviction, stating it ensures a serial arsonist will no longer threaten the county.</p>

          <p>A team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe could be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. Researchers will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object for identification. If confirmed, the discovery could finally solve the 88-year-old mystery and fulfill Earhart's original plan to return the plane to the university.</p>

Officials from the Austin Police Department, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, and other city services announced the collaborative effort. The goal is to address community concerns through a targeted and multi-agency approach to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep historical analysis of Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, arguing against the enduring conspiracy theories recently amplified by former President Trump's call to declassify records. The author contends that the narrative of Earhart as a spy captured by the Japanese was largely fabricated for profit and propaganda during World War II, partly with the complicity of her own husband. The piece asserts that the most credible evidence shows Earhart and her navigator simply ran out of fuel and crashed at sea. It calls for remembering her for her real achievements.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, is a prudent decision in the current economic climate. With gold prices reaching record highs in 2025 and persistent inflation eroding the value of cash, the precious metal is presented as a potential hedge and a tool for portfolio diversification. The analysis notes that while timing any investment is difficult, factors like global uncertainty and strong central bank buying bolster the argument for holding gold as a safe-haven asset. The article suggests gold could provide stability during periods of market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article addresses a common investor misconception known as "low-price bias," the belief that lower-priced stocks have more upside potential than higher-priced ones. It argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value or growth potential, which should instead be assessed based on fundamentals like revenue growth and earnings outlook. Using the example of choosing between a lower-priced International Paper and a much higher-priced Nvidia in late 2023, the article demonstrates how focusing on the underlying business quality led to vastly superior returns.

          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches new all-time highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the popular "set-it-and-forget-it" strategy of solely relying on S&P 500 index funds. They argue that the market-cap-weighted index has become heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, reducing its diversification benefits and increasing risk. To achieve a more balanced portfolio, advisors suggest alternatives like total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or adding specific funds for international, value, and small-cap exposure to complement an S&P 500 position.

The holiday was set for October 3rd to avoid coinciding with November 9th, a date associated with the tragic 1938 Nazi pogroms. While an official festival is hosted by a different federal state each year, most Germans celebrate the day quietly.

          <p>Following her death at age 91, this article reflects on Jane Goodall's legacy beyond her groundbreaking primatology research. It highlights her radical and unwavering advocacy for animal rights, a stance that often set her apart from the mainstream scientific community. Goodall vocally opposed factory farming and invasive animal experimentation, particularly on primates, and lent her support to organizations seeking legal rights for animals. Her work challenged the scientific orthodoxy by arguing that recognizing animals' complex inner lives creates a moral imperative to end their exploitation, a message that remains profoundly influential.</p>
