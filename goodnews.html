        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that its global sales for May increased by 6.9 percent compared to the previous year, reaching a record high of 898,721 units for the month. The company attributed the strong performance to a surge in last-minute demand from consumers in the United States. This demand was reportedly driven by concerns that vehicle prices could soon rise due to the potential imposition of high tariffs by the U.S. government. In contrast to the sales growth, Toyota's global production experienced a slight decline of 0.7 percent for the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved evacuation plans for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, a crucial step toward potentially restarting the world's largest nuclear facility. The plant, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company, has been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The approval from the central government's nuclear disaster prevention council marks significant progress for Japan's nuclear energy policy under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. However, the final hurdle for the restart remains, as the operator must still secure the consent of local residents in Niigata Prefecture, where the complex is located.</p>

          <p>NATO is strengthening its engagement with the commercial space industry as part of a broader strategy to enhance its defense capabilities. Alliance members have pledged to more than double defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, with a portion dedicated to security-linked infrastructure like space and cyber warfare. Recognizing space as an operational domain, NATO's new commercial strategy aims to leverage private sector innovation for communication, navigation, and surveillance. This move comes as European leaders seek alternatives to services like Elon Musk's Starlink, which has played a crucial role in Ukraine, highlighting the strategic importance of a robust commercial space ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has created a comprehensive digital model of a human embryo, providing a powerful new tool to study the earliest stages of life. This high-resolution atlas maps out the critical period of early organogenesis, when a fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types to form tissues and organs. Scientists believe this model will offer unprecedented insights into how developmental abnormalities and diseases originate during this highly susceptible phase. The research, published in the journal 'Cell', represents a significant advance in understanding the intricate processes that orchestrate the beginning of human life.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, prominent economists argued that China must undergo significant structural reforms to transition into a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu of HKUST noted that China's current model, which heavily subsidizes production, creates trade imbalances and global friction. To achieve sustainable wealth and harmonize global trade relationships, she asserted that China needs to increase its internal consumption. The panel suggested that opportunities for growth exist in the services sector and that local governments should be incentivized to measure success based on consumption metrics, not just production output.</p>

          <p>A host of high-profile celebrities has arrived in Venice, Italy, for the wedding celebrations of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Tom Brady were seen attending a pre-wedding event ahead of the main ceremony. The gathering of approximately 200 guests has drawn some local protest, with a "No Space for Bezos" campaign emerging amid broader European concerns about over-tourism and rising costs. This will be the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez, who began their relationship after divorcing their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <h2>Xiaomi Shares Hit Record High After New EV Undercuts Tesla's Pricing</h2>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi surged to a record high following a strong customer response to its new electric vehicle, the YU7 SUV. The company priced the new model to be cheaper than Tesla's competing Model Y in China, a strategy that resulted in over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its launch. CEO Lei Jun claimed the YU7 surpasses the Model Y on several metrics, though it falls short on driver-assist features. This aggressive pricing continues Xiaomi's strategy from its first EV and intensifies the ongoing price war in the competitive Chinese electric car market. (not investment advice)</p>
