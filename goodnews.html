          <h2>Retirement Experts Highlight Annuity Mistakes Seniors Should Avoid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 09:10:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainties impact seniors, more are considering annuities for steady retirement income and protection against outliving savings. Experts advise seniors to understand annuity fees, including surrender charges and withdrawal penalties, and to ensure the annuity aligns with their long-term financial goals. Choosing the right type of annuity is crucial, with immediate annuities best for guaranteed income now, indexed annuities for growth with downside protection, and fixed annuities for predictable growth. Seniors should also designate a beneficiary to prevent annuity benefits from going through probate and avoid withdrawing excessive funds early, as annuities are designed for long-term income.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 09:05:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has maintained interest rates at 4.25% but indicated potential cuts as early as August. While inflation remains above the Bank's target rate, Governor Andrew Bailey stated rates are on a "gradual downward path," cautioning about global unpredictability due to the Iran-Israel conflict's impact on energy costs. The Bank noted a 26% rise in oil prices and an 11% increase in gas prices since May, marginally increasing expectations for the UK economy while acknowledging weak underlying growth. Wage growth is slowing, unemployment is rising, and businesses are hesitant to hire, suggesting a softening labor market.</p>

          <p>The Stanley Cup sustained damage, including a cracked bowl and a dented bottom, during the Florida Panthers' championship celebrations.

          <p>Double the number of households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter due to changes in the Warm Home Discount eligibility criteria. The government is scrapping the property size, type, and energy score qualification, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million with children. While debt charities welcome the move, some argue it still excludes those on non-means tested benefits. The cost of the expansion will be covered by energy companies and could be passed on through the standing charge, although the government aims to offset this with savings from cutting company expenditure and addressing problem debt.</p>
