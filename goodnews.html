          <p>A South Korean court has reopened a 1964 case involving Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted for grievous bodily harm after biting off her sexual attacker's tongue in self-defense at age 19. Inspired by the global #MeToo movement, Choi sought a retrial in 2020, which was initially rejected but eventually ordered by the top court in 2024. Prosecutors in the retrial have now issued an apology and requested the court to quash her guilty verdict, acknowledging the indescribable pain inflicted on a victim who should have been protected. The verdict, expected in September, offers hope for justice and a precedent for future sexual violence cases.</p>

          <p>A female hiker in Anchorage, Alaska, was successfully rescued with the assistance of advanced drone technology after being mauled by a brown bear on the Basher Trail. The hiker, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries, was able to call emergency officials herself and remained conscious, aiding rescuers in locating her in the remote area. This incident highlights the crucial role of preparedness for hikers, including carrying bear spray and remaining vigilant in bear-populated regions. The coordinated efforts of multiple agencies, including the Anchorage Police and Fire Departments, ensured a timely and effective rescue.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to enable institutional investors to purchase tokenized money market funds, marking a significant step in digital asset transformation. This initiative allows ownership to be recorded on Goldman's blockchain platform, promising faster settlement, round-the-clock trading, and enhanced automation for the $7.1 trillion industry. Major fund titans like BlackRock and Fidelity are already participating, viewing this as a foundation for a more efficient digital financial ecosystem where tokenized funds could eventually serve as collateral. This development aims to free up capital and time currently consumed by traditional transactions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Wearable camera firm GoPro and doughnut maker Krispy Kreme have become the latest targets of Reddit-obsessed retail traders, experiencing significant share price surges. Both stocks, previously trading at low prices, saw their shares jump significantly, driven by high short interest and heightened speculative activity on WallStreetBets. This trend coincides with a record-setting rally in the broader market, fueled by positive economic news and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The phenomenon reflects a continued interest in high-risk, all-in trading strategies among certain investor cohorts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Stanley Forman's powerful 1975 photograph of a collapsing fire escape, which resulted in the death of a 19-year-old woman, became a catalyst for significant safety reforms in Boston. The image, which earned Forman a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the tragic fall of a young woman and a child, shaking the city and raising public awareness about neglected fire escapes. Within months of its publication, Boston implemented new city codes requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years. This landmark photo had a lasting ripple effect, influencing fire safety regulations across the country.</p>

          <p>Uber is set to pilot a new safety feature next month in the U.S. that will allow women drivers and riders to request to be paired exclusively with other women. This initiative aims to provide women with more choice, control, and comfort on the ride-hailing platform, addressing long-standing safety concerns and past incidents of sexual assault and harassment. While not guaranteed for every ride, the feature is designed to increase the likelihood of women-to-women pairings. Uber previously rolled out a similar preference for female drivers in Saudi Arabia in 2019, which later expanded to numerous countries.</p>

          <p>Texas state representative James Talarico, a 36-year-old former teacher and aspiring minister, has garnered significant national attention following an appearance on Joe Rogan's widely influential podcast. The interview, where Talarico discussed his progressive Christian views and challenged Republican policies, positioned him as a potential rising star in Texas Democratic politics. His ability to engage with Rogan's largely right-leaning audience, despite some backlash, has been seen as a model for Democrats to connect with broader electorates. Talarico's increasing popularity and ambition suggest a potential bid for higher office, reflecting a shift in the left's approach to engaging diverse voters.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have overcome the long-standing "dimensionality curse" in aircraft design, a breakthrough that could significantly advance drone technology. Their new software platform allows for an unlimited number of design variables without increasing computing load, a feat previously deemed impossible in aviation. To illustrate their innovation, researchers applied the system to the US Navy's X-47B stealth drone, a project canceled in 2015 due to unresolved design trade-offs. The Chinese design reportedly delivered dramatic improvements in areas like flight drag, radar signature, and engine thrust, potentially unlocking new possibilities for advanced aircraft development.</p>

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological anomaly by incorporating chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and then performing photosynthesis, effectively transforming light, water, and air into its own food. This fascinating ability, which allows the slug to turn a brilliant green, challenges traditional understandings of animal biology and evolution. Scientists are still unraveling the precise mechanisms, including potential gene transfer from algae to slug, suggesting that symbiosis may play a much larger and more pervasive role in evolution than previously recognized. This creature serves as a compelling example of how easily boundaries between organisms and their environments can be traversed.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China's significant leadership in green energy production, particularly in solar panels and electric vehicles, positions it to redefine global governance and address climate instability. With the cost of solar power dropping dramatically, China's dominance in this sector is undeniable due to its high-quality, flexible, and integrated supply chain. However, the article emphasizes that for this leadership to be truly beneficial, China must ensure its green energy initiatives serve the broader global good. This perspective underscores the immense opportunity for China to drive a worldwide green revolution while facing the responsibility of its dominant role.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are currently offering attractive interest rates that surpass the current inflation rate, making them a viable option for saving money. These safe investments typically come with FDIC or NCUA insurance, protecting balances up to $250,000. While national averages vary, top rates for short-term CDs (6 months to 1 year) are notably higher than longer terms due to an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, consumers are advised to explore online banks, which often have lower overheads and pass savings onto customers.

          <p>A debate has emerged over whether England's impactful substitutes, Michelle Agyemang and Chloe Kelly, should be promoted to the starting lineup for the Euro 2025 final. Both players proved crucial "finishers" in the semi-final, scoring late goals to secure victory and mirroring their decisive contributions in earlier knockout games. While manager Sarina Wiegman typically favors a consistent starting eleven, some experts argue that bringing in fresh legs for the final against Germany or Spain could be vital given the team's recent back-to-back extra-time matches.
