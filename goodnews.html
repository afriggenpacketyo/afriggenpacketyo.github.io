          <h2>US and Japan Finalize Major Trade Agreement, Reducing Auto Tariffs to 15%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 23:03:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes setting reciprocal tariffs at 15%. A key component of the agreement is the reduction of U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%, a move that provided relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry. The deal, which Trump claimed would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S., was met with a strong positive reaction in Japanese markets, with major auto stocks soaring. The agreement is also seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the latest Henley Passport Index, Singapore once again holds the title for the world's most powerful passport, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. Japan and South Korea tied for second place, while several European nations rounded out the top rankings. The index highlights a continued decline for the United States and the United Kingdom, which have slipped to 10th and 6th place, respectively, after once holding the top position. The ranking primarily measures the number of destinations a passport holder can visit without a prior visa, reflecting global mobility and diplomatic strength.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese firms are being encouraged to integrate more deeply with local economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods transshipped through countries like Vietnam to circumvent levies on Chinese products. An economist from the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local supply chains, Chinese businesses can better shield themselves from unpredictable trade policies. This strategy is seen as a long-term solution as Chinese exports currently face an average U.S. tariff rate of 42%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese automotive stocks experienced a significant rally after it was announced that the U.S. would lower tariffs on auto imports from 25% to 15%. Shares for major companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda saw substantial gains, with some surging by double-digit percentages. The tariff reduction is part of a broader trade deal announced by President Trump, which he hailed as a massive agreement. Auto exports are a critical component of Japan's economy, accounting for over 28% of all shipments to the U.S. in 2024, making the tariff news particularly impactful for the sector.

Scott exited Monday's game with a stinging sensation in his forearm, but reports on Tuesday indicated he was feeling better. While the team awaits a full review of his MRI results, the initial diagnosis offers hope for his return later this season. The injury underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline, as their bullpen has been impacted by several other key injuries throughout the year.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a history stretching back 250 years. Originally a Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, which dated the ship's timbers, and archival research conducted by archaeologists and local community members. The ship wrecked in 1788, but all 56 crew members survived, and its timbers are now being preserved by the local heritage center.</p>
