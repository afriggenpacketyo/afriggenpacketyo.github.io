          <p>During President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, the White House announced a commitment from the kingdom to invest $600 billion in a series of deals with the United States. The agreements include a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal providing Saudi Arabia with state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to raise the U.S.-Saudi partnership to $1 trillion across various sectors. The investment pledge faces challenges due to lower oil prices and Saudi Arabia's own Vision 2030 ambitions. </p>

          <p>The Kurdish militant group PKK announced the end of its armed insurgency against Turkey, a move that will impact not only Turkey but also Iraq and Syria. The PKK's decision to disarm follows a call from its founder, Abdullah Ocalan, and aims to resolve a decades-long conflict. This decision is expected to reassure Turkey and potentially facilitate a deal between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Damascus. However, some PKK supporters are unhappy with the decision, and the future of fugitive PKK fighters remains uncertain.</p>
