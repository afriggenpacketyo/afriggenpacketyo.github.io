          <p>President Donald Trump recently suggested the Washington Commanders should revert to their former "Redskins" name, publicly threatening to halt the team's plans to build a new stadium in the nation's capital if they refused. However, both D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Commanders General Manager Adam Peters remain unfazed by these comments. Bowser emphasized that the stadium deal is in its final stages and a blockage is unlikely, while Peters stated his focus remains solely on the team's on-field performance, regardless of location. Trump also called for the Cleveland Guardians to revert to their old name, but both professional sports organizations have indicated no plans for further name changes.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates an extension to President Donald Trump's upcoming trade deadline with China, with discussions scheduled in Stockholm. The current 90-day tariff suspension, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. Bessent views the trade relationship as constructive, hoping talks will also address China's manufacturing glut and its aid to Russia. This follows previous agreements to reduce tariffs, aiming for continued progress in global trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey opted not to appoint former Trump attorney Alina Habba as the state's permanent U.S. attorney. Habba, who served as acting U.S. attorney since March, was replaced by her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized the decision, calling it partisan. Habba's tenure included politically charged prosecutions against Democratic figures and challenges to immigration policies, and she faced opposition for Senate confirmation from New Jersey's Democratic senators.</p>
