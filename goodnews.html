          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 17:51:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key inflation measure in the United States indicated a slowdown in price growth during April, even as President Trump's tariffs were implemented. Consumer spending decreased despite rising incomes, suggesting a possible early reaction to higher prices on imported goods. The Commerce Department reported that consumer prices increased by 2.1% year-over-year, a decrease from March's 2.3% and the lowest since September, indicating a continued decline from the post-pandemic inflation spike. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring core prices and is likely to maintain stable interest rates while assessing the impact of tariffs on inflation and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump commended Elon Musk for his work leading the DOGE initiative, aimed at improving government efficiency, as Musk concluded his tenure. Trump praised Musk for bringing "colossal change" to Washington and presented him with a golden key to the White House. Musk, despite facing criticism and challenges, vowed that his departure would not be the end of DOGE's influence. The DOGE initiative faced numerous hurdles, including protests from labor unions and Democrats, and fell short of its initial cost-cutting goals, achieving $175 billion in savings compared to the original $2 trillion target.</p>
