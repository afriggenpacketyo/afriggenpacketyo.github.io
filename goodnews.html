          <p>Amazon's Zoox has officially entered the robotaxi market with its launch in Las Vegas, offering free rides initially before expanding across the city. Unlike competitors, Zoox's electric robotaxi is custom-built without a steering wheel or pedals, designed from the ground up for autonomous driving. The company plans to debut an early rider program in San Francisco and is testing in other cities like Austin and Miami. Zoox aims to provide a unique rider experience with features like bidirectional wheels, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a spacious interior, emphasizing safety and a focus on the rider experience. The launch represents a significant step for Amazon in the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>

          <p>Klarna, the online lender known for its buy now, pay later services, priced its IPO at $40 per share, exceeding expectations and valuing the company at $15 billion. The IPO raised $1.37 billion for the company and existing shareholders, with shares set to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KLAR." Klarna aims to rebrand as a digital retail bank, and the IPO serves as a test of Wall Street's interest in this shift. Despite a net loss in the second quarter, revenue increased, driven by merchant fees, interest on longer-term financing, and late fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the meaning of home from a peaceful woodland near the River Thames, where interred ashes fertilize the soil for young trees. The author contemplates the privilege of returning home to see family, even after they've passed, highlighting the contrast with those who experience war and cannot properly mark the deaths of loved ones. The woodland serves as a personal sanctuary, a place to reflect on life's journey and appreciate the peace and dignity afforded in death. The author's tone is reflective and grateful, emphasizing the importance of peace and remembrance.</p>

          <p>The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for Federal Reserve governor, following a judge's block on Trump firing another Fed governor. Miran's nomination to replace Adriana Kugler comes before a key Fed meeting to discuss potential interest rate cuts. If confirmed, Miran would serve until January 31, the end of Kugler's term, and he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his current White House position. Democrats are concerned about Miran's continued affiliation with the Council of Economic Advisors, and Trump has indicated the possibility of nominating someone else for a full 14-year term.

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently at 5.76% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.58% for a 30-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.01% for a 15-year refinance and 6.73% for a 30-year refinance. Experts recommend strengthening credit profiles and shopping around for the best rates. Borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, and comparing different lenders is crucial. Consider loan terms, fees, and overall costs before locking in a rate, and calculating monthly payments to ensure affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wholesale prices unexpectedly fell 0.1% in August, offering potential relief for the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut. The producer price index (PPI) showed a decrease, contrary to expectations of a rise, with core PPI also declining. Services prices, a key metric for the Fed, dropped, driven by a slide in trade services prices. The data suggests that inflation pressures at the producer level are easing, potentially paving the way for a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>
