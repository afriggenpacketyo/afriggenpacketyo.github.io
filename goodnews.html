        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Boston are exploring the possibility of opening city-owned grocery stores to improve access to fresh and affordable food, an idea gaining traction in other U.S. cities like New York and already implemented in Atlanta. Proponents argue such initiatives can serve communities underserved by private grocers, citing early success in Atlanta. However, the proposal faces significant skepticism from economists and conservative think tanks, who warn that government-run stores are often inefficient, require substantial taxpayer subsidies to compete, and could ultimately harm the private grocery market by operating on artificially low margins.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia, who missed an entire year with an ACL injury, scored a decisive winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham. His recent form, with three goals in his last four appearances, marks a significant turnaround after a challenging recovery period. Buendia, once the club's record signing, was nearly transferred but chose to stay and fight for his place in the team. The victory is Aston Villa's third consecutive league win, signaling a recovery from a poor start to the season and moving the team up the Premier League table.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter used her recent hosting and musical guest appearance on "Saturday Night Live" to address criticism of her provocative public image. Through a series of sketches, including one spoofing a QVC pillow that resembled female genitalia, she playfully pushed back against the idea that her sexuality is problematic. Her opening monologue directly referenced the controversy surrounding her album cover for "Man’s Best Friend," which some critics deemed regressive. Carpenter's performance served as a commentary on the scrutiny faced by young female artists, particularly former Disney stars, who embrace a more adult and sexualized persona.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team clinched a place in the World Cup semi-finals after a dramatic four-run victory against co-hosts India. England set a target of 289, anchored by a century from Heather Knight, but India appeared poised for victory at 234-3. The turning point came with the dismissal of India's opener Smriti Mandhana for 88, which triggered a middle-order collapse under pressure. Despite a late effort from Deepti Sharma, India fell just short, finishing on 284-6, handing England a crucial win as they approach the tournament's knockout stages.</p>

          <p>Following a trip to San Francisco for Salesforce's AI conference, financial analyst Jim Cramer shared ten key takeaways for investors based on conversations with various CEOs. He noted that Salesforce's AI platform is showing real-world use cases without cannibalizing its core business, and that the AI chip market is not a zero-sum game between Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. Other insights included growing skepticism about OpenAI's consumer product strategy, the potential of Meta's smart glasses, and a recommendation to sell nuclear and quantum computing stocks due to their lack of near-term commercial viability.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 35-7 at Wembley Stadium in London, improving their record to 5-2. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns, three of which were caught by receiver Davante Adams, despite the absence of injured star Puka Nacua. The Rams' defense was also dominant, recording seven sacks on Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The victory concludes a nine-day road trip for the Rams, who now head into their bye week with their best start to a season since their Super Bowl-winning year in 2021.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers under two income-driven repayment plans it had previously blocked. The decision is the result of a legal agreement with the American Federation of Teachers, which sued the administration for halting the programs. The Department of Education will again cancel debt for eligible borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment and Pay as You Earn plans. The administration had paused the relief, citing a court order related to a separate Biden-era program, a move that consumer advocates argued was an overly broad interpretation of the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills as part of its efforts to tackle the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband indicated that the government is "looking at all of these issues" ahead of the November Budget, though he did not confirm a specific policy change. The move, which would save the average household around £86 per year, comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs. Miliband emphasized that the long-term solution to high bills is a transition to home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets.</p>

The study evaluates passenger satisfaction based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, staff, and food and retail options. For the second consecutive year, the same three airports topped the list, demonstrating consistent performance in fundamental services such as cleanliness and TSA efficiency. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a major impact on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

The team, comprised of players now living in Australia, the UK, and Europe, will play against Chad, Libya, and the UAE. For the players, the tournament represents more than just a return to the sport; it is an act of defiance and a platform to represent the silenced women and girls in their homeland.

          <p>Thousands of sheep and goats were herded through the streets of Madrid for the annual Transhumance Festival, a tradition that honors the ancient practice of moving livestock to seasonal pastures. The event, which drew large crowds, highlights the environmental benefits of grazing, such as clearing flammable undergrowth to reduce wildfire risks. This year's festival carried extra significance following Spain's destructive wildfire season. As part of the tradition, organizers paid a symbolic fee of 50 medieval coins to city officials for the animals' safe passage, a custom dating back to a 1418 agreement between shepherds and the city.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after the worst clashes since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The conflict escalated after Islamabad accused the Taliban of harboring armed groups that attack Pakistan, a charge the Taliban denies. Both sides have reported heavy casualties, and under the new agreement, they have committed to ending hostile actions and refraining from targeting each other.</p>
