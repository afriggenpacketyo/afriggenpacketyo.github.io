          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour title in over two years by winning the St Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole play-off against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a play-off at this year's Masters, held his nerve to claim victory in Memphis. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a lead but finished one shot behind, continuing his long wait for a first PGA Tour victory despite a successful career. Rose's victory marks a significant return to form for the 45-year-old.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures in England to simplify the hiring process for newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to recruit more proactively based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move as a source of hope for students, NHS employer representatives raised concerns about how the changes would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance made a strong case in the competition for the backup role. Lance demonstrated growing confidence, using his mobility to extend plays and scoring a five-yard touchdown on a designed run. While his passing statistics were modest, his performance on the ground, with 48 rushing yards, has seemingly narrowed the gap with veteran Taylor Heinicke. The game also highlighted promising plays from the Chargers' defense and special teams, providing key insights into the team's depth ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered a critically endangered spider monkey hidden in a backpack inside his vehicle. The man, Juan Manuel Valdez, admitted to smuggling the animal and gave conflicting stories, first claiming it was for his children and later that he intended to sell it. The incident underscores the serious issue of illegal wildlife trafficking, which threatens species survival, undermines conservation, and can introduce diseases. The man is now in federal custody pending legal proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Dave Ramsey Counsels Divorced Man on Using a HELOC to Buy Out Ex-Wife</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a notable departure from his usual anti-debt stance, financial personality Dave Ramsey advised a caller to take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC). The caller, a recently divorced father, needed to pay his ex-wife her $150,000 share of their home's equity and wanted to keep the house for his children because of its low 2.25% mortgage rate. Ramsey approved the HELOC as a way to restructure existing debt but questioned the emotional reasoning for keeping the home, suggesting a sale might be a wiser long-term move.

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked commercial fishing within the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, overturning a Trump administration directive that had allowed it. The ruling reinstates protections established by President Obama for the federally protected area, which is a vital habitat for coral reefs, seabirds, and marine mammals. Environmental groups and Native Hawaiian advocates, who filed the lawsuit, celebrated the decision as a major victory for the rule of law and the preservation of irreplaceable marine ecosystems and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Community Shield match against Crystal Palace, which ended in a 2-2 draw and a penalty shootout loss, offered a first look at Arne Slot's revamped team. Four new signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer in a more advanced midfield role. The team showed flashes of offensive brilliance, with two debutants scoring, but also displayed significant defensive vulnerabilities that led to them twice surrendering a lead. The performance suggests that while the new-look squad has high potential, it will require time to adapt and fix its defensive bugs.</p>

          <p>A man in Austria survived a dangerous situation after he clung to the outside of a high-speed train as it departed a station.

The man was then brought aboard and was met by police upon arrival in Vienna. A railway spokesman condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible and potentially fatal.</p>
