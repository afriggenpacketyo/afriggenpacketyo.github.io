        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president and declares the DOGE officials who replaced him "illegitimately installed." The judge stated that the administration's actions to dissemble USIP, including terminating board members and dispersing its assets, were unlawful, as the agency is an independent think tank outside the executive branch. The article notes that the USIP is now able to resume its work in promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations, covering fishing, trade, defense, and energy, marking the biggest reboot since Brexit in 2020. The BBC article details that a key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats access to British waters for another 12 years in exchange for easing some trade frictions. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a move forward, some Conservatives and Reform UK criticized it as a "surrender" to the EU. The agreement also includes a security pact and cooperation on various issues like youth mobility and energy networks.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given suggests that midfielder Jack Grealish may need to leave the club this summer due to limited playing time. The BBC article notes that Grealish, a record signing in 2021, has seen his role diminish this season, leading to speculation about his future. Given argues that Grealish is being underutilized and deserves a fresh start at a club where he can be a central figure. The article also mentions that manager Pep Guardiola will discuss Grealish's future with club officials and the player's representatives.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that a luxury Boeing 747 gifted to the U.S. government by Qatar is standing by in San Antonio, Texas, awaiting a specialized overhaul to become the next Air Force One. The article explains that the offer of the $400 million plane came as Trump was leaving for a trip to the Middle East. Experts say retrofitting the plane could take years, and shortcuts could create national security risks. Members of Congress have also raised concerns, with some proposing a ban on retrofitting foreign planes as presidential aircraft.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has joined her husband, President Donald Trump, in signing a bill into law that criminalizes posting so-called "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content, according to the BBC. The Take It Down Act makes posting "intimate images" online without consent illegal and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups argue it's too broad and could lead to censorship. The article highlights the debate over balancing the protection of victims with concerns about free speech.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola says Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is the "second-best" passer he has worked with - after Argentine great Lionel Messi, according to the BBC. Guardiola holds the departing Belgian in high esteem, ahead of the likes of other pass-masters he has managed such as Andres Iniesta and Xavi at Barcelona, and former City midfielder David Silva. De Bruyne announced last month he will leave City after 10 years when his contract expires at the end of the season.</p>

          <p>French police have recovered by chance the long-lost bust of American singer Jim Morrison that once adorned the grave of the iconic frontman of The Doors, 37 years after it was stolen from a Paris cemetery, according to CBS News. The sculpture, missing since 1988, was found during a search tied to a fraud case led by the Paris public prosecutor's office, a source close to the investigation told AFP. Nostalgic rock fans still flock to Morrison's grave at the P√®re Lachaise cemetery in Paris, where he was buried after his death in the French capital in 1971 at the age of 27.</p>
