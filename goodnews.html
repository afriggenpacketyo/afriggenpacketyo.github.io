          <p>Former President Donald Trump is headlining the launch of 'America Prays,' an initiative encouraging citizens to pray for the nation weekly leading up to its 250th birthday. The program, supported by prominent faith leaders like Franklin Graham, emphasizes faith as a cornerstone of America's foundation and future. It partners with organizations such as Samaritan’s Purse and Pray.com to rally religious communities. Trump's message calls for a rededication to the principle of 'one nation under God' to strengthen the country for the next 250 years.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, stated that the central bank's monetary policy must remain 'fully independent of political influence,' including from President Trump. Speaking on 'Face the Nation,' Hassett warned that political control over central banks historically leads to inflation and economic hardship. His comments follow Trump's public pressure on current Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates and his inclusion of Hassett on a shortlist of replacements. Recent polling indicates a majority of Americans support the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her U.S. Open title, showcasing newfound emotional maturity and strategic resolve in her victory over Amanda Anisimova. The win marks her fourth Grand Slam title and underscores the lessons she learned from a difficult loss in the French Open final earlier in the year. After that defeat, Sabalenka reflected on the need to control her emotions and not expect easy victories. Her consistent high-level performance, reaching at least the semifinals in 11 of her last 12 Grand Slams, solidifies her position as one of tennis's most dominant players.</p>

          <p>The Oasis reunion tour, which played to a sold-out Rose Bowl, has become a significant cultural event, emphasizing communal experience and emotional release among fans. The concert review highlights how the audience's passionate singalongs to classic hits like 'Wonderwall' and 'Don't Look Back in Anger' are as central to the show as the band's performance. Despite the Gallagher brothers' famously contentious history, the tour has been marked by powerful moments of connection, positioning it as a major cultural touchstone. The performance itself was strong, but the focus remained on the shared catharsis of the thousands in attendance.</p>

          <h2>Propeller-Driven Aircraft Remain Essential for Weather Tracking Despite Advanced Jet Technology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 15:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Most modern weather-tracking aircraft, including the 'Hurricane Hunters' operated by NOAA and the U.S. Air Force, still rely on turboprop engines rather than jets. This is because propellers offer distinct advantages for storm reconnaissance, such as the ability to fly slower and lower, maximizing data collection time within a storm system. Turboprops are also more efficient at these lower altitudes and can operate from smaller, less-developed airfields, which is crucial when tracking storms in remote areas. These capabilities ensure that propeller-driven planes remain the gold standard for gathering critical weather data.</p>

          <p>England secured a record-breaking 342-run victory over South Africa in the third one-day international, driven by standout performances from Jacob Bethell and Jofra Archer. The 21-year-old Bethell scored his maiden professional century with an elegant 110 runs, supported by Joe Root who also reached 100, propelling England to a total of 414-5. In response, South Africa's batting lineup collapsed under a hostile opening spell from Archer, who took four wickets and reduced them to 7-4. The Proteas were ultimately all out for just 72, marking England's largest-ever victory margin by runs in men's ODIs.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of government data shows that U.S. residents are spending more on lottery tickets, with Massachusetts leading all states at an average of $915 per person annually. Rhode Island followed at $573 per person, while North Dakotans spent the least at just $50. The increased spending contributes significantly to state revenues, accounting for an average of 1% of general revenue and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island and West Virginia. An analyst suggested that higher spending in urbanized states could be linked to the greater convenience and availability of purchasing tickets.</p>

Guo was accused of illegally landing his plane in Chilean territory by providing a false flight plan during his solo journey to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research. As part of his release, he must pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from entering Chile for three years. His lawyer stated that while they disagree with the legal process, the case is now closed, and Guo is expected to leave the country soon.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after the team ordered his teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass. Norris had been running ahead of Piastri for most of the race, but a slow pit stop caused by a faulty wheel gun dropped him behind. McLaren justified the order by citing fairness, as the position change was due to a team error, though Piastri initially expressed disagreement over the radio before complying and finishing third.</p>

The driver, still in his racing suit and helmet, was taken into custody after a brief standoff.

In her year-long term, Baerbock will chair UN meetings and play a key role in preparing for the next UN Secretary-General election.
