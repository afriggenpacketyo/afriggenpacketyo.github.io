          <p>Bernie Sanders criticizes the Democratic Party for lacking a progressive message and failing to address the needs of working-class people, suggesting their focus on the status quo doesn't resonate with voters. He argues that the Democrats' credibility is low, and they need to take on the billionaire class and advocate for policies like healthcare for all and tuition-free public colleges. Sanders also points out the dangers of Trump's authoritarian tendencies but emphasizes the need to address the economic realities that have been worsening for decades. His vision includes creating jobs, transforming the energy system, and building affordable housing, highlighting a stark contrast to the current Democratic strategy.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has successfully entered a 3:1 resonant orbit, synchronizing with the Earth and moon's motion, which is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure. However, the claim that it is the first spacecraft to achieve this feat has been challenged by experts in the US and Canada. They point to NASA‚Äôs Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The debate centers on whether Tiandu-1 can definitively claim the title, given IBEX's near-identical achievement, highlighting the competitive nature of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center in Mombetsu, Hokkaido, focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating injured seals while maintaining emotional distance to ease the pain of releasing them back into the wild. Staff members avoid naming or having direct contact with the seals to prevent forming strong attachments, though they still develop affection for the animals. The center has rescued over 200 seals since its establishment, addressing both injuries from fishing nets and malnutrition in pups. Despite the challenges, the center aims to educate the public about seal conservation and the importance of protecting their environment, which is threatened by global warming and the recession of drift ice.</p>
