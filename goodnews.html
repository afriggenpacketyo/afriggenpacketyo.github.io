          <p>The Trump administration initially revoked Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, but later granted a 30-day extension for the university to challenge the decision.  The revocation was reportedly due to Harvard's refusal to comply with information requests and its perceived hostile campus environment towards Jewish students. A judge intends to issue a preliminary injunction maintaining the status quo, protecting international students.</p>
