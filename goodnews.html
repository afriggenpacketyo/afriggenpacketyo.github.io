          <p>Former Disney star Christy Carlson Romano recounted a harrowing incident where she was struck by birdshot during a clay pigeon shooting outing with her husband. The actress, known for "Even Stevens" and "Kim Possible," revealed she was hit in five places, including below her eye, and narrowly avoided blindness or death. Romano emphasized the importance of gun safety and described her initial shock and fears for her children. Despite the trauma, she maintained a brave face and made jokes at the hospital, though she admitted it has been difficult to accept being a "gunshot survivor."</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are working to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring modest offices and proper meal receipts as inspectors conduct checks. This campaign, running since 2012, aims to improve the Communist Party's image, combat corruption, and reduce wasteful spending. Analysts suggest the measures also ensure resources are spent wisely to compete with the United States. The effectiveness of the campaign is questioned due to media control and the difficulty of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>
