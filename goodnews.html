          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate surprisingly fell to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time. This unexpected decrease has bolstered expectations that the ECB may implement another interest rate cut in September. However, economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices could still pose risks to this disinflationary trend. The data provides a positive signal for the eurozone's economic stability, though external factors remain a concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder James Wood made baseball history by being intentionally walked four times in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels. This rare occurrence was last seen in 2004 with Barry Bonds, placing Wood in an elite group of players who have received such treatment. Despite the walks, Wood managed a hit and a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings. The event highlights Wood's formidable presence at the plate and his growing reputation as one of the sport's most feared hitters.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine showed a stronger immune response and was 26.6% more effective than an existing shot in a late-stage trial. These positive results pave the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and its combination Covid-flu shot later this year. The company voluntarily withdrew its application for the combo shot in May pending this data, following discussions with the FDA. The successful trial is a significant step for Moderna, positioning it as a front-runner in the race to market a combined vaccine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by historian Greg Grandin, "America, Am√©rica," suggests the U.S. could learn from Latin America's democratic traditions, particularly in an era of rising authoritarianism. The article reviews how Latin American independence movements and constitutions often prioritized collective social good and universal rights, sometimes more robustly than their U.S. counterparts. For example, many Latin American republics linked independence to the abolition of slavery and enshrined social welfare provisions in their founding documents. The book argues these ideals offer a valuable counter-narrative to the U.S. model and a potential path forward against modern strongman politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Understanding a dog's experience of the world requires appreciating that their primary sense is smell, according to Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. She explains that dogs construct their reality through scent, which is fundamentally different from the visual world humans inhabit. For dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that create a transient, constantly changing map of their environment. This olfactory perception even shapes their sense of time, as the fading scent of a person allows them to perceive how long someone has been gone.</p>
