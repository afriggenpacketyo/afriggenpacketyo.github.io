          <p>A new review estimates that assisted deaths in England and Wales could surpass 4,000 within ten years of the law's implementation, contingent on parliamentary approval. The official impact assessment, intended to inform MPs, anticipates a gradual increase from an initial 164-787 cases in the first half-year to 1,042-4,559 in the tenth year, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. Even at the upper estimate, assisted deaths would remain below 1% of all deaths, according to the assessment. The bill is scheduled to return to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote expected in mid-June, determining its fate. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong facing his first major test against a revitalized opposition. The election serves as an indicator of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has governed since 1965, and Wong's leadership in his first year. Voters are concerned about rising living costs and housing availability, while the opposition Workers' Party (WP) argues the government hasn't addressed these issues adequately. The PAP emphasizes its efforts to help citizens cope with rising costs through various financial aid programs. A strong PAP showing would solidify Wong's leadership and the party's dominance in Singapore for the next decade. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election to decide who will address inflation, the housing crisis, and relations with the US, according to the New York Times article. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton agree on the challenging environment, with Australia dependent on the US for security but reliant on trade with China. Voters are primarily concerned about the cost of living and housing affordability. While polls suggest Albanese's party may secure a second term, dissatisfaction with both major parties is growing, with voters turning to independent candidates and minor parties.

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, according to a BBC article. Antibodies in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various venomous snake species in animal tests. This research could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the 140,000 deaths and numerous disabilities caused by snakebites annually. Friede's motivation stemmed from a desire to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, pushing himself to endure over 200 bites and 700 venom injections. Optimism score: 80</p>
