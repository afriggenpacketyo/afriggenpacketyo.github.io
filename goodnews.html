        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been paused by a High Court injunction sought by two Chagossian women. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was scheduled to attend a virtual signing ceremony with Mauritian government representatives, where the UK would cede the islands but retain use of an airbase. The court order prevents the UK from taking conclusive steps to transfer the territory or bind itself to specific terms, ensuring UK jurisdiction remains until further notice. A government spokesperson declined to comment on the ongoing legal case, affirming the deal's importance for protecting British people and national security.</p>

          <p>Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the Taiwanese heavy metal band Chthonic, has been appointed as Taiwan's envoy to Finland, a country known for having the most metal bands per capita. This appointment is based not only on Lim's musical fame, but also on his human rights work and international exchange experience, including his service as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Lim's band, Chthonic, has used its music to call attention to Taiwan's struggles for international recognition. While some opposition legislators have expressed doubts, Lim's appointment is seen as a strategic move to strengthen ties between Taiwan and Finland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching ¬£20.2bn, a ¬£1bn increase from the previous year, according to official figures. This marks the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since 1993, driven by increased government expenditure due to pay rises, inflation, and higher pension costs. Tax receipts also rose, partly due to increased National Insurance contributions, but overall borrowing for the financial year ending in March is estimated at ¬£148.3bn, still exceeding the government's independent forecaster's expectations.</p>

          <p>China has called on the European Union to provide a fair playing field for businesses after the EU proposed a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms.

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This price rise occurs despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially indicating investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Adding to the positive sentiment, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a known bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to purchase the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>
