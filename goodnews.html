          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has announced a major policy proposal for the upcoming Welsh Parliament election, promising free childcare for all children aged nine months to four years. The plan aims to provide at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031, a move described as transformative for families struggling with living costs. Positioning his party as a replacement for the long-governing Labour party, ap Iorwerth argued that this universal offer would be the most generous in the UK and would help boost the Welsh economy. The proposal is part of a broader strategy to present Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, capable of addressing key issues and stopping the rise of Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, dedicated her award in part to former President Donald Trump for his support of her democratic efforts. This acknowledgment came shortly after the White House criticized the Nobel Committee for not selecting Trump, claiming the decision prioritized politics over peace. Machado emphasized that her cause depends on allies like Trump, creating an unusual dynamic where the prize winner praised the very person whose administration felt snubbed. Trump has long maintained that he deserves the prize for his foreign policy actions, including what he claims is ending multiple wars.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump has announced that eight Ukrainian children, who had been taken by Russia, have been successfully reunited with their families. This development follows her direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which began with a letter she hand-delivered via her husband. She stated that an "open channel of communication" was established, leading to cooperation on the welfare of these children. The issue of Russia's forced transfer of Ukrainian children has been widely condemned internationally and resulted in a war crimes arrest warrant for Putin from the International Criminal Court. This marks a rare diplomatic intervention on her part regarding the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Praises Trump's Role in Brokering Gaza Ceasefire but Criticizes Delay</h2>

          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist Jonathan Freedland credits Donald Trump for leveraging U.S. influence to secure the recent Gaza ceasefire deal, compelling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept terms he previously rejected. The analysis suggests Trump's decisive action, motivated partly by a personal affront and a desire for a Nobel Prize, was the key to breaking the stalemate. However, the article heavily criticizes both Trump and Netanyahu for not achieving this outcome much earlier, arguing that a similar deal was possible months ago. This delay resulted in immense loss of life and suffering in Gaza, as well as prolonged captivity for Israeli hostages, casting a shadow over the recent diplomatic success.</p>

          <p>Maria Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her persistent efforts to promote democracy and a peaceful transition of power in her country. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as a unifying figure who has remained in Venezuela despite facing significant personal threats. Machado, who has been forced into hiding, has been a central figure in the opposition against President Nicolás Maduro's autocratic rule. Her win is seen as a major recognition of the Venezuelan people's struggle for freedom and has drawn renewed global attention to the nation's ongoing political and humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is adjusting its portfolio by taking profits on BlackRock shares, which have recently surged to near all-time highs. The fund is selling a portion of its holdings in the asset manager to maintain discipline and reallocate capital. Concurrently, the Trust is buying shares of Boeing and Nike, capitalizing on recent price drops in both companies. The article notes that while concerns about a Turkish Airlines order impacted Boeing, the bigger market pressure comes from Trump's renewed tariff threats against China, which could present a buying opportunity for names like Nike if the threats do not materialize into action.

This development underscores the strengthening military and diplomatic ties between the Trump administration and Qatar.

          <p>A recent surge in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin, has created approximately 70,000 new millionaires over the last year, bringing the global total to over 240,000. According to a new report, this boom has added hundreds of billions in potential spending power to the economy, with crypto investors spending about 9.7 cents for every dollar of wealth gained. This spending is primarily directed towards restaurants, entertainment, and real estate rather than luxury goods. As crypto assets become more mainstream, financial experts anticipate that increased access to crypto-backed lending will further accelerate spending from this new class of wealthy, younger investors.

Cohen expressed hope but noted the uncertainty surrounding his son's condition after such a long period in captivity. He also directed strong criticism at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of obstructing previous deals and only agreeing to the current plan after being pressured by President Trump, a claim Netanyahu's office denies.</p>

          <p>Following the dismissal of manager Russell Martin, Scottish football club Rangers is reportedly in discussions with former head coach Steven Gerrard about a possible return. Gerrard, who previously led the club to a historic league title, has recently spoken of having "unfinished business" in management. His first tenure at Ibrox was marked by a celebrated unbeaten league season that ended a decade-long title drought for the club. While his subsequent managerial stints at Aston Villa and in Saudi Arabia were less successful, his past achievements with Rangers make him a leading candidate for the board, which is conducting a formal recruitment process.</p>
