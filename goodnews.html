          <p>Everton's women's team will be moving to Goodison Park after the club decided against demolishing the 132-year-old stadium. The club's original plans included an ¬£82m post-demolition renovation project for housing, a care home, retail units, and a park. After being taken over by The Friedkin Group, a feasibility study led to the decision to maintain the stadium for the women's team, with Goodison Park becoming the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the country with a capacity of 39,572. This move aims to boost the team's performance and provide economic opportunities for local businesses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced Saudi Arabia's commitment to invest $600 billion in a series of deals with the United States, following a visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A key agreement is a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing the kingdom with state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms, nearly double Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget. The White House's announcement did not specify when the defense deal is expected to conclude. Trump participated at a U.S.-Saudi investment forum in Riyadh.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is implementing organizational changes by laying off 3% of its employees across all levels, teams, and geographies. The company stated that these changes are necessary to best position it for success in a dynamic marketplace.

This is likely Microsoft's largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023, and the spokesperson said these new job cuts are not related to performance.</p>

          <p>Following the first set of talks since President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs, both Beijing and Washington claimed victory after the removal of most of the steep import duties. However, analysts suggest that Beijing emerged with the upper hand, consolidating its status as a credible global counterweight to Washington. China entered the negotiations from a position of strength, having learned from dealing with Trump during his first term. The real significance lies in the performative dimension of power projection, which could prove more valuable over the long term than immediate economic gains.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's plan to restructure in a format that allows its non-profit entity to retain ultimate control has received the endorsement of SoftBank, one of the U.S. artificial intelligence startup's biggest backers.

Microsoft, another major investor, has yet to approve the restructure, and is reportedly rewriting the terms of their partnership with OpenAI. The non-profit arm will retain control of the company, while the limited liability company will turn into a public benefit corporation.</p>

          <p>Following Trump's 2016 victory, Democrats blamed "neoliberal" economic policies for his rise, leading to Biden's "Bidenomics," which emphasized government intervention. However, Trump's 2024 restoration has sparked a debate over whether Biden's policies failed. Critics argue that Bidenomics caused inflation and failed to help the working class, while defenders point to investment successes and political resilience. The debate centers on whether Democrats lost in 2024 despite or because of Biden's post-neoliberal approach. The article suggests that a balance between market efficiency and political realities is needed.</p>

GM anticipates being first to market with this technology, following Ford Motor's earlier announcement of similar LMR batteries, and this move aims to improve the range, safety, and charging capabilities of EVs.</p>

          <p>With retirement approaching, homeowners can leverage their home equity in several ways. Options include taking out a HELOC as a financial safety net, downsizing and investing the proceeds, refinancing the mortgage to take cash out, or using a reverse mortgage to create steady income. Each strategy has its own advantages and drawbacks, such as variable interest rates with HELOCs or the potential for foreclosure with reverse mortgages.
