          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang recently met with US business, academic, and civic leaders in New York, appealing for their help in improving troubled trade relations between the two economic giants. During the private meeting, held alongside the UN General Assembly, Li stressed that stable bilateral development requires both governments to cooperate. This diplomatic effort occurs amidst heightened tensions, including significant US tariffs on Chinese imports and restrictions on investments and student visas, which have considerably frayed economic ties. Li's outreach seeks to foster stronger economic bonds, highlighting the importance of collaboration to navigate current geopolitical friction and ensure mutual prosperity.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve claims of tricking millions into Prime memberships and making cancellations difficult. The agreement allocates $1.5 billion for customer refunds and imposes a $1 billion civil penalty, representing the largest such penalty in FTC history. Amazon maintains it has always adhered to the law, viewing the settlement as a path to move forward. This article underscores a significant victory for the FTC in combating deceptive subscription practices and protecting consumers, with an estimated 35 million US customers potentially eligible for refunds and new requirements for Amazon to simplify enrollment and cancellation processes.</p>

          <p>This article details the reduced monthly costs for a $40,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Borrowers can now expect monthly payments between approximately $379 and $483, depending on a 10- or 15-year term, which is significantly less expensive than earlier in 2025 or last fall. The analysis also highlights the option for interest-only payments during the draw period, offering even cheaper initial expenses. With further rate cuts anticipated in the coming months, HELOCs are presented as a more affordable financing option for homeowners, who can benefit from the variable rates without needing to refinance.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments, ending paper checks for nearly 70 million recipients starting September 30. This move, mandated by a Trump executive order, aims to modernize services, improve efficiency, and enhance security, as paper checks are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. While most beneficiaries already use direct deposit or prepaid debit cards, the SSA has been notifying the remaining recipients. This article highlights the cost-saving benefits and increased security, though concerns remain for "unbanked" individuals who may struggle with the transition, despite the agency confirming exceptions for those with no other payment options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the legacy of Allen Ginsberg, portraying him as a quintessential American "poet-buffoon" – a figure of swashbuckling vulnerability, ridiculous and unstoppable, friend to the dispossessed, personal frequenter of the edge of things, orating and chanting and moaning in ecstasy and getting himself arrested. It explores his contributions through an Atlantic archive lens, referencing his pro-marijuana essay, "The Great Marijuana Hoax," and the cultural impact of his Beat Generation presence, which influenced movements like Calcutta's "Hangries." The article also touches upon his complex yet generous relationship with his poet father, Louis Ginsberg, whose modest verse contrasted sharply with Allen's mighty "Howl." It frames Ginsberg's work as a powerful, ecstatic expression that challenged societal norms and fostered anti-establishment sentiments.</p>

However, Ukrainian politicians like Oleksiy Honcharenko caution against over-optimism, interpreting Trump's words as a desire to retreat from direct involvement rather than offer concrete aid.
