          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to return as a pitcher on Tuesday against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB pitching appearance since August 2023. This comeback follows right elbow surgery and an initial expectation for his return after the All-Star break. However, injuries to the Dodgers' bullpen accelerated his return, and Ohtani is expected to pitch short innings at Dodger Stadium. Ohtani demonstrated strong batting performance on Sunday, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a win against the San Francisco Giants, adding to the anticipation for his pitching return. The article highlights Ohtani's eagerness and the team's strategic approach to his comeback. </p>

          <p>Shares of Santos experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group.

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, barring a superior proposal. This bid follows previous unsuccessful takeover attempts and highlights Santos' attractiveness, particularly among Middle Eastern players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to protect key systems and sensitive data amidst growing threats from state-backed hackers. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers, while companies are obligated to report cyberattacks. The government plans a new cybersecurity strategy by year-end to implement a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027. With infrastructure largely run by private firms, the government emphasizes the importance of public-private cooperation in safeguarding against cyber threats. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies aimed at boosting consumption. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, exceeding analysts' expectations, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment also showed slower growth, and property investment continued to contract. While improving consumption offers a respite for China's economy, challenges remain, including falling property prices that could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites.

The crackdown follows media reports of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, leading to an estimated 3 million people in Japan gambling online. The government plans to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites. </p>

Delap, who recently moved from Ipswich Town for ¬£30m, is eager to make a strong impression and compete with Nicolas Jackson for a starting spot. Maresca, who coached Delap at Manchester City's academy, believes Delap is relaxed and ready to contribute, dismissing concerns about the supposed curse of the Chelsea number 9 shirt. Chelsea also intends to sign another winger after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United. </p>
