          <h2>Senator Graham Pushes Forward with Trump Border Funding Despite Objections</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Lindsey Graham is advancing efforts to fund President Trump's border security agenda, despite opposition from Senator Rand Paul, who seeks to halve the proposed spending. Graham, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, defends the $128.4 billion bill, arguing it fully funds the President's plan, including border wall construction, increased ICE detention capacity, and more Border Patrol agents. Paul argues that the funding could be drastically reduced, leading to a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans led by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller to justify the price tag. The bill closely mirrors the House GOP's version, but faces potential changes in the Senate; the optimism score reflects the ongoing debate over border security funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his support for Chinese students studying in the United States, pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This stance appears to contrast with previous initiatives from his administration aimed at limiting international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized that having Chinese students in the US is beneficial for both the students and American schools and companies. He expressed a desire for these graduates to be hired by American companies, noting that if they are not allowed to stay, they may return to their home countries and start businesses there; the optimism score reflects the potential for international collaboration and exchange.</p>
