          <p>A progressive congressional staffer argues that Democrats should focus on persuasion and finding common ground with a broader audience, rather than creating a left-wing echo chamber. The author recounts an interview between a progressive congressman and conservative media host Glenn Beck, highlighting their surprising agreement on some issues. Democrats are encouraged to engage with diverse media outlets and tailor their message to different audiences without compromising their values. The piece emphasizes the need for Democrats to be fearless in reaching people where they are and persuading them of shared goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, focusing on attunement to a child's emotional needs. This style emphasizes building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, view "bad" behavior as a signal for help, and take responsibility after conflicts. By doing their own inner work, they create an environment where their child feels safe expressing themselves and showing up as their full, authentic self.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but the story was his truck getting repossessed due to missed payments after he changed banks. Paul had forgotten to update his automatic payments for his Ford F-150, leading to it being towed away in the middle of the night. After finding out through his trainer checking security footage, he posted the incident on social media with a Celine Dion soundtrack, and he has since regained possession of the vehicle. The win and the repossession story added an unexpected twist to his tournament experience.</p>
