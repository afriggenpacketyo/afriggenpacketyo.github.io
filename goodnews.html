          <p>Rivian Automotive is adjusting its 2025 delivery targets downward, now expecting to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 units, and increasing its capital expenditure guidance to $1.8 to $1.9 billion. This adjustment comes amidst concerns about the global trade and economic environment, particularly evolving trade regulations, policies, and tariffs under President Trump, impacting consumer sentiment and demand. Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year and anticipates adjusted losses before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. The company reported a better-than-expected first quarter, achieving its second consecutive quarter of gross profit and ending the quarter with $8.5 billion in liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, with overall sales surging by 36%. The company's revenue reached $7.44 billion, surpassing the anticipated $7.13 billion, and adjusted earnings per share came in at 96 cents, slightly above the expected 94 cents. AMD's data center segment, which includes server CPUs and GPUs, experienced a 57% increase in sales, driven by strong demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs used in AI applications. The company's forecast for the current quarter includes approximately $7.4 billion in sales, with a gross margin of 43%, although it also anticipates incurring $800 million in costs due to U.S. export controls on some AI chips.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, aiming to assert Canada's sovereignty amid ongoing tensions over trade and border issues, according to this New York Times article. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" in response to Trump's repeated suggestions of acquiring the country. Despite Trump's earlier criticisms of Canada's dependence on the U.S., the meeting struck a more conciliatory tone, with Trump praising Carney's election victory. The discussions, however, did not yield breakthroughs on key issues like tariffs, with Trump indicating no immediate policy changes, although both leaders agreed to continue talks and address global concerns of common interest.</p>

          <p>In an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" in response to Trump's suggestion of the U.S. acquiring the country, according to this CBS News article. Trump romanticized the idea of Canada joining the U.S., but Carney emphasized the importance of partnership rather than acquisition. Despite Carney's rejection, Trump did not completely dismiss the idea, saying, "never say never." The meeting also addressed trade tensions, with Carney requesting Trump to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state.</p>

          <p>The BBC has announced plans to create a 'Call the Midwife' film and a prequel TV series set during World War II, expanding the popular drama that follows nurse midwives in London's East End, according to this BBC article. The film will take the existing characters to an undisclosed overseas location in 1972, while the prequel series will explore life in Poplar during the Blitz. Showrunner Heidi Thomas noted that the prequel series will feature familiar faces, though much younger, and the film's location is being kept secret, but will look "absolutely fantastic" on the big screen.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat analyzes the portrayal of the rich in American television, contrasting aspirational, judgmental, and reassuring spirits, in this New York Times opinion piece. He focuses on "Your Friends & Neighbors," an Apple TV show, which uniquely eliminates aspirational elements, depicting affluent characters in leafy Connecticut as unhappy and financially insecure, despite their wealth. Douthat contrasts this with shows like "Mad Men," where characters, despite personal problems, inhabit a more stylish and enviable world. The author questions whether this bleak portrayal is an accurate reflection of the contemporary rich, suggesting it may be an overdetermined and less convincing view compared to more aspirational depictions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction against President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums, according to this NPR article. The injunction, issued by District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr., states that Trump's executive order violated the Administrative Procedure Act and disregarded the constitutional role of Congress in making laws and appropriating funds. The IMLS, established by Congress in 1996, is the main source of federal funding for public libraries, particularly benefiting small and rural libraries through its Grants to States program.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sheds light on the use of psychoactive drugs in exclusive rituals by the ancient Chav√≠n people of the Peruvian Andes, according to this CBS News article. Archaeologists discovered artifacts at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including snuff tubes containing traces of hallucinogenic substance dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and plants related to tobacco. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found suggests that only certain members of the Chav√≠n society were invited to partake in these rituals, which may have played a role in establishing social and political hierarchies.</p>

Those without REAL ID may be diverted to a different line and face an extra step.

          <p>Randi Weingarten argues for a shift in America's approach to education, advocating for multiple pathways beyond the traditional four-year college route, in this New York Times guest essay. With a significant percentage of high schoolers not enrolling or completing college, Weingarten proposes aligning high school to both college prep and in-demand vocational career pathways. She highlights successful programs, such as the Brooklyn STEAM Center and the Red Hawks Rising Teacher Academy, that provide students with relevant coursework and career opportunities. She contrasts this approach with the Trump administration's proposed cuts to K-12 education and Republican-led states' embrace of school vouchers.</p>
