          <h2>Tesla Sales Rebound in Norway Despite European Lag Amidst Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 10:41:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway experienced a significant surge, increasing by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a declining trend in Europe. The sales boost was largely attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which is favored for its value and suitability for Norwegian needs such as luggage space and all-wheel drive. However, a survey indicated that a substantial percentage of EV drivers would not consider purchasing a Tesla due to political reasons related to Elon Musk's activities and rhetoric, which have damaged the brand's reputation in Europe. Despite this, Norway's strong EV incentives and infrastructure continue to support Tesla's sales, making it a leader in sustainable transportation. The initial deliveries of the revamped Model Y SUV contributed to the sales rebound, suggesting pent-up demand for the new edition.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer's chief executive, Stuart Machin, saw his yearly pay increase to ¬£7 million, primarily due to share awards resulting from the company reaching performance targets, including profit growth. This increase occurred before a cyber attack impacted the retailer's online orders and contactless payments, potentially costing the company ¬£300 million in profits this year. While M&S expects insurance to cover some of the financial impact, online service disruptions are expected to continue into July, and the remuneration committee said it would revisit the matter when deciding on next year's compensation. Despite the cyber incident, M&S is accelerating its digital transformation plans to reinforce cyber defenses and improve resilience against future attacks.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill could bring four major changes for student loan borrowers, including fewer repayment plans, new borrowing limits, removal of deferment and forbearance options, and limits on future changes to repayment. Future borrowers may only have two repayment options: an updated standard repayment plan and a new income-based plan known as the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Undergraduates will have a borrowing cap of $50,000, while graduate borrowers will have caps of $100,000 or $150,000 for professional programs. The proposal also eliminates subsidized loans and reduces options for deferment and forbearance, potentially impacting borrowers facing economic hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has ruled that rejecting asylum seekers at Germany's borders without following the EU's Dublin procedure is unlawful, challenging a new federal migration policy. The ruling came in response to the case of three Somali nationals who were turned back to Poland under a new German regulation. The court stated that such rejections bypass necessary legal steps and violate asylum rights. This decision is a setback for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's pledge to crack down on migration, as it emphasizes the need to adhere to the Dublin system for processing asylum claims.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to remodel flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and increased flight capacity for passengers. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established 70 years ago, starting with the complex airspace around London, although changes are not expected for several years. The government says the plans could allow planes to climb quicker and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts and paving the way for new technologies. However, environmental groups warn that redesigning flight paths could expose more communities to noise and air pollution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new international study has found that colon cancer patients who participated in a three-year exercise program experienced improved survival rates, with the benefits comparable to some drug treatments. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, showed that a structured exercise program reduced cancer recurrences by 28% and deaths from any cause by 37%. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a standard of care for colon cancer survivors, as the intervention is affordable and can significantly improve patient outcomes. The study provides high-quality evidence that exercise can directly improve survival in colon cancer patients, giving them a reason to stay motivated.</p>

          <p>Lending experts recommend homeowners consider home equity loans and HELOCs as cost-effective borrowing options, particularly for consolidating debt or funding renovations, due to lower interest rates compared to credit cards and personal loans. They advise locking in promotional rates for short-term needs, shopping for low or no-fee deals, and prioritizing high-ROI home improvements. Experts also suggest that setting up a HELOC now could be a smart move for future expenses, as expected Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead to lower rates over time. Responsible use of home equity can build wealth and increase financial flexibility, but it is essential to compare rates, fees, and terms from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>
