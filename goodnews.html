          <p>Zookeepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, UK, are celebrating what they call one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom after a female casque-headed iguana gave birth to eight healthy hatchlings without ever mating. This phenomenon, known as parthenogenesis, allows an unfertilized egg to develop into an embryo, creating genetic clones of the mother. The zoo's director, Scott Adams, expressed astonishment at the fertile eggs and highlighted the event as a powerful educational opportunity about genetics and evolution. The hatchlings are currently in a controlled nursery and will soon be on public display.</p>

          <p>The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the UAE has released a new, low-cost AI reasoning model named K2 Think, positioning it as a challenger to systems from OpenAI and China's DeepSeek. Developed with AI firm G42 and built on Alibaba's open-source model, K2 Think is significantly smaller than its competitors but claims to deliver comparable performance in math, science, and coding benchmarks. This development highlights the UAE's ambition to become a global AI leader and demonstrates that powerful AI systems can be created with greater efficiency and fewer resources, potentially democratizing access to advanced technology.</p>

A CBRE analysis shows the AI-skilled tech workforce grew over 50% in the past year, with concentrations in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Seattle. This influx of high-earning talent is driving up demand for both office space and residential rentals, as AI development often requires in-office collaboration. Consequently, apartment rents have increased in all top AI tech markets, with Manhattan and Washington, D.C. seeing double-digit growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial advice column addresses the dilemma of a 40-year-old individual going through a divorce who needs $70,000 to buy out their ex-spouse's share of the family home. The article weighs the pros and cons of taking out a personal loan versus withdrawing funds from a 401(k) retirement account. While a loan preserves retirement savings, it comes with high interest rates and new monthly debt. Dipping into a 401(k) avoids immediate debt but sacrifices long-term compound growth and may incur penalties. The piece also suggests alternative solutions like negotiating a payment plan or making other concessions in the divorce settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michael Clune, author of the heroin addiction memoir 'White Out,' has released a new novel titled 'Pan,' which delves into the subjective experience of adolescent anxiety. The book's narrator, a teenager named Nicholas, experiences debilitating panic attacks that he comes to interpret not as a medical condition but as an encounter with the mischievous Greek god Pan. The novel vividly portrays the physical and perceptual distortions of panic, describing it as an "excess of consciousness." Rather than a standard recovery narrative, the book is a philosophical and metaphysical exploration of finding meaning and insight within the terrifying experience of anxiety.</p>

          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers still face rates significantly higher than those seen during the pandemic. This article outlines several key strategies for securing better loan terms. Experts advise improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, as higher FICO scores qualify for better rates. Making a larger down payment of 20% or more can also lead to a lower rate and avoids private mortgage insurance. Finally, borrowers are encouraged to consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which offers a lower initial rate. (not investment advice)</p>

However, foreign policy experts assert that this is not a full pivot away from Washington but rather a policy of "multi-alignment" designed to maintain strategic autonomy. While the U.S. remains an indispensable partner for India, New Delhi is hedging its bets to navigate an increasingly volatile global landscape and leverage relationships across competing blocs.</p>
