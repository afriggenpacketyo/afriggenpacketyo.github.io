          <p>Humans triumphed over generative AI models from Google and OpenAI at the International Mathematical Olympiad, with five young participants achieving perfect scores compared to the AI models' gold-level performance. While the AI models, including Google's Gemini chatbot and OpenAI's experimental reasoning model, reached a significant milestone by earning gold-level scores for the first time, they did not achieve full marks. This development highlights the rapid improvement of AI in complex problem-solving, with Google's model solving problems within the 4.5-hour time limit this year, a significant leap from previous attempts. The event prompts reflection on the accelerating pace of AI development and its potential future capabilities.</p>

          <p>During a "Malicious Monster Truck Tour" event in Bremerton, Washington, a wheel detached from a monster truck, bouncing out of the arena and crushing several parked cars. Fortunately, the tour confirmed that no one was injured in the incident, though significant property damage occurred. The tour organizers stated the truck used industry-standard restraints and acknowledged the unpredictable nature of motorsports, committing to future safety enhancements and transparency. Video footage captured the dramatic event, showing no fans were in the wheel's path, but the incident highlights inherent risks in such competitions and the need for continuous safety improvements.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child was attacked by a mountain lion while hiking with family in Washington state's Olympic National Park, but was heroically saved by their father who pulled the child from the animal's jaws. Emergency crews airlifted the injured child to a Seattle trauma center, where their condition was later listed as satisfactory. Park rangers tracked and euthanized the collared cougar the following morning, ensuring no ongoing danger to visitors. Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare in North America, with only two fatalities in Washington state over the past century, making this a remarkable survival story.</p>

          <p>This article highlights two inspiring individuals dedicated to helping others. Brian Flynn became a rare double living organ donor, saving two lives by donating a kidney to a stranger and part of his liver to a four-year-old child. His selfless acts gave his life profound meaning and he now advocates for donation. Separately, Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 13, invented "Infusion Hero," a zippered sweatshirt for patients receiving infusions, to address discomfort during treatments. Her innovation, born from personal experience, aims to provide comfort and purpose, demonstrating how challenges can spark solutions for wider benefit.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Credit Card Grace Periods and Late Payment Implications</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many credit cards offer a grace period on new purchases, typically 21-25 days, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their full balance by the due date. However, this grace period often disappears if a balance is carried over from the previous month. Crucially, there is generally no formal grace period for late payments; missing a due date can immediately incur late fees, penalty APRs, and damage to credit scores after 30 days. The article advises contacting the credit card company immediately if a payment will be late, making a partial payment, and exploring debt relief options for consistent struggles.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates but revealed a $1.1 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs, contributing to a 7% drop in shares. Despite this, GM affirmed its full-year guidance, with CEO Mary Barra stating efforts are underway to "greatly reduce" tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The company anticipates slower demand for electric vehicles after the September 30 expiration of federal tax credits, but expects minimal impact on 2025 results. GM also noted it has become the second-largest EV manufacturer in the U.S., focusing on EV profitability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard University study, analyzing 58,007 women's birthing records, suggests that the odds of having a boy or girl are not always 50/50, but rather follow a "weighted coin toss" within families. Researchers found that if a family's first two children are of the same sex, the likelihood of subsequent children also being that sex increases. For instance, families with three boys had a 61% chance of a fourth boy, and those with three girls had a 58% chance of a fourth girl. While the exact mechanisms are unclear, maternal age at first birth was identified as a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate startup Opendoor Technologies and department store Kohl's have experienced significant volatility and surges, signaling a renewed meme stock rally. Opendoor's stock tripled in days, fueled by retail traders on forums like WallStreetBets and a hedge fund manager's bullish tout. High short interest in both Opendoor (22%) and Kohl's (50%) suggests short-covering contributed to the rapid price increases, as investors buy back shares to limit losses. Heightened options trading also intensified the rally, demonstrating how concentrated retail interest can drive extreme market moves for heavily shorted companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that the increasing prevalence of AI-generated content, or "AI slop," on the internet is degrading the online experience, potentially pushing people towards a digital detox. As AI content becomes indistinguishable from reality and infiltrates various platforms, it erodes trust and makes online interactions less authentic. While some users may become more addicted to AI-mediated experiences, the author suggests that skeptics will increasingly turn to the real world for genuine connections, reliable information, and less commodified experiences. This shift could lead to a reorientation towards physical media and in-person interactions, fostering a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace Football Club has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against UEFA's decision to demote them from the Europa League to the Conference League. The punishment stems from alleged breaches of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor holds stakes in both Crystal Palace and Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. UEFA rules prohibit clubs influenced by the same entity from competing in the same European competition, a deadline Palace reportedly missed. The club argues Textor lacks decisive influence, and its chairman expressed strong optimism that the decision will be overturned, aiming for readmission to the Europa League.</p>

The current 90-day suspension of tariffs, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. Bessent described trade relations with China as being in a "very good place," indicating constructive discussions. Beyond tariffs, the US aims to address China's manufacturing glut and encourage a consumer-driven economy, as well as their purchases of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. This expected extension signals continued negotiations and a more settled trade environment between the two economic powers.</p>
