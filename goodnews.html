          <h2>WeightWatchers Faces Bankruptcy Amid Popularity of Weight Loss Injections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 13:23:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the United States due to significant debt and increased competition from weight loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The bankruptcy process aims to eliminate $1.15 billion of the company's debt while establishing new repayment terms with lenders. Despite the financial restructuring, WeightWatchers assures its members that it will remain fully operational and there will be no impact on their services. The company attributes its financial challenges to the rapidly changing landscape of weight management, driven by the growing popularity of weight loss injections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Used vehicle prices have experienced a significant increase, reaching levels not seen since October 2023, driven by consumer concerns over potential price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, which tracks used vehicle prices at U.S. wholesale auctions, rose by 4.9% compared to the previous year. This increase also represents a 2.7% rise from March, significantly higher than the typical month-to-month increase. According to Cox Automotive, the 'spring bounce' in prices extended throughout April, reflecting strong price appreciation in anticipation of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A Kentucky mom, Holly LaFavers, was surprised to find a $4,200 charge on her bank account after her eight-year-old son, Liam, ordered 70,000 Dum-Dum lollipops on her Amazon account. Liam, who has fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, intended to host a carnival for his friends and use the candy as prizes. After initially facing difficulty with Amazon, LaFavers turned to social media, where her community helped her distribute the lollipops, and Amazon eventually refunded her money, resolving the sticky situation.</p>

          <p>The cities of Salt Lake City and Boise have approved new official city flags, including the rainbow Pride flag, in response to state laws restricting the display of unofficial flags on government property. These laws were perceived by civil rights groups as attempts to suppress flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people. Salt Lake City approved flags featuring the rainbow Pride colors, the transgender Pride colors, and a symbol for Juneteenth. Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official city flags.</p>

Despite warnings of potential delays, the rollout appeared to be relatively smooth, with many travelers prepared for the new requirements.

          <p>A federal appeals court ordered the Trump administration to comply with a lower court order to transfer Tufts Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont. Ozturk, who was arrested after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, is challenging her detention. The court's decision requires the Trump administration to transfer Ozturk within one week, allowing her access to legal and medical services. The Department of Homeland Security accused her of engaging 'in activities in support of Hamas,' though her lawyers say she's being held in violation of her free speech and due process rights.</p>
