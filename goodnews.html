          <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions and a depreciating U.S. dollar, affluent investors are increasingly turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, with some doubling their allocations this year. High-net-worth individuals are exploring various investment methods, from buying fractional shares of unallocated gold bars to securing physical bullions in high-security vaults, such as converted Swiss military bunkers. Bankers note a significant uptick in interest from U.S. clients seeking to diversify their portfolios, viewing gold as a simpler alternative to complex currency investments. While some investors prefer the security of owning physical, allocated bars, financial advisors caution against at-home storage due to security risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a century-old shipwreck in the North Sea as a sanctuary to reintroduce the rare European flat oyster. Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae onto the wreckage, hoping to establish a new reef that will help restore marine biodiversity. Flat oysters, once abundant, have largely vanished from the region due to overfishing and disease. These oysters are crucial ecosystem engineers, as their reefs purify water and provide habitats for other sea life, and the protected status of the shipwreck makes it an ideal location for this pilot restoration effort.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious leader of the Los Choneros gang known as "Fito," to the United States, marking a historic first for the country. Fito, who had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine and smuggling firearms. His gang is known for its extreme violence and connections to Mexican cartels, posing a significant threat to regional stability. The extradition occurred after the U.S. provided guarantees regarding the respect of his rights, and he is scheduled to appear in a Brooklyn federal court.</p>

          <p>China is set to achieve its ambitious goal of having 50,000 kilometers of operational high-speed rail by the end of the year, according to the Minister of Transport.

This extensive network now covers 97% of Chinese cities with populations exceeding 500,000. The announcement comes as national railways report a record 2.24 billion passenger trips in the first half of 2025, an increase attributed to a growing economy and improved service quality.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the violent clashes between police and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham on June 18, 1984, and its aftermath. This includes the failed prosecution of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry, a Labour manifesto promise, aims to answer questions that have lingered for 40 years for the affected communities.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of the water sector in England and Wales has recommended a major overhaul, including the dissolution of the economic regulator, Ofwat. The independent Water Commission, established in response to public anger over sewage spills and rising bills, found systemic failures by government, companies, and regulators. A key proposal is to create a single, unified water regulator in both England and Wales to replace the current fragmented system. The review also calls for stricter controls on company owners, better pollution monitoring, and measures to manage bill increases, acknowledging that past underinvestment is now driving up costs.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles non-profit, Dog Coalition Los Angeles, is providing a unique support system for people who foster shelter dogs, creating a community that improves adoption outcomes. The volunteer-run organization carefully matches larger dogs from a city shelter with foster homes and provides ongoing support, including training classes and social events. This approach not only helps the dogs become more adoptable but also builds a network for the human participants, many of whom are new to the city or fostering. The program has successfully placed over 270 dogs, helping to alleviate pressure on the city's overcrowded shelter system.</p>

          <p>The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens is anticipating the bloom of its rare and notoriously smelly corpse flower. The massive plant, native to Indonesia, is expected to unfurl its giant inflorescence for only 24 to 48 hours, during which it will emit a powerful odor often compared to rotting flesh. This scent is a natural strategy to attract pollinators like carrion beetles. The Huntington has one of North America's largest collections of the endangered plant, using the popular bloom event as an opportunity to educate the public about plant conservation and biodiversity.</p>

          <h2>Advocates Push to Repeal Obscure 'Permanent Chassis' Rule to Boost Manufactured Housing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Housing advocates are pushing Congress to eliminate a 50-year-old federal rule requiring manufactured homes to be built on a permanent steel chassis. They argue that removing this mandate, a relic from the era of mobile trailers, could make these homes more affordable, attractive, and easier to integrate into traditional neighborhoods. The change could significantly scale up production from existing factories, offering a cost-effective solution to the housing crisis, especially for first-time buyers. After decades of legislative inertia, the proposal is gaining traction amid the worsening housing shortage, with a Senate committee expected to consider the reform soon. (not investment advice)</p>
