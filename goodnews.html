          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of ten Eurasian countries including China, Russia, and India, has officially decided to establish a new development bank. The initiative aims to provide an alternative to the US dollar-dominated trade system, thereby insulating member nations from associated financial risks. Analysts suggest the bank will also accelerate the development of key infrastructure projects within the region. The move is seen as a logical step to strengthen economic cooperation and financial stability among the participating countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The aurora borealis may be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom due to heightened solar activity from a recent coronal mass ejection. The Met Office has indicated a "decent chance" for sightings as far south as the Midlands, particularly on Monday and Tuesday nights. Visibility will depend on local conditions such as clear skies and minimal light pollution. Forecasters advise that the best viewing opportunities will be away from urban centers, with northern regions of the UK typically having the highest probability of clear views.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break records at the US Open, becoming the oldest man in the Open era to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams in a single year. However, his pursuit of a 25th Grand Slam title is shadowed by persistent questions about his physical durability. Throughout the tournament, Djokovic has required medical attention for various issues, and he has openly acknowledged the challenges of his aging body. Despite these concerns, his high level of play, particularly his serving, has carried him into the later rounds where he faces a significant challenge against Taylor Fritz.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Stable, Natural Blue Food Dye from Algae as a Safer Alternative to Synthetic Colors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 17:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Cornell University have created a heat- and light-stable blue food dye from phycocyanin, a protein found in algae. This breakthrough offers a natural alternative to petroleum-based synthetic dyes like Blue 1 and Blue 2, which have been linked to health concerns and environmental pollution. The new process creates uniform nanoparticles that retain their vibrant color while also acting as an emulsifier, potentially replacing multiple artificial additives in food products. This innovation aligns with consumer demand for cleaner, plant-based ingredients and could soon appear in grocery stores.</p>

          <p>A Polish CEO, Piotr Szczerek, has issued a public apology after a video showed him snatching a hat from a young boy at the US Open. The incident occurred when tennis player Kamil Majchrzak threw his cap into the crowd for the child, but Szczerek intercepted it. In his statement, Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed the player was throwing the hat to him and admitted he made a "huge mistake" that hurt the boy. He has since returned the hat, and the player later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>
