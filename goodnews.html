He now works as a superyacht captain, earning up to $20,000 monthly, excluding tips, and even had a stint on Bravo's "Below Deck." Ortega mentors aspiring yachties through his "Superyacht Sunday School," stressing the importance of a strong customer service personality and a humble willingness to learn, rather than extensive prior boating experience. While acknowledging the difficulties of being away from family for extended periods, he highlights the significant financial benefits and the opportunity for a more fulfilling life, urging those feeling stuck to make a change.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift in US-China relations, President Donald Trump announced that his administration would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the United States, effectively doubling the current enrollment. This declaration followed concerns from the Chinese embassy, which had advised its students to exercise caution when entering the US through Houston, citing instances of "unjustifiably questioned and harassed" individuals. Trump expressed optimism about future relations, stating his administration aimed to "get along good" with China and acknowledging an invitation from President Xi Jinping to visit. This development suggests a potential de-escalation in educational and diplomatic tensions, contrasting with previous strained interactions.</p>

South Korean companies pledged $150 billion in investments in the US, while Korean Air committed nearly $50 billion to buy aircraft from Boeing and engines from GE Aerospace. These deals build on a July trade agreement that reduced US tariffs on South Korean exports. President Donald Trump lauded the strong economic partnership, and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung expressed optimism about Korea's contribution to a manufacturing renaissance.

Beyond weight loss, new applications are emerging for conditions like psoriasis, kidney disease, and even Alzheimer's, promising significant health and productivity gains. The drugs are already impacting consumer spending, particularly in the food and beverage industry, and raising questions about socioeconomic divisions due to their high cost and limited accessibility, prompting a new era of drug innovation and market shifts.

Under his leadership alongside Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, the Sinaloa cartel evolved into the world's largest drug trafficking organization. Zambada admitted to extensive operations, including bribing Mexican police and military commanders to operate freely, and acknowledged the cartel's annual revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars. This plea, which came after prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty, ensures he will spend the rest of his life in a US federal prison, hailed as a landmark victory for US authorities in their anti-cartel crusade.</p>

Andy Pages powered the offense with two home runs, driving in four runs, while Emmet Sheehan delivered a stellar performance with a career-high seven scoreless innings and ten strikeouts. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized that the team is now in a "sprint" for the division title, with only 30 games remaining, and is receiving significant reinforcements from returning injured players. This impressive win, coupled with a series of recent shutouts, positions the Dodgers strongly as they head into the final stretch of the regular season.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has once again scrubbed the 10th test flight of its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket, with the latest delay attributed to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This marks the second consecutive delay for the crucial mission, which aims to demonstrate vital fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is essential for enabling a faster launch cadence and developing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a key requirement for NASA's ambitious moon landing mission as early as 2027. Despite SpaceX founder Elon Musk acknowledging "thousands of engineering challenges," NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic, although some experts express significant doubts about the system's readiness for a crewed moon mission by 2030.</p>

The National Hurricane Center reported that Fernand was located approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, sustaining maximum winds of 50 mph. Forecasters anticipate the storm will transition into a post-tropical cyclone before completely dissipating on Wednesday. This system represents the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had predicted would be an above-normal season. Fernand follows Hurricane Erin, the first storm this season to reach hurricane strength, which also remained over open ocean.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ruled that the state's Republican-controlled legislature drew its congressional boundaries in violation of voters' rights, necessitating a rapid redraw for the 2026 midterm elections. The current map, enacted in 2021, controversially divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold and the state's population center, among its four congressional districts, all of which have since elected Republicans by wide margins. Judge Dianna Gibson declared the map unlawful because the legislature circumvented a commission specifically established by voters to ensure districts are not drawn to favor any single party. While Republican lawmakers have promised appeals that could potentially delay the adoption of new maps until 2028, this ruling introduces significant uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the US House, potentially impacting national political control.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to US schools, reversing an abrupt freeze that prompted a multi-state lawsuit. These funds, vital for after-school and summer learning programs, teacher training, and support for English-learners, were initially withheld without a clear explanation, though a White House spokesperson suggested they were being "grossly misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda." Attorneys general from California and 22 other states, alongside two governors, accused the administration of illegally impounding congressionally allocated money, violating the Impoundment Control Act. The full restoration brings significant relief to communities and school districts, ensuring the continuation of programs benefiting approximately 1.4 million children nationwide, many from low-income families, just weeks before the school year commenced.</p>
