          <p>The United States and China have indicated that they made substantial progress during trade talks held in Geneva. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as productive and constructive, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng called them in-depth and candid. These were the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports in January, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. The talks aim to de-escalate the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets and raised fears of a global recession. A joint statement detailing the outcomes is expected to be released soon, potentially including tariff cuts.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, a Los Angeles-based company, has voluntarily recalled several of its premade food items after federal regulators found a strain of listeria on its equipment linked to an outbreak first identified last year. The recalled items, sold under the Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go, and Fresh Take Crave Away brands, were distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. The recall was prompted by a routine inspection that confirmed the listeria strain matched the one causing illnesses in the 2024 outbreak. While no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety.</p>

          <p>The offshore yuan experienced a boost in value against the US dollar as reports circulated about progress in US-China trade talks. China's central bank set the fixing rate for the onshore yuan at 7.2066 against the US dollar, compared to 7.2095 last Friday. The market is optimistic, driven by expectations of constructive outcomes from negotiations between the world's two largest economies. Both sides have indicated that the meetings yielded substantial progress, with a joint statement expected soon.

          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by tying what Medicare pays for medications administered in a doctor's office to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy seeks to ensure the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest price globally. The proposal, intended to lower healthcare costs, is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that it will hurt profits and innovation. A similar attempt during Trump's first term was blocked by court orders.</p>

NWS fly maggots can cause serious and deadly damage to animals by burrowing into their flesh. The suspension will continue on a month-to-month basis until containment is achieved.

He also suggests that the US might demand China to buy more American goods in any negotiation. Yao highlights that both sides are realizing that the current path hurts everyone, making a return to the negotiating table inevitable.</p>
