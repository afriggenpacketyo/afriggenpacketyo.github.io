          <p>The Australian women's rugby team, known as the Wallaroos, secured their largest-ever World Cup victory with a decisive 73-0 win against Samoa. The match saw the team score a record 11 tries, including a first-half hat-trick from winger Desiree Miller, placing them at the top of their pool. The dominant performance marks a strong start to their tournament campaign, though it was against a significantly lower-ranked Samoan team competing in their first World Cup since 2014. Australia's next match against the United States will be a more crucial test for their quarter-final qualification hopes.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment in the United States, according to The Princeton Review. The ranking considers academics, financial aid, and overall cost to determine which schools offer the best value for students. Georgia Tech's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math contributes to high post-graduation earnings for its students, reinforcing its value proposition. The report highlights that despite its academic rigor, the university fosters a supportive and collaborative environment rather than a cut-throat one. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new medical technology is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. The article highlights the story of a 71-year-old restaurateur who, months after a stroke, saw significant improvement in his left arm and hand function after receiving the implant at the Cleveland Clinic. This first-of-its-kind technology is being hailed as a potential game-changer for improving motor function for a patient population with previously limited options.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down by older generations, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize family conflict and tax burdens. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death, rather than as a lifetime gift, to take advantage of a "step-up in basis" that reduces capital gains taxes for heirs. Using legal structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can also protect the property from lawsuits and creditors. It is also crucial to create a detailed operating agreement for shared properties and set aside liquid assets to cover ongoing expenses like maintenance and insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

The new committees are tasked with improving portfolio management, pursuing M&A opportunities, and boosting operating margins, which have lagged behind peers.

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful and costly hurricanes, Florida residents and developers are prioritizing climate resilience in their rebuilding and relocation efforts. The article highlights Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be "storm-proof" with features like underground power lines, native landscaping for water absorption, and reinforced homes, which sustained minimal damage from Hurricane Ian. In lower-income communities like Miami's Coconut Grove, nonprofits and city programs are helping residents rebuild their homes at higher elevations with hurricane-resistant materials. These efforts reflect a growing recognition that proactive mitigation is essential for a future with more extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society (CBS) Arena, its home stadium, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that provides long-term stability and safeguards the club's future after years of uncertainty regarding its home ground. The purchase allows the club to invest directly in facilities and the fan experience, ending a tumultuous period for supporters since leaving their previous stadium in 2005. The move is seen as a statement of ambition, with hopes that full control over stadium revenues will help the club's push for a return to the Premier League.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents, signaling a growing demand for generational change. These challengers argue that the party's aging establishment has become complacent and failed to respond with sufficient urgency to the threats posed by the Trump administration. They contend the divide is not about ideology but about a willingness to fight and innovate, asserting that the party needs new energy and vision to connect with voters. This trend reflects deep introspection within the Democratic party following recent political setbacks and a desire to move beyond a perceived broken status quo.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has finally received his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by the severe abuse he suffered at the infamous Dozier School for Boys. In the 1960s, Horne was sent to the state-run reform school, which became known for its brutal beatings and neglect, causing him to drop out to support his family. He earned his diploma through a new state compensation program for victims of Dozier and a similar institution. Fulfilling a lifelong goal, Horne hopes his story inspires others to overcome major setbacks and never give up on their ambitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by Empower found that Americans, on average, believe the ideal retirement age is 58, which is significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors warn that retiring this early presents considerable challenges, as it could mean funding a non-working period of 30 to 40 years. Key considerations include saving enough to withstand economic downturns and securing healthcare coverage for the years before Medicare eligibility at age 65. Many people who retire early do so for reasons other than financial stability, such as health or employment issues. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists are increasingly recommending tinted sunscreens because they offer protection against visible light, which standard sunscreens do not. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, the same pigment that gives the products their color. While regular sunscreens focus on blocking UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, tinted formulas provide the added benefit of preventing or mitigating these cosmetic but often distressing pigmentation issues, making them a more comprehensive form of sun protection.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to homes. The spectacle is visible from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and is being live-streamed by the U.S. Geological Survey. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption is a significant cultural event, seen as the work of the volcano goddess Pele and connecting them to ancestral stories and traditions.</p>

          <p>Japan is broadening its defense collaborations, recently hosting a multinational naval exercise in the Philippine Sea involving the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Norway. A key part of the exercise saw British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets conducting landing and takeoff drills from the Japanese carrier JS Kaga. This event, described as a "major show of allied strength," highlights Japan's move to enhance tactical integration with a wider range of partners. Analysts suggest this strategy is driven by a need to build a more robust security network in the Indo-Pacific, with a particular eye on countering potential threats from China.</p>
