          <p>Experts discuss the benefits and risks of chiropractic care, noting that while it can reduce tension, inflammation, and stress, it's important to consult a spine specialist for more serious issues. Chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, but are not medical doctors, unlike spine doctors who have extensive medical training. Potential complications from chiropractic treatment can arise if underlying diagnoses are missed, potentially leading to spinal cord injury. Experts recommend a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care and urge patients to seek transparent chiropractors with clear treatment plans.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino has ruled himself out of the running to replace Ange Postecoglou as manager of Tottenham, stating that a return is "not realistic." Postecoglou was sacked despite leading the club to their first piece of silverware in 17 years with a Europa League victory. Pochettino, who previously managed Tottenham for five years, emphasized his commitment to his current role as the US Men's National Team manager, indicating that he is focused on his responsibilities with the national team.</p>

          <p>The UK government will allocate an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector as part of the upcoming Spending Review, with the goal of funding research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries.

The government said that investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security, with the total investment expected to exceed ¬£22.5 billion per year by 2029.

          <p>Almost six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are showing renewed interest in lunar exploration. The Artemis program, led by NASA and involving international collaborators, aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole. The moon is rich in resources like iron, silicon, and water, which could be used for scientific research and as a base to get to Mars. These bases could serve as "transit lounges" for astronauts on their way to Mars, and the moon could also be used for energy production.</p>

          <p>As the Labour government approaches its first year, the upcoming Spending Review presents an opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision. Chief executives express concern that the government appears hesitant, despite holding a significant majority. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, allocating 2.7% of GDP over five years, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. Long-term certainty over capital sums could incentivize private investment, particularly in green technologies, but the government must prioritize long-term challenges and avoid short-term political considerations.</p>
