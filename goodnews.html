          <p>The winning numbers for the Powerball's estimated $1.8 billion jackpot, the game's second-largest prize in history, were announced as 11, 23, 44, 61, 62 with a Powerball of 17. The top prize had swelled after no winning tickets were sold for the previous $1.4 billion drawing. While it remains unknown if there was a winner for Saturday's drawing, a single jackpot winner would have the option of a lump sum payment of $826.4 million or an annuity, which would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, highlighting the rarity of such a significant win.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air and enable them to swim, by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This novel technique, detailed in the peer-reviewed journal Science, involves using lasers to quickly heat light-absorbing materials, causing water droplets on the surface to boil and trigger the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles grow to a certain point, they suddenly collapse, rapidly releasing energy and creating a strong force. This controlled 'cavitation' mechanism provides an efficient and precise propulsion system for small robots on wet surfaces.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka secured her second consecutive US Open title, triumphing over American Amanda Anisimova with a hard-fought 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory in a battle of powerful ball-strikers. This win marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam trophy, all achieved on hard courts, and is particularly significant as she overcame previous emotional struggles that led to losses in two other major finals this year. The world number one demonstrated impressive mental fortitude, especially after a crucial missed overhead smash and a break point in the second set, ultimately becoming the first woman since Serena Williams (2012-14) to win back-to-back Flushing Meadows titles. Anisimova, despite a stronger performance than her Wimbledon final, was left in tears.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across the U.S. are increasingly implementing Yondr locked magnetic pouches as a solution to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, aiming to reduce distractions and enhance student engagement. Over 2.5 million students in 35 states are now required to place their phones in these pouches, which are unlocked at designated school exits. While some students are skeptical and seek workarounds, educators like Yonkers Middle High School principal Dr. Sandy Hattar report positive shifts, noting more in-person conversations and a more focused learning environment. The initiative, though costly, is seen as a way to foster a culture change and help students experience life beyond constant digital connectivity.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan experienced a heartwarming turn of events after an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him during a game, an incident that quickly went viral. In response, the boy was generously gifted a Miami Marlins swag bag by a team staffer and later received an even more memorable surprise: a personal meeting with Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who hit the home run, and an autographed baseball bat. These gestures from both teams aimed to rectify the initial disappointing experience, ensuring the young fan still had a positive and memorable interaction with the sport.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing her November 26 Budget amidst a tumultuous political landscape, marked by recent government resignations, cabinet reshuffles, and volatile global bond markets. Despite initial concerns about a UK-specific financial crisis, Reeves attributed recent market ructions to broader global trends, a view supported by later data. The article suggests that these fragile market conditions will likely necessitate a tough balancing act, pushing for higher taxes or lower spending to address any fiscal gaps, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's judgment on UK productivity being a critical factor in determining the extent of necessary adjustments.

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has co-founded 'Sisters in Service' to provide crucial recognition and support for female military veterans, especially those now working in healthcare. The initiative addresses the unique challenges women face, including misconceptions about their front-line roles and feelings of isolation after leaving service. Many traditional veteran spaces often fail to acknowledge their experiences, leading women to avoid them. 'Sisters in Service' offers a 'cathartic' community for women to connect, share experiences, and access vital support that they often struggle to find elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) from October 12, designed to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. This system will replace traditional passport stamping with biometric registration, requiring travelers to provide fingerprints and a photo at automated kiosks upon their first use. Aimed at enhancing security and streamlining border controls across 29 European countries, the EES has raised concerns about potential long queues during its initial phased rollout, particularly at busy transit points like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The registration will be valid for three years, with details verified on subsequent trips.</p>
