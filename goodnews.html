        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory is a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to challenge Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, potentially re-energizing the national conservative Law and Justice opposition party. He supports traditional Catholic values, Polish sovereignty within the EU, and continued support for Ukraine, but opposes the country joining NATO and the EU during Russia's ongoing aggression. The largely ceremonial role of Poland's president still carries influence through veto powers. </p>

The candidate's heightened security comes amid concerns about political violence and safety during the election period. In contrast, Lee's main rival has stated that he does not require such extensive protection. The election is taking place in a divided country facing numerous internal and external challenges.</p>

          <p>As atomic bomb survivors age, attention is shifting to the surviving trees in Hiroshima as silent witnesses to the tragic event. These trees offer a unique and approachable way to engage with Hiroshima's painful past. Some believe the trees can carry on the legacy of the survivors as fewer individuals remain to share their experiences. The trees provide a tangible connection to the past, helping to preserve the memory of the atomic bombing for future generations.</p>

The Kunming Institute of Zoology collaborated with 34 Southeast Asian research teams to create the SEA3K data set, the first comprehensive genomic atlas of the region. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations and distinct Denisovan ancestry in MSEA populations. This initiative aims to rectify the historical oversight and promote more inclusive genomic research.</p>

Some US critics have flagged her alleged links with the Chinese Communist Party, while some Chinese social media users questioned her elite background. However, others praised her vision of a "shared humanity" and the speech's emotional impact.</p>
