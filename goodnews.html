          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and will pay $511 million for conspiring to help wealthy Americans hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts, according to the Department of Justice. The bank admitted to falsifying records to conceal U.S. ownership and control of accounts, processing fictitious paperwork, and maintaining accounts for undeclared clients. This settlement comes after Credit Suisse previously pleaded guilty in 2014 to similar charges, paying $2.6 billion. The Senate Finance Committee had investigated Credit Suisse for ongoing tax evasion by ultra-wealthy Americans. The agreement requires Credit Suisse and UBS to cooperate with ongoing investigations and disclose information about U.S.-related accounts.</p>

          <p>India is facing increased pressure from cheaper Chinese imports, particularly in the textiles sector, due to escalating trade tensions between China and the United States. Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods have led Chinese manufacturers to seek alternative markets, resulting in a flood of viscose yarn into India at lower prices. This influx threatens local industries, with many small spinning mills slowing production. Despite assurances from China's ambassador, concerns about dumping persist across various sectors, contributing to India's widening trade deficit with China. The Indian government has established a committee to monitor cheap imports and imposed safeguard duties on certain steel imports.</p>

          <p>Cinco de Mayo celebrations are occurring across the United States, featuring music, tacos, tequila, and displays of Mexican culture. However, the festivities are juxtaposed with political rhetoric, particularly from President Trump, who has labeled Mexican immigrants as criminals. The holiday, commemorating the 1862 Battle of Puebla, is often misunderstood as Mexico's Independence Day. Latino activists emphasize the importance of understanding the holiday's historical significance and avoiding the commercialization and stereotyping of Mexican culture.

The operation has been costly, with $40 million spent in the first month, including $3 million on unused tents. Critics have called the operation a waste of taxpayer funds and military resources. The task force in charge of migrant detention at Guant√°namo Bay was holding 32 migrants awaiting deportation and had about 725 staff members.</p>

The move aims to address concerns that the pursuit of growth was compromising the company's original mission of benefiting humanity. The decision followed scrutiny from former staff and outside experts, who had urged regulators to intervene.

The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy habits. The study analyzed a live zoster vaccine, and further research is needed to determine if non-live vaccines like Shingrix have similar benefits.

Ford cited near-term risks, potential supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of future or increased tariffs as reasons for pulling its guidance.

Ford is less affected by the tariffs than other automakers because most of its vehicles are made in the United States. The company said that the administration's shifting tariff policies had the potential to disrupt automotive supply chains, and they could force other nations to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.</p>

          <p>California's tourism industry reached a new record in 2024 with $157.3 billion in spending and 24,000 new jobs, but Gov. Gavin Newsom anticipates a decline due to President Trump's tariffs. The state expects a 1% decrease in overall visitation and a 9.2% drop in international tourism, attributed to federal economic policies. Local businesses have reported a downturn in travel, and Canadian tourism has also declined. Newsom has initiated a marketing plan to attract Canadian tourists back to California. The governor is also suing the Trump administration, challenging the president's authority to impose international tariffs without congressional approval.</p>
