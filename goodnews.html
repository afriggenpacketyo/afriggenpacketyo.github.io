          <p>Caught between the US-China trade war, Asean is strategically positioning itself by finalizing an upgraded free-trade agreement with China while seeking discussions with the U.S. regarding tariffs. The upgraded agreement with China aims to deepen economic integration through digital trade, green economy initiatives, and supply chain connectivity, with bilateral trade exceeding $980 billion last year. Meanwhile, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is advocating for a unified Asean response to ensure trade fairness amid rising tensions. Asean has the opportunity to assert itself as a key player in global trade by fostering a neutral, inclusive ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players, including Alex de Minaur and Iga Swiatek, are voicing concerns about the increasingly unsustainable physical demands of the tennis calendar. De Minaur attributed his early French Open exit to burnout, while Swiatek described the current demands as "pretty exhausting." Players fear that careers will be shortened due to mental and physical strain caused by excessive tennis. The ATP and WTA Tours acknowledge these concerns, but finding a solution to alleviate the strain remains a challenge.</p>

          <p>A new European study indicates that parents experience a greater sense of meaning in life compared to childfree individuals, but they also report lower life satisfaction, especially mothers. The study highlights that factors such as being a single parent, young, or having low educational qualifications contribute to decreased satisfaction. Scandinavian countries show smaller disparities between parents and childfree individuals, attributed to robust family policies and societal support. Greater gender equality and supportive business cultures also contribute to higher satisfaction among parents in these regions.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, a palliative care physician reflects on how mortality forces clarity about how we truly wish to live. Rather than focusing on outlandish bucket lists, people often reconcile differences between the life they have and the one they longed for. Reflection on mortality nudges people toward a more complicated version of the ordinary, such as attending a small wedding ceremony or calling an estranged sibling. The author suggests that living with an awareness of uncertainty allows for the possibility of living freely.</p>
