          <h2>WTO Fisheries Agreement Offers Hope for Multilateral Cooperation</h2>

          <p>Despite widespread concerns about the decline of global cooperation, a recent World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement offers a sign of life for multilateralism. After 25 years of negotiations, WTO members have ratified a deal to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies, a significant achievement for the organization. This development, coupled with China's recent announcement that it will no longer exploit special provisions for developing countries, provides a much-needed boost to the international body. The article suggests that even amid rising protectionism and nationalist rhetoric, collaborative international agreements are still possible and can address critical global issues like environmental sustainability.</p>

The 38-year-old midfielder has had a decorated career, winning 32 major trophies with Barcelona, including nine La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. He was also a key member of the Spanish national team that won the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championship. Busquets joined Inter Miami in 2023, where he reunited with former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi, Jordi Alba, and Luis Suarez, and will finish his career after the MLS playoffs.</p>

          <p>European Union members are set to hold their first official talks on a proposal to create a continent-wide anti-drone defense system, referred to as a 'drone wall'. The discussions, prompted by recent Russian drone incursions into EU airspace, will involve officials from about 10 countries, primarily along the eastern border, as well as Denmark and Ukraine. The initiative follows a call from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for enhanced air defense capabilities. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drone attacks continue to target Russian infrastructure, with experts estimating that repeated strikes have significantly reduced Russia's oil processing capacity.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, analysis points to several key factors that will determine whether Team Europe can overcome the home-field advantage held by the U.S. at Bethpage Black. Historically, the home side has dominated recent competitions, making a fast start in the opening foursomes session crucial for the visiting Europeans to quiet the notoriously boisterous New York crowd. Europe boasts greater collective Ryder Cup experience, with veterans like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, which could prove decisive. However, the U.S. team, led by world number one Scottie Scheffler, will be motivated to reclaim the trophy after a convincing defeat in Rome.</p>

          <p>During a farewell meeting for Beijing's outgoing ambassador, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that maritime differences should not define the entire relationship between the two countries. He emphasized the need to continue deepening trade, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people interactions. The Chinese embassy echoed this sentiment, expressing hope that relations could be put back on a stable track. This diplomatic language marks a potential de-escalation in tone, harkening back to a 2023 joint statement that maritime issues do not represent the sum of their bilateral ties, even as underlying territorial disputes in the South China Sea remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Energy giant BP, which was widely seen as a prime takeover target just months ago, has seen a significant turnaround in market sentiment. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since early April, outperforming many rivals, due to a strategic reset, a new leadership team, and recent oil discoveries. This improved performance has quieted the intense speculation that rivals like Shell or Exxon Mobil might acquire the British firm. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is now focused on growth, with strong second-quarter profits and promising discoveries boosting investor confidence and leading to positive analyst upgrades.</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart has stated that it is pleased to see a decline in the secondary market prices for its wildly popular Labubu monster toys. After experiencing a massive surge in popularity where resale prices reached over 2,000% of retail value, the market is now cooling as the company has significantly increased production to meet demand. Pop Mart clarified that its products are intended for genuine fans, not for speculative profit, and that an inflated resale market ultimately alienates its core customers. Analysts see this as a strategic pivot towards a more sustainable, long-term business model rather than relying on short-term hype.</p>

          <p>China has opened an international operations center for its digital yuan (e-CNY) in Shanghai, signaling a major push to promote the currency's use in cross-border payments. The People's Bank of China announced three new platforms designed to improve the efficiency of international transactions, enable blockchain-based payments, and support digital asset services. This initiative is part of China's broader strategy to offer an alternative to the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system. A central bank official stated that the evolution towards digital currency is a "historical inevitability" and that China is committed to providing innovative solutions for global payments.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated his readiness to leave office once the war with Russia concludes. In an interview, he stated that his primary goal is to end the conflict, not to secure another term as president. When asked directly, Zelenskyy confirmed that he would move forward with holding elections in Ukraine if a ceasefire were established. His five-year term officially would have ended in May 2024, but elections are currently suspended under the martial law imposed since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, a situation that has extended his time in office.</p>
