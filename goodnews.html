          <p>With auto insurance costs having surged by 51% over the last three years, drivers are seeking ways to reduce their premiums without sacrificing protection. This article outlines several effective strategies, including inquiring about all available discounts, bundling auto policies with home or renters insurance, and reviewing whether expensive collision or comprehensive coverage is necessary for older, less valuable cars. Other tips include raising deductibles for a lower premium and ensuring your listed annual mileage is accurate if you are driving less.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the United States has successfully negotiated a trade deal with Vietnam, with specific details to be released soon. The agreement comes less than a week before a 90-day pause on many of the administration's reciprocal tariffs is set to expire. It was not immediately clear how the new deal would affect the 46% blanket tariff that had been applied to Vietnamese imports under the existing protectionist trade policy.</p>

          <p>A Virgin Australia domestic flight from Melbourne was delayed for two hours after a two-foot green tree snake was discovered in the aircraft's cargo hold. A professional snake catcher was called to the scene and successfully removed the non-venomous reptile, which likely boarded the plane in a passenger's luggage during a previous flight. The snake, a protected species, could not be returned to the wild for quarantine reasons and will be rehomed with a licensed keeper.</p>

The team has managed this success despite injuries to key pitchers and offensive slumps from stars like Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. Manager Dave Roberts believes the team's best performance is still ahead, a concerning prospect for competitors as the Dodgers have significant room for improvement before the postseason.</p>

          <p>This article explains the racketeering (RICO) charge that was a central part of the federal case against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, on which he was ultimately acquitted. The RICO law, originally designed to prosecute mob bosses, requires prosecutors to prove a defendant ran a coordinated criminal enterprise. In this case, the government argued Combs used his staff to facilitate crimes like sex trafficking, but defense lawyers contended the staff were not knowingly complicit, making the complex charge difficult for the jury to uphold.</p>
