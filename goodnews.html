          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, dubbed 'a flying palace,' as a gift from the Qatari royal family. The aircraft would serve as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, after which ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses by the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice have deemed the arrangement legally permissible, stating it does not violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause, as the gift is not conditioned on any official act. The plane will initially be modified by the U.S. Air Force to meet military specifications before being transferred to the foundation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has begun enforcing stricter border controls, turning away asylum seekers at its borders with neighboring European countries. Citing pressure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Merz vowed to implement permanent controls at all nine of Germany's land borders to curb illegal migrant entries. The move has faced criticism from politicians and neighboring EU countries, with concerns raised about compliance with European law and potential border congestion. The government maintains that the measure is necessary due to Germany's 'special situation' regarding migrant intake.</p>

          <p>Chinese mathematicians from Fudan University and UCLA have purportedly resolved the Kervaire invariant problem, a decades-old puzzle in the field of topology. The solution, achieved through major computational methods, provides proof for the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126. This breakthrough is said to resolve a loose end of a 'doomsday hypothesis,' and the methods used could be applied to other problems in the field.

The author contends that caring for another can be an epic journey filled with life-altering trials and triumphs, offering profound insights about ourselves, other people, and life itself. By recognizing the value of caregiving, society can move beyond simplistic binaries applied to motherhood and create a more inclusive understanding of wisdom and heroism that prioritizes human connection over rugged individualism.</p>

The massive dividend reduction eases pressure on Aramco itself, but means less revenue for the Saudi government.

          <p>A guest essay by Dr. Mathilde Ross challenges the notion of the 'perfect mother,' arguing that flaws are an essential part of a mother's role in teaching children about acceptance and healthy relationships. She criticizes the tendency of psychiatrists to blame mothers for their children's problems and emphasizes the importance of cutting mothers some slack. The article encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and recognize that being 'good enough' is sufficient for raising well-adjusted children.</p>
