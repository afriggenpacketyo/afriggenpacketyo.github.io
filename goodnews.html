          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is navigating a complex economic landscape with volatile policies and pressure from President Trump for rate cuts. Despite solid economic indicators, surveys show heightened concerns in manufacturing, services, and consumer sentiment, with tariff worries impacting corporate earnings. Powell is hesitant to make pre-emptive cuts, balancing the Fed's mandate of full employment and low inflation, but risks being labeled "Too Late" if he waits for clearer data.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and family formation are critical issues that progressives should address, despite right-wing interest in pronatalism. An aging and shrinking population can lead to decreased quality of life, a smaller workforce supporting a larger elderly population, and potential economic and environmental challenges. The author suggests policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and affordable healthcare could support families and align with progressive priorities, urging a serious conversation about population without ceding the issue to partisan politics.</p>
