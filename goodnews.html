        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the popular Labubu monster toys, expresses satisfaction with the significant drop in secondary market resale prices, which had previously seen markups over 2,000%. This decline, the company states, aligns with its core mission to make art accessible to genuine enthusiasts rather than fueling a speculative, profit-driven market that alienates real customers. Pop Mart has dramatically increased production to meet demand and is actively expanding its global presence, particularly in North America and Asia-Pacific. Analysts suggest this move aims to establish a more sustainable business model and prevent the brand from becoming a fleeting trend, with the company also investing in original animation to deepen character engagement.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, clarified that pregnant women should take Tylenol if advised by a doctor, despite recent White House statements regarding an alleged link to autism. While FDA Commissioner Marty Makary's letter mentioned an association between acetaminophen and autism, it emphasized no causal relationship has been established, and acetaminophen remains the safest option for fevers during pregnancy. Medical experts warn against avoiding Tylenol, fearing patients might turn to less safe alternatives, with the drug's maker, Kenvue, also asserting its safety. Oz stressed transparency but advised consultation with physicians before use.</p>

          <p>Health officials are warning of a seasonal surge in flu and Covid-19 cases this autumn, urging the public to be vigilant about symptoms. While both viruses share many common indicators, flu often presents with sudden fever, aches, and exhaustion, distinct from typical cold symptoms. Covid-19, with its evolving variants like Stratus, can manifest as cold symptoms but also includes persistent cough, fatigue, and loss of taste or smell, with a hoarse throat now a hallmark. Vaccinations are emphasized as the strongest defense against severe illness, with eligible individuals encouraged to get their flu and Covid-19 booster shots to reduce strain on healthcare systems and protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>China has inaugurated its digital yuan international operations center in Shanghai, signaling intensified efforts to promote the digital currency in cross-border payments and overseas markets. The People's Bank of China highlighted three platforms designed to accelerate the e-CNY's internationalization, including a cross-border digital payment platform and a blockchain service platform to expand financial infrastructure onto the blockchain. This strategic move offers an alternative amid the international frenzy over stablecoins and aims to reshape the global financial architecture currently dominated by the US dollar. The central bank is committed to providing open, inclusive, and innovative solutions to improve the global cross-border payment system.</p>

Quarterback Sam Darnold threw for 242 yards and a touchdown, and Kenneth Walker III rushed for 81 yards, but the Seahawks initially blew a 14-point fourth-quarter lead. Kyler Murray led a spirited late Cardinals rally, scoring two touchdowns in the final minutes to tie the game. However, a crucial penalty on the ensuing kickoff gave Seattle excellent field position, allowing Myers to clinch the game with his decisive kick, making up for an earlier miss.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated his readiness to leave office once the war with Russia concludes, emphasizing that his primary goal is achieving peace rather than securing another term. In an interview, he affirmed he would push for elections in Ukraine if a ceasefire were established, despite martial law currently prohibiting them. Zelenskyy, whose five-year term would have ended in May 2024 without the ongoing conflict, clarified that leading in peacetime is not his personal ambition, reiterating his commitment to his country during this difficult period. This article highlights his focus on national resolution over personal political longevity.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly acknowledged that Labour, and other left-wing parties, previously "shied away from people's concerns around illegal immigration," admitting it has been too easy for individuals to enter and work illegally. He plans to announce a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as part of Labour's strategy to tackle the issue, framing it as a necessary step for "patriotic national renewal." This shift aims to counter the rising popularity of Reform UK and address public anxieties, despite criticism from opposition parties who label the plan a "desperate gimmick" and raise civil liberties concerns.</p>

Ganguly observes that sole founders can now thrive with AI's assistance, and highlights India as a market building innovative AI-native applications. While acknowledging a "frothy" market, he believes the long-term impact will reshape industries less touched by technology, despite overvaluation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors who alleged nearly half a million books were illegally pirated to train its chatbots. The settlement, which will compensate authors and publishers about $3,000 per book, addresses claims that Anthropic wrongfully acquired works from pirate websites, despite a prior ruling that AI training itself constitutes transformative fair use. This landmark agreement is seen as a significant step by authors and publishers to hold AI developers accountable for infringement and to push for legal licensing practices, though the distribution process is expected to be complex.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576 aims to regulate commercial volume on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing ads from being significantly louder than programs. This initiative, inspired by an 8-month-old baby being woken by a blaring commercial, seeks to close a loophole in the federal CALM Act, which currently only applies to traditional broadcasters. If signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill could set a national precedent, as companies often avoid creating separate policies for California. Despite opposition from the Motion Picture Association, this article reports that the bill has passed the state Senate and is popular with consumers.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. Trading in coral is highly restricted under international conservation agreements due to many species being endangered or threatened, with these corals likely destined for pet shops. The aquarium, acting as a "coral hospital," took in the specimens which were in poor health after five days in transit, successfully rehabilitating many. These now-recovered corals are on public display, serving as ambassadors for their species and educating visitors about the illegal wildlife trade and crucial conservation efforts.</p>
