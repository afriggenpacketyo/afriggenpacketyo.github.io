          <p>Top European business leaders are encouraging the continent to capitalize on recent market volatility, hoping that the United States' economic dominance is diminishing. They point to Europe's Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500 since late 2024, coupled with capital inflows into European stocks and outflows from U.S. equities. Factors contributing to this shift include converging growth rates and cheaper valuations in Europe. However, trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. remain a potential challenge, though leaders are optimistic about finding a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a potential takeover of the energy major. ADNOC's interest comes amid BP's underperformance and a strategic reset aimed at restoring investor confidence. Other companies, including Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron, have also been mentioned as possible suitors for BP. BP is seeking to increase oil and gas spending while reducing investments in renewables as part of its strategic shift.</p>
