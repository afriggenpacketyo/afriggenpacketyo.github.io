          <p>Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III commented on a viral video in which a female fan, dubbed "Phillies Karen," berated a father for giving a home run ball to his son. Griffin stated that since she dropped the ball, she had no claim to it and should have had better hands. The incident, which ended with the father and son meeting the player who hit the home run, sparked widespread discussion. Griffin also shared a personal anecdote about a fan who feigned being in a wheelchair to get an autograph from him during his Heisman Trophy ceremony.</p>

          <p>France's national women's rugby team staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Ireland 18-13 in the World Cup quarter-finals in Exeter. After trailing 13-0 at halftime, the French team scored 18 unanswered points in the second half to secure their spot in the semi-finals. A pivotal moment was France's incredible defensive stand at the end of the first half, preventing Ireland from extending their lead. The victory continues France's long-standing dominance over Ireland, whom they have not lost to since 2017.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offers a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte's peers focused on landscapes and ballerinas, his work often centered on male figures in domestic settings, which sometimes scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition, which features his famous painting "Paris Street; Rainy Day," explores the unique themes and sensuous nature of his art. Curators note that the show encourages various interpretations of his focus on men and his place within the Impressionist movement.</p>

          <p>Actor and comedian Marlon Wayans is starring in a new psychological horror film titled "Him," marking a significant departure from his comedic roots. In the movie, he plays an aging football star who makes a sinister bargain with a rookie quarterback. Wayans explains that he drew upon the personal pain of losing close family members, including his mother, to inform his dramatic performance. He also reflects on his career, from his time at LaGuardia High School to his work within the Wayans family comedy dynasty, and how he has learned to channel grief into his acting.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the recent Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support struggling local businesses and foster community healing. Founded by a resident who lost her home, the group organizes weekly gatherings at different family-owned restaurants, providing them with a vital economic boost. For the members, many of whom were displaced by the fire, the club offers a space to connect with neighbors who share the profound experience of loss. This initiative serves as both a practical recovery effort and a source of emotional support for a community rebuilding from tragedy.</p>

          <p>Large wooden timbers from a historic shipwreck, estimated to date back to the 1800s or earlier, have been discovered on Matanzas Beach in St. Johns County, Florida. County Beach Services staff found the fragments and collaborated with the St. Augustine Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP) to preserve them. To protect the artifacts from sun damage and potential theft, one of the timbers was carefully reburied under wet sand. Researchers have documented the find using GPS and photogrammetry to create a 3D model, which will aid in studying Florida's maritime history.</p>

          <p>Historian Jill Lepore and National Constitution Center CEO Jeffrey Rosen explore the history and enduring relevance of the U.S. Constitution. They emphasize that the founding fathers designed the document to be a work in progress, with Article V providing a mechanism for amendments to reflect an evolving nation. The article highlights that foundational elements like the Bill of Rights were themselves the result of proposed changes. Rosen expresses concern that modern political gridlock and an over-reliance on the Supreme Court for interpretation have strayed from the founders' vision of a government shaped by deliberation and legislative action.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out "Hear the Highlights," an AI feature that provides short, voiced audio summaries of products, drawing information from product catalogs, web data, and customer reviews. This development prompts a discussion on whether AI can effectively replace the nuanced and often idiosyncratic insights found in traditional user reviews. While AI can process vast amounts of data without cognitive overload, experts question its ability to capture critical context, such as safety concerns, that human shoppers often prioritize. The feature could enhance accessibility but also risks oversimplifying information and blending marketing language with genuine user feedback.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that Europe's Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for their upcoming tournament at Bethpage in New York: virtual reality headsets. Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players acclimate to the hostile crowd environment expected on American soil. The VR simulations can be programmed to shout abuse and replicate the sights and sounds of a partisan audience, with McIlroy noting he asked for the experience to be as intense as possible. This innovative approach is part of the team's detailed preparation as they aim to win the Ryder Cup in the U.S. for the first time since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are weighing in on key storylines and potential outcomes. Topics of discussion include whether the postseason is better off without the intense media focus on the Angel Reese-Caitlin Clark rivalry, as both of their teams missed the playoffs. Experts are also identifying high-seeded teams at risk of an early exit and long-shot contenders like the expansion Golden State Valkyries. Many eyes are on the Minnesota Lynx, who are seen as being on a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, with star Napheesa Collier considered a top MVP candidate.</p>

Oracle's stock has surged due to massive growth in its cloud infrastructure business, with contracted revenue projections indicating significant future expansion.

          <p>Political observers are analyzing the successful mayoral primary campaign of progressive Zohran Mamdani in New York for potential lessons for the UK's struggling Labour Party. Mamdani's success is attributed to his sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, clear policy solutions, and a compelling narrative that picks a side against the establishment. His campaign's savvy use of social media to connect with voters also stands in contrast to the UK government's slower adaptation to new media. While not a direct template, his approach highlights the importance of authenticity and a clear vision in an era of voter disillusionment.</p>
