          <p>Spirit Airlines announced it is making "massive progress" in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, according to its restructuring lawyer. The budget carrier has secured agreements for up to $475 million in new financing and an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor to aid its revitalization efforts. This development follows Spirit's second bankruptcy filing in under a year, prompted by over $250 million in losses due to high costs and weaker demand. The airline is actively cutting costs, including reducing routes and furloughing flight attendants, while also negotiating concessions with its pilots' union. (not investment advice)</p>

The investment bank was selected as a financial advisor in the historic $55 billion leveraged buyout of video game publisher Electronic Arts. This trend is further supported by investment bank Jefferies reporting its best-ever third-quarter revenue, driven by a surge in advisory fees. These events reinforce a bullish outlook on Goldman's investment banking division, which has been recovering after a slowdown caused by higher interest rates and economic uncertainty.

          <p>California-based startup Aetherflux is developing satellite technology to create mini solar farms in low-Earth orbit, which will collect solar power and beam it to Earth using infrared lasers. Co-founded by Robinhood's Baiju Bhatt and backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the company plans its first launch on a SpaceX rocket next year. The system will transmit energy to a network of small ground stations, with the U.S. Department of Defense as an initial key customer. While the technology is currently expensive, the company anticipates costs will decrease as the satellite constellation expands and technology matures.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has launched new Protein Lattes and Protein Cold Foam, aiming to cater to the growing trend of increased protein consumption. The beverages contain between 15 and 36 grams of whey protein, which some dietitians say could benefit individuals who often skip breakfast or need higher protein intake, like athletes. However, experts caution against using these drinks as meal replacements, as they lack essential nutrients like fiber and antioxidants found in whole foods. They also highlight the high sugar content in some drinks and advise that most people can meet their protein needs through a balanced diet.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is planning to begin processing new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for the first time since 2021. According to a Justice Department proposal filed in a Texas court, initial applications would be accepted in every state except Texas. Under the plan, current DACA recipients in Texas could maintain their deportation protection but would lose their work authorization. The move comes amid ongoing legal battles over the Obama-era program, which provides protection and work permits to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily lower the prices of its medications in the United States. Under the deal, Pfizer will sell existing drugs to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and will offer new drugs at this "most-favored-nation" price to all payers. In exchange, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, as long as it invests $70 billion in U.S.-based manufacturing and research. The White House confirmed it is in similar negotiations with other drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly, to secure comparable agreements.</p>

The project involves painstaking work such as reupholstering and reinstalling balcony chairs that date back to the 1890s. For volunteers like Felipe Colon, who was recently released after 21 years in prison, the restoration work provides a new sense of purpose and an opportunity for personal reform. The church, known as America's first integrated church, is undergoing a major makeover that its pastor hopes will make the sanctuary feel welcoming once again when it reopens in October.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance on how to identify trustworthy debt settlement programs while avoiding potential scams. Reputable companies should have professional accreditation from organizations like the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators and a good standing with the Better Business Bureau. A key indicator of a legitimate service is a transparent fee structure that does not charge upfront fees before a debt has been successfully settled, as this is prohibited by federal law. Consumers should also look for honest communication about the risks, including potential credit score damage and a realistic process timeline of two to four years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. Currently, the monthly payment on an $80,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment period is approximately $966, down from over $1,010 a year ago. HELOCs offer variable interest rates, meaning borrowers could see further reductions in their payments if the Fed continues to cut rates. While HELOCs are currently cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans and personal loans, homeowners must carefully consider the variable nature of the payments to ensure long-term affordability.

          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily refers to the maximum time most negative information, such as late payments or charge-offs, can legally remain on a credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This seven-year clock typically begins from the date of the first missed payment. Additionally, states have statutes of limitations, often around seven years, after which a creditor can no longer sue to collect the debt. However, the debt itself does not disappear and collectors may still attempt to contact you, making it crucial for consumers to understand their rights and the nuances of these timelines.
