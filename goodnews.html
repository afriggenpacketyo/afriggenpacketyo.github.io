          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a wet-dry Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a timely safety car intervention. Oscar Piastri, Norris's McLaren teammate, initially led the race after overtaking Kimi Antonelli at the start, but the safety car, triggered by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, shuffled the order. Norris pitted for slick tires just before the safety car was deployed, allowing him to rejoin the race in the lead. Max Verstappen, who finished fourth, was later penalized for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to 17th.</p>

The BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service, designated the AfD as a threat due to its xenophobic stances and incompatibility with the country's democratic order.
