          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. The decision came after Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, addressing its primary concerns. The country had previously held up the package, which requires unanimous approval from all 27 member states, over a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. EU ambassadors are now expected to formally approve the new sanctions.</p>

          <p>The White House announced President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common circulatory condition, after he experienced mild leg swelling. CVI occurs when damaged valves in leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool, which can lead to swelling, varicose veins, and discomfort. According to his physician, the condition is benign and common in adults over 70. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods like compression stockings and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which aid in blood circulation.</p>

          <p>The city of Long Beach is considering a proposal to bring a new professional baseball team to play at the historic Blair Field. The City Council will evaluate a plan to work with an ownership group, which includes a co-founder of the successful independent Oakland Ballers. If approved, the new team would join the Pioneer League as an expansion team starting next season. Proponents believe the city's strong baseball tradition and current growth make it an ideal time for a new team, despite previous independent league teams in Long Beach having struggled.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that her recent song "Heterocomía" was a costly artistic endeavor that she does not expect to be profitable. The track features a sample from the Disney film "The Aristocats," for which she brokered an expensive deal, stating the catharsis was worth the price. The song's lyrics, which transition from a whimsical introduction to a tale of deception, have led fans to speculate it is about her past relationship with a billionaire heir known for having heterochromia. While Belinda has not confirmed the rumors, she seems to value the artistic expression and "sweet revenge" over royalties.</p>
