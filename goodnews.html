          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng has reported strong sales for June, demonstrating resilience amid an intense price war in the country's EV market. The company delivered over 34,000 cars, marking its eighth consecutive month of exceeding 30,000 deliveries, while rivals like Nio and Li Auto showed more mixed results. The fierce competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being unproductive, continues to pressure automakers, including Tesla. Xpeng's steady performance highlights its ability to navigate the challenging landscape dominated by market leader BYD. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. this year. The decision prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits, a move that was planned for September. The judge stated that the administration does not have the authority to prematurely end the designation, which the previous administration had extended until February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, creating ongoing uncertainty for the affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded instances. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive immigration policies, including swift deportations and the cessation of migrant releases into the U.S. This figure represents a significant shift from the high numbers seen under the previous administration. The administration's strategy includes enhanced border barriers, large-scale interior arrests, and a messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation, though these tactics have drawn considerable criticism.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the United States' most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, named "Amara's Law," was inspired by Amara Strande, a young woman who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to the chemicals in her community's water. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The effort marks a significant victory for public health advocates in a state where 3M, the original developer of PFAS, is headquartered.</p>
