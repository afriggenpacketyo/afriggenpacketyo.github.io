          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are delaying hiring or not replacing departing employees, leading to a decrease in job vacancies. Between March and May, available jobs decreased by 63,000, while the unemployment rate saw a slight increase, signaling a weakening labor market. Some firms may be holding back on recruitment due to increased employer National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage, and this could lead to a further rise in the unemployment rate in the coming year. Average wage growth slowed to 5.2% between February and April, but it remains above the rate of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases through its website in April due to a cyber attack. Shoppers can now buy a selection of fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with more products and services to follow in the coming weeks. The cyber attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click and collect and contactless payments, and M&S estimates that it will reduce this year's profits by around ¬£300 million.

          <p>Some investors in Toyota Industries voiced disapproval of a $33 billion buyout offer from Toyota Motor, echoing concerns that the bid undervalues the company and strengthens the Toyoda family's control. Shareholders expressed their worries at the company's annual general meeting, questioning the fairness of the 16,300 yen a share offer price. Toyota has stated that the acquisition would allow Toyota Industries to deepen collaboration with group companies without short-term profit concerns. Oasis Management, which holds shares in both Toyota Motor and Toyota Industries, has indicated it will push for a higher price.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices of the staple food. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move will leave the country with a rice reserve of around 100,000 tons, and Koizumi has expressed interest in increasing rice imports to ensure a stable domestic supply. The government suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of price hikes.</p>

The EU is preparing a new two-euro flat fee on previously customs-free small packages from online marketplaces. Consumer spending on Temu in the U.S. fell about 36% in May, while Shein's fell 13%, but both platforms have seen increased ad spending and consumer spending growth in Europe. Experts say the EU's potential duties on small-value packages may signal more pressures to come for Temu and Shein.</p>

The government will step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various fields.

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia rose significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that pressured by import tariffs imposed by the U.S., Chinese manufacturers are shipping more to factory sites in nearby Southeast Asia to produce goods for sale locally or in Western countries, including the U.S., with factories often injecting enough local content to declare re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.
