          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release, citing violations of her due process and First Amendment rights. Ozturk was detained after co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas, which the Trump administration cited as the reason for revoking her student visa. She expressed gratitude for the support she received and emphasized the importance of justice and democracy, while leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests extending Father's Day into a month-long celebration, following Mother's Day. His proposal involves alternating days of gift-giving and complete silence, creating a 'Ramadad' experience for fathers. While acknowledging the impracticality of his idea, Gaffigan playfully advocates for greater recognition of fathers, emphasizing the importance of honoring them in a lighthearted and self-deprecating manner. He hopes to implement Father's Day Month next year.</p>

          <p>Despite the belief of some business leaders, artificial intelligence is not yet capable of replacing human workers in most workplaces. A recent survey revealed that over half of the businesses that laid off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their jobs now regret that decision. Generative AI platforms are currently more of an enhanced search tool rather than a replacement for employees, and the technology is too expensive and unreliable for most small and mid-sized companies to implement in core operations.</p>
