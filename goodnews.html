          <h2>Tariffs Have Not Yet Increased Inflation Due to Several Factors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 12:02:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs would raise inflation, traditional inflation measurements have not yet reflected this. Recent consumer and producer price readings were stable, with prices rising only slightly in May. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the time it takes for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. While the full impact of tariffs is expected to materialize in the coming months, these factors have kept inflation in check for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree analyzes tipping habits across the United States, finding that consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars, and other eateries in 2023. The study indicates that tipping rates are higher in states where people eat out more frequently, with New Hampshire residents being the most generous tippers. It also explores which states spend the most on dining out, highlighting the increasing trend of Americans swapping home cooking for restaurant meals. The study sheds light on the role of tipping in the service industry, where many workers rely on gratuities to supplement their income. (not investment advice)</p>

Stewart publicly addressed the situation, stating that he is not asking for anything the Bengals haven't done before. The dispute reportedly centers around the Bengals' attempt to change the way first-round rookie contracts are structured, which would allow the team to void future guarantees. Despite the contract issues, Stewart has been attending team meetings and studying his playbook.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 11:32:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to walk back his proposed "reciprocal" tariffs on goods imported from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico. The executives anticipate that the 10% duties currently in place will remain after the 90-day pause lapses in July, rather than the higher rates initially imposed. This optimism stems from recent trade negotiations with China and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs. However, some caution that this optimism may be premature, as other countries lack China's leverage in negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, China will send Premier Li Qiang to represent the country at the event in New York. While the bilateral relationship seems to have improved following a recent phone call between Xi and Trump, a visit to the UN would require months of preparation, making it unlikely for September.
