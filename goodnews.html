Curtis discusses his early life in West Texas, the formation of rock 'n' roll, and his friendship with Holly. Despite feeling left behind when Holly's band, The Crickets, found fame, he later joined the group and penned iconic songs like "I Fought the Law." His most enduring legacy may be the theme song for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Love Is All Around," which he wrote and sang.</p>

          <p>After a hiatus of almost ten years, McDonald's is bringing back its popular Monopoly Game promotion, blending physical game pieces with a new digital component. From October 6 to November 2, customers can collect game pieces from select purchases to win instant prizes, including free food, or collect property sets for larger rewards like a $1 million cash prize or a 2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The return of the game follows a major fraud scheme that was uncovered in the early 2000s, which previously led to the promotion's suspension.</p>

Owner Julio Bermejo, a global ambassador for Mexico's tequila industry, has cultivated one of the world's largest vintage tequila selections. The restaurant is credited with popularizing the Tommy's Margarita, a cocktail recipe that uses agave nectar instead of traditional sweeteners and is now featured on menus globally. This milestone comes as tequila sales are surging, nearly surpassing vodka as the top-selling spirit in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing concerns about the safety of its AI chatbot for young users, OpenAI has launched new parental controls for teen ChatGPT accounts. The features allow parents to link their accounts with their teen's, enabling them to set usage time limits, disable voice mode, and prevent chat history from being used for model training. The system will also notify parents if it detects potential signs of self-harm. This move follows a lawsuit from a family alleging the chatbot encouraged their son's suicide, and comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny over AI's impact on minors.</p>

          <p>For 45 years, Denver's Grupo Tlaloc has been dedicated to preserving and sharing the traditions of Mexican Aztec dance. Led by Captain and Elder Carlos Castañeda, the group performs sacred dances that serve as a form of prayer and cultural heritage. The group is now focused on training a younger generation to continue these customs, which were protected as a form of religious expression in the U.S. only after the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. Younger members report feeling a greater sense of peace, connection, and self-confidence through their participation.</p>

          <p>A year after devastating floods from Hurricane Helene ravaged eastern Tennessee, whitewater rafting guides have transitioned to cleanup roles along the still-closed Nolichucky River. With their regular businesses on hold, local outfitters are using state-funded relief grants to employ the guides, who now collect debris ranging from car parts to sheet metal from washed-out homes. This community-led effort aims to restore the watershed, which suffered immense geological changes during the storm. Officials are hopeful that the river, informally dubbed the "New-lichucky," will be ready to reopen for the 2026 season.</p>

This result marks a new low for the West Indies team, which has faced a series of disappointing performances, including a failure to qualify for the 2023 50-over World Cup.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective way to manage stress is not through inward-focused self-care but by channeling stress energy outward to help others. This approach, termed "stress springboarding," leverages the hormone oxytocin, which is released during stress and motivates social connection. Research indicates that workplace wellness programs encouraging volunteer work are uniquely successful. By focusing on contributing to one's community, family, or colleagues, individuals can activate reward centers in the brain and reduce activity in stress-related regions, effectively rewiring their response to pressure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are betting on pitcher Blake Snell to be their postseason ace, five years after he was famously pulled early from a decisive World Series game against them. After an injury-limited debut season in Los Angeles, Snell is slated to start Game 1 of the wild-card series. Snell views his 2020 World Series experience not with regret but as a lesson in proving his durability to managers. He has since focused on developing his ability to pitch deeper into games, a skill the Dodgers hope will anchor their staff through October.</p>

While he plans to take time before making a decision, players and fans have been chanting for "two more years." If he accepts, he would lead the team again in 2027 at Adare Manor in Ireland, a move that would break from the recent tradition of single-term captaincies.</p>

These tools allow researchers to identify species from environmental DNA (eDNA) collected on swabs, analyze vast numbers of photos to find new insects, and map ecosystems in real time. This technological revolution is crucial for cataloging Earth's millions of undescribed species, many of which are part of the "dark taxa" and face extinction due to climate change before they can even be formally identified.</p>
