        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing a wider ban on destructive bottom trawling in its offshore areas, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where pressure is mounting for countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats, with the hope of benefiting both nature and climate. This ban is a win-win for both nature and the climate, which is why it is being enacted.</p>
