          <p>A U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea after an arrestment failure during landing, marking the second such incident in just over a week. Both pilots safely ejected and sustained minor injuries, with no flight deck personnel harmed. This incident follows a previous one where a Super Hornet fell overboard during towing in the hangar bay. The USS Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since deploying to the Middle East in September 2024, including mistakenly shooting down one of their own planes and colliding with a merchant vessel.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf, a move likely to anger Iran, which has historical ties to the former name. Arab nations have long advocated for the change. The decision follows Trump's earlier announcement to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. The Associated Press successfully sued the Trump administration after its journalists were barred from events for refusing to adopt the 'Gulf of America' name.</p>

          <p>Nashville Mayor Freddie O‚ÄôConnell voiced concerns over recent ICE arrests, including a convicted child sex predator and an alleged gang member, stating that these actions do not make the city safer. He emphasized that the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department does not participate in federal immigration enforcement. DHS responded that the mayor should want criminal illegal aliens off the streets, noting a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers. ICE announced over 66,000 arrests and 65,000 removals of illegal immigrants during President Trump's first 100 days of his second term.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans for the first time in five years, initiating wage garnishments and tax refund offsets. The collections were paused during President Trump‚Äôs first term and extended by the Biden administration. More than 5 million borrowers are in default, with an additional 4 million at risk, so the Department of Education is notifying borrowers about the Treasury Offset Program and offering assistance through the Default Resolution Group. Borrowers can check their loan status online and have options to rehabilitate or consolidate their loans to get out of default.</p>

Users are subject to a 10-minute time limit, after which the doors will open automatically to discourage loitering and ensure safety. The city will analyze usage data and cost to determine whether to continue the program.</p>

          <p>China, a top aluminum producer and consumer, relies on imported aluminum ore due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from China‚Äôs low-grade ore. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology.</p>
