          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released on bail after being detained by ICE for six weeks; this article discusses her return to Massachusetts and the circumstances surrounding her detainment. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, citing an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas as the primary reason for her visa revocation. A federal judge agreed, noting the lack of evidence of criminal activity or violence. Ozturk was welcomed home by Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, who condemned her detention as a violation of free speech.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that "great progress" was made during trade negotiations with China in Geneva, Switzerland. U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and a Chinese delegation discussed many topics and reached agreements, though no major breakthroughs were announced. Trump described the agreement as "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner," emphasizing the desire for China to open up to American business. He has long supported tariffs to address the trade deficit and encourage the return of U.S. manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by targeting lower-tier cities amid sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales, but a transaction increase offset a decline in average spending. The company expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets, adding 665 stores in the past year. This strategy reflects efforts to maintain market share as price competition continues, though the long-term potential beyond wealthier cities remains to be seen.</p>

The four-time Pro Bowler, who spent 11 seasons in the league, made the decision after consulting with his family and reflecting on his career. Carr's retirement creates an opportunity for rookie Tyler Shough to compete for the starting position, while other quarterbacks on the Saints roster will also have a chance to prove themselves. The Saints are considering bringing in a veteran quarterback through free agency, but are currently focused on developing their younger players.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is bracing for an unusual atmospheric river event that could bring 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated areas potentially seeing up to 12 inches. The National Weather Service forecasts that Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina will be most affected. While atmospheric rivers typically hit the Western U.S., this event is caused by a "cutoff low" diverting the jet stream from the Gulf of Mexico. The precipitation could alleviate recent drought conditions in Florida, but also poses a risk of flooding in low-lying areas.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the US-Canada border are experiencing economic hardship due to the ongoing trade war and strained relations between the two countries. Since President Trump began imposing tariffs, border crossings have decreased by 17%, with Canadian car trips to the US dropping by almost 32%. This has led to a decline in business for restaurants, duty-free shops, and other businesses that rely on cross-border traffic. Border towns are also encouraging Canadians to "Buy Canadian" to support their own economy. These communities are facing a second economic hit after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down border crossings for 19 months.</p>

          <p>This article provides expert insights on how to win the Eurovision Song Contest, considering factors such as song themes, staging, key, and surprises. According to experts, songs of self-empowerment tend to do well, and simple, memorable staging can be more effective than extravagant displays. Minor-key songs dominate the contest, but some artists intentionally use major keys to stand out. Adding a surprise element, like a costume change or key change, can also increase a song's memorability and catchiness.</p>

          <p>In San Jose, California, police have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with the 1977 murder of Jeannette Ralston, a 24-year-old woman who was strangled. The case went cold until investigators ran fingerprints from the crime scene through an upgraded F.B.I. database, resulting in a match to Sims. The evidence included a thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the victim's car. DNA evidence also linked Sims to the crime, and his booking photo from a 1978 attempted murder case resembled the original sketch of the suspect.</p>

          <p>Jockey Junior Alvarado, who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for excessive use of the riding crop. The Kentucky Board of Stewards ruled that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times, exceeding the permitted six times under Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) rules. This is Alvarado's second violation in 180 days, leading to a doubled fine under HISA's escalating penalty structure. The fines will go to a jockey mental health program.</p>
