          <p>Following a decisive victory over Paris Saint-Germain to win the Club World Cup, Chelsea FC is reportedly feeling a new sense of belief in their ability to contend for the Premier League title. The young, talented squad, led by coach Enzo Maresca, demonstrated tactical discipline and aggressive play that has solidified internal momentum. Key players like Cole Palmer have been instrumental, and the integration of new talent such as João Pedro has transformed the attack. This achievement marks a significant step for the club, which now heads into the new season with heightened aspirations.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. This move is aimed at producing lower-cost battery cells for electric vehicles, as LFP technology does not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. The company expects commercial production of these more affordable batteries to begin by late 2027. This development is part of GM's broader strategy to diversify its EV portfolio and make electric vehicles more accessible to a wider market.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life, has now graduated from law school after helping to secure his own freedom. While incarcerated for over 28 years, Duncan became a "jailhouse lawyer," assisting hundreds of fellow inmates with their cases from behind bars. With the help of the Innocence Project of New Orleans, he was released in 2011 and later fully exonerated. His story of resilience and dedication to justice is detailed in his new memoir, "The Jailhouse Lawyer."</p>

          <p>Starbucks has officially integrated its popular but unofficial "secret menu" into its mobile app, allowing rewards members to easily order fan-created beverage combinations. The coffee giant launched the feature with four initial drinks and plans to add more regularly, streamlining the ordering process for both customers and baristas. This move is part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to revive the brand and improve customer service. The company is also hosting a contest for customers to submit their own custom drink ideas for a chance to win prize money.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the earnings potential of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs), noting that short-term rates are currently higher than is typical. It calculates potential returns on a $5,000 deposit and discusses the strategic choice savers face: either lock in today's high yields for a longer period to maximize total interest, or maintain flexibility with a shorter term in case the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this year, which would make current long-term rates more attractive.

Her candidacy must still be approved by Ukraine's parliament, but if confirmed, she would become the country's second female prime minister, tasked with steering the nation's executive branch through the conflict.</p>

          <p>This article explores the strategic implications of England finishing second in their Euro 2025 group, a result some fans were hoping for. By not winning the group, the Lionesses will face Sweden instead of eight-time champions Germany in the quarterfinals. Perhaps more importantly, they are now on the opposite side of the knockout bracket from 2023 World Cup winners Spain, meaning they cannot meet the tournament favorites until a potential final. While Sweden is a formidable opponent, the overall path to the final is now considered by many analysts to be more favorable.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female U.S. senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act," legislation aimed at improving vehicle safety for women, who are significantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed in car crashes than men. The act would require federal crash tests to use advanced dummies that better reflect the female anatomy, as the current standard dummy is based on an average-sized male from the 1990s. Advocates, including the family of a young woman killed in a crash, believe this data is crucial for designing safer cars for all drivers.</p>
