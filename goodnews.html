          <p>President Trump's military parade commemorating the Army's 250th birthday will include marching troops, tanks, and aircraft, alongside a unique addition: an Australian Cattle Dog named Doc Holliday, part of the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment from Fort Cavazos, Texas. Doc, who rides in a wagon pulled by mules, is experienced in parades, having participated twice in the Rose Parade. The parade, estimated to cost up to $45 million, is intended to strengthen the connection between America and its Army, featuring historical reenactments and equipment displays, though there will be no singing of "Happy Birthday" to Trump. The Golden Knights will parachute onto the White House Ellipse and offer the president a folded American flag.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' chief financial officer, Devon May, indicated that some travelers are avoiding Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions, opting for alternative airports like LaGuardia, JFK, or Philadelphia, though he cautioned that the impact is "modest." The FAA has ordered airlines to temporarily reduce flights at Newark to alleviate congestion caused by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction, further exacerbated by recent bad weather.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, hitting a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency's rise is attributed to positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value, further supported by a pro-crypto agenda from President Trump and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports to the U.S. led to a temporary increase in the drug's street price, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. The embargo, which added all fentanyl-related substances to China's list of controlled substances, may have prevented as many as 947 overdose deaths during that time. This is despite President Trump angering Beijing when he cited China‚Äôs involvement in the fentanyl trade as the reason for imposing tariffs in February.</p>

At the same time, the protein and dietary fiber decreased in the cereal brands.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a budget package that includes a provision to lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000, potentially providing tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or significant state income tax liabilities. The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts as a way to ease the tax burden for middle-class and working families. The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000, with a phaseout for those earning above that amount. If adopted, the higher SALT cap would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion titles. The review found that only about 20 books needed to be removed pending further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel. The initial ban used the Navy's own terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles from the libraries of their military educational institutions that touch on diversity, race, and gender issues using the Pentagon's specific search terms.</p>

This is the latest in a series of acquisitions for Honeywell, which has spent $11 billion on deals to boost growth, while simultaneously planning to split into three separate companies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are pitched as a way to ensure you won't outlive your money during retirement, but the reality is that these retirement products can also be quite confusing. Whether or not an annuity can run out of money depends heavily on the type of annuity you have. In general, immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent. However, fixed-term annuities, variable or indexed annuities, and annuities with withdrawal riders can run out of money. (not investment advice)</p>
