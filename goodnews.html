        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that Iran's nuclear ambitions were "obliterated" following U.S. strikes on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. Hegseth emphasized that the mission, authorized by President Trump, was a precision operation to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests and the collective self-defense of troops and ally Israel. He echoed Trump's remarks about the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, though the full extent of the damage remains unclear. Hegseth praised the operation as focused, powerful, and clear, reiterating that it was not about regime change in Iran, but about eliminating the threat of nuclear proliferation.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials disclosed new details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings. The U.S. also launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine against a site in Isfahan, and deployed deception tactics to ensure the safety of the aircraft. Caine warned Iran against retaliation and Defense Secretary Hegseth called the attack an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing it did not target Iranian troops or civilians.</p>

This move places South Korea in a global race alongside China and the United States, both of which have ongoing sixth-generation fighter programs. KAI's display at the air show included the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet, FA-50 light combat aircraft, and next-generation unmanned combat aircraft, highlighting the country's advancements in aerial warfare technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, calling the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites a "spectacular military success" and warning of further attacks if Iran does not "make peace." Trump stated the objective was to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran, and thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military for their contributions. The strikes targeted sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with American B-2 bombers dropping 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on Fordo and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles hitting the other sites. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes, but claimed they would not stop Iran from advancing its nuclear program.</p>

The election is seen as an opportunity for voters to signal their views on crucial national issues, including support for households grappling with inflation and political funding scandals involving the LDP.
