          <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK has announced that the April inflation rate was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to an error in car tax data. The annual rate was initially reported as 3.5%, but revised data shows it to be 3.4%. The error stemmed from incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, which overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates in the first year of registration. The ONS has apologized for the error and stated that the correctly weighted data will be used from May 2025 onward, with no further statistics affected.

          <p>Senate Republicans are proceeding with plans to modify President Trump's legislative package despite Elon Musk's opposition, with some senators dismissing Musk's influence. Musk had called for the bill to be scrapped, but senators like Kevin Cramer suggested Musk's expertise doesn't extend to governing. Senate Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to avoid a filibuster, requiring at least 51 GOP votes.

          <p>Louisiana's legislature has passed a new law outlawing attempts to gain a child's trust with the intent to sexually abuse them, championed by a survivor of Catholic clergy molestation, his wife, and her father, a state lawmaker. The law makes it illegal to pursue an intimate relationship with a child under 17 through manipulation, threats, or coercion with the intent to commit a sex offense. Authorities can act even if no abuse has taken place, applying when offenders are at least four years older than those being groomed. The law is set to go into effect on August 1, with hopes that it will inspire other states to adopt similar measures. The optimism score is separate from the summary.</p>
