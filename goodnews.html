        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House revealed a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing an earlier image that drew comparisons to a mugshot. In the new photograph, Trump is depicted staring directly into the camera, wearing a blue suit with a red tie, against a dark and blank backdrop. Art experts noted the more natural, yet still dramatic, lighting in the new portrait, contrasting with the up lighting used in the previous version. A White House official stated that the initial portrait was always intended as a placeholder, with the new portrait reflecting the "optimism and resolve of America."</p>

          <p>Dollar General's shares surged after the company raised its outlook, citing increased middle- and higher-income shoppers despite tariff concerns. The retailer beat quarterly expectations for revenue and earnings, anticipating net sales growth of 3.7% to 4.7%. CEO Todd Vasos stated the company has worked to reduce its exposure to China, minimizing price hikes for shoppers by cutting costs and moving manufacturing. Customer traffic dipped slightly, but shoppers spent more per visit, with sales growing in food, seasonal, home, and apparel categories.</p>

          <p>Two guests who experienced a bed bug infestation at a Ventura hotel have been awarded $2 million by a jury. The lawsuit alleged that Alvaro Gutierrez and Ramiro Sanchez suffered physical, emotional, and mental anguish as a result of their stay at the Shores Inn in 2020. The complaint claimed that the hotel management was aware of the bed bug problem but failed to eradicate the pests, exposing guests to harm. The attorney for the plaintiffs stated that the management was not taking good care of the place and had a history of bed bug issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, is off to a sluggish start, with muted inflows and little organic demand, according to recent data. The USD1 token, launched by Trump's decentralized finance firm, World Liberty Financial, has struggled to break out of a narrow speculative niche. Kaiko analyst Adam Morgan McCarthy noted that the coin has not managed to transition from decentralized platforms to centralized venues that serve the mass market. Donald Trump Jr. defended USD1 as a strategic asset for U.S. monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after being framed for murder by Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions in numerous cases. McDowell walked into CPD's Grand Central Area Headquarters in 1997 as a shooting victim, but was then framed as the perpetrator in an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify someone else.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of a new norovirus strain, GII.17, due to its potential to disrupt the seasonal pattern of outbreaks. Last year's norovirus season started in October, driven by GII.17, which has now become the dominant strain in the U.S. Researchers are questioning whether this new strain could cause norovirus season to arrive early again. Shifts in norovirus strains happen when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up to previous strains.</p>
