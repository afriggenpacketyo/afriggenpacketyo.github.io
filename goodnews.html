          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility more than three weeks after being shot. He and his wife, Yvette, were attacked in their home in what authorities describe as part of a series of politically motivated shootings that also killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The suspect, Vance Boelter, is in custody facing multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder. Hoffman's release marks a significant step in his recovery from the violent assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change will be rolled out at major airports, with the goal of expanding it nationwide shortly. This move aims to speed up security checkpoints, though passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove footwear for additional screening. The original policy was implemented in 2006, years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a transatlantic flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their higher education, shifting a long-standing trend. Students cite difficulties adjusting to cultural differences and increasing parental concerns about safety in the U.S. as key factors in their decision. Singapore is seen as an attractive alternative due to its high-quality universities, cultural familiarity, and perceived openness. While the U.S. has historically been the top destination, industry insiders predict Singapore will see a rise in applications from China amid the changing preferences.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved toward permanently ending "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels. An amendment was approved to prevent landlords from using renovations as a "just cause" for eviction unless they receive a specific order from a government agency to address code violations. This makes a temporary protection permanent and directs city departments to establish clear rules for tenant rights during legitimate renovations. These rules will cover relocation payments, provision of comparable temporary housing, and limits on rent increases upon return.</p>

          <p>In an effort to revive its tourism industry, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This change has been a boon for foreign tourists and travel companies, with one agency reporting that bookings to China have doubled. The policy, which has been progressively rolled out, is seen as a way to boost the economy and China's soft power. While most of Europe and many other regions are included, citizens from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. are not on the 30-day list.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) announced it will terminate its partnership with e-learning company Simplilearn in response to a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that the university and its partner misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp, misleading students by implying a close connection to Caltech faculty and resources when the link was minimal. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to transparency measures and will refund a total of $2.4 million in tuition to 263 students, marking a significant win for critics of university-branded online programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan to conduct large-scale layoffs in August, stating that a significant reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which eliminated the need for the planned cuts that could have affected up to 15% of the workforce. However, critics like Senator Richard Blumenthal argue this is not "natural" attrition but the result of a "toxic work environment" that is causing an unsustainable loss of employees.</p>

          <p>Veteran Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game as a special "Legend Pick" by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. The selection, which came as a surprise to Kershaw, recognizes his storied career accomplishments rather than his performance this season, as he has made only nine starts after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," stating that while it feels weird, he plans to enjoy the experience without taking an opportunity away from a more deserving first-time All-Star.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision spurred by the demonstrated vulnerability of such aircraft in modern warfare. Citing lessons from the war in Ukraine, officials highlighted the threat posed by advanced air defenses and cheap loitering munitions to low, slow-flying helicopters. The funds will be redirected toward investing in future-focused capabilities like drones and smart weapon systems, reflecting a significant strategic shift in the country's defense procurement priorities away from legacy platforms.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute participants of the city's recent Pride parade, despite the event being officially banned by the government. The decision comes after a record crowd of over 200,000 people defied the prohibition, which was enacted under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the march's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, as the reason for not pursuing fines or other legal action against attendees.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The ruling blocks a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targets health providers offering abortion services. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the law was an unconstitutional attack designed to punish the organization, which would have devastating consequences for patients who rely on its non-abortion services like cancer screenings. The order will remain in effect for 14 days pending further hearings.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally refused to comply with a Trump administration directive to prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. State officials rejected the federal government's conclusion that California's inclusive policy violates the civil rights of female students under Title IX. By defying the order, California risks an unspecified "imminent enforcement action," potentially including the withholding of federal education funding. The confrontation highlights the deep national divide over transgender rights and the interpretation of federal anti-discrimination law.</p>

Highlights include a carriage procession and a state banquet at Windsor Castle, where King Charles III is expected to deliver a speech emphasizing the two nations' shared history and the need to stand together against complex modern threats.
