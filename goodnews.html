          <p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly report as a public company. This growth was driven by a 90% surge in USDC circulation, solidifying its position as the second-largest stablecoin. Despite the strong revenue, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, largely due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, including stock-based compensation. Following the announcement, the company's shares saw a significant increase in premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany, often seen as laissez-faire, maintains a set of peculiar and strictly enforced regulations, particularly on Sundays and holidays. For instance, a "Tanzverbot," or dancing ban, is active on Good Friday in most states, with some regions also prohibiting screenings of certain films like "Life of Brian." Other quirky rules include bans on building large sandcastles on certain beaches to prevent erosion, prohibitions on mowing lawns on Sunday to ensure quiet time, and it being a finable offense to run out of fuel on the Autobahn.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 07:00:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25-year study from Northwestern University has explored why some individuals, termed "super agers," maintain exceptional memory performance well into their 80s. Researchers found that these individuals' brains resist the typical thinning of the cortex associated with aging. Some super agers showed a biological resistance to developing Alzheimer's-related proteins, while others showed resilience, maintaining cognitive health despite their presence. The study also noted that super agers tend to have strong social relationships, suggesting that cognitive decline is not an inevitable part of aging.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy soccer team is currently in a paradoxical position, sitting at the bottom of the Major League Soccer standings while simultaneously being one of the top four teams advancing in the Leagues Cup tournament. After a historically poor start to the MLS season, the team has shown a significant turnaround in recent matches without major roster changes. Team management and the coach attribute the early struggles to the time needed for the team to gel, especially in the midfield, and view their recent success as more representative of their true potential. The team now has opportunities to win two different trophies despite their poor league record.</p>

          <h2>Indian Consumer Inflation Eases for Ninth Consecutive Month, Reaching Lowest Point Since 2017</h2>

          <p>India's consumer price index for July showed inflation slowing to 1.55%, marking the ninth straight month of decline and hitting its lowest level since June 2017. The drop was primarily driven by a decrease in food price growth, coming in below analysts' expectations. This easing inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with potential room to loosen monetary policy and support the economy, especially as it faces trade tensions and tariffs from the United States. The central bank recently held its interest rate at 5.5%, noting a more benign inflation outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Presidents Trump and Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, this article revisits the history of the territory's sale from Russia to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million. Initially driven by the fur trade, Russia's presence in Alaska became a financial liability after its defeat in the Crimean War, prompting the sale. At the time, the deal was mocked in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," a purchase of a frozen wasteland, while some in Russia saw it as a humiliation. The subsequent discoveries of gold and oil transformed Alaska into a resource-rich state, making the acquisition one of history's greatest bargains.</p>

          <p>Maple, a nine-year-old springer spaniel, is assisting researchers at Michigan State University by sniffing out a deadly disease in honeybee colonies. After retiring from a career detecting human remains for law enforcement, Maple was trained to identify American foulbrood, a bacterial disease that kills bee larvae and can devastate hives. Wearing a custom-made protective bee suit, she can quickly screen hives, a crucial tool for beekeepers and scientists working to combat the decline of pollinators. The project not only aids bee conservation but also gives the high-energy, retired service dog a new sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>A summer leadership program run by the TODEC legal center is teaching children from immigrant families in Southern California about civic engagement. Against the backdrop of recent immigration enforcement raids that have affected their friends and families, the children are learning how to organize and advocate for solutions. In a mock city council meeting, the group of kids aged 4 to 17 voted to fund mental health workshops to address the fear in their community. The program aims to empower these children, giving them the tools and confidence to create positive change.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece serves as a counterpoint to suggestions that Los Angeles should withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics, labeling it a "bad idea." The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent meeting with President Trump as a necessary act of diplomacy for the good of the city. The article praises Los Angeles's successful history of hosting the Games in 1932 and 1984, both of which were profitable and culturally significant. The author argues that this legacy is too precious to abandon over political disagreements, emphasizing that the focus should remain on the athletes and the celebration.</p>
