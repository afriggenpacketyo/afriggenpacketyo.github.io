          <h2>Wealthy Chinese Investors Shift Focus Away from US Real Estate Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their capital away from the US real estate market. According to property agents, demand for homes costing over US$5 million has shifted towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. This trend marks a significant decline in Chinese investment in US homes, which has dropped more than 50 per cent since its peak in 2017, as buyers seek more welcoming alternatives. Geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals are cited as key factors discouraging Chinese investment in the US.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for Texas families. The program allows parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning programs, with families receiving $10,000 per year and children with disabilities qualifying for up to $30,000. Supporters argue it offers parents more options, while critics claim it will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. Starting next school year, up to 90,000 students can participate in the program, which could cost up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, ending the practice of selling EU citizenship in exchange for investments. The court found that the policy made nationality a "mere commercial transaction" and undermined solidarity between EU member states. While Malta's Prime Minister Abela defended the program, stating it had raised millions for charitable causes, the country will now have to rework the system. However, "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for real estate purchases or other major investments, remain in place in many EU countries, raising concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30 percent of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that this rate is even higher among people in their 20s, with over 60 percent of that group willing to switch to legal marriage if separate surnames were allowed. Common-law couples lack access to benefits available to legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights. While the main opposition party supports the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move.</p>
