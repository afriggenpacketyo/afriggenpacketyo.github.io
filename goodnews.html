          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption crackdown, focusing on strategically important industries such as big data, semiconductors, and tech giants, as part of its push for self-reliance and competition with the United States. Recent investigations in Guizhou province have targeted officials linked to the region's big data sector, including Li Gang, the director of the province's National Defence Science and Technology Industry Office. These efforts highlight the tension between state-led innovation and accountability, as Beijing seeks to ensure that corruption does not undermine its technological ambitions.</p>

The average American carries $67 in their wallet, but experts suggest keeping between $50 and $100 to cover typical expenses or a ride home. Some planners emphasize the value of cash during tech failures, citing instances like Hurricane Sandy where ATMs were out of service. One financial advisor now keeps a couple hundred dollars on hand after his credit card was declined due to suspected fraud. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is proposed as a way to raise highly successful children by creating a safe space for them to express their emotions. This approach focuses on being attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, and fostering trust through open conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. The practice also involves the parent doing internal work to become less reactive and creating an environment where the child feels safe to express their authentic self.</p>

          <p>Anne Tyler, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, discusses her "selfish motive" to explore other lives through her writing. She describes her writing as creating an "extremely believable lie" that allows readers to experience another person's life. Tyler finds inspiration in everyday conversations and observations, often overheard in public places, which she jots down in her "blue box." While Baltimore is a frequent setting in her novels, she claims it's due to "laziness" and her belief that there's more to discover in the average Baltimorean. She also shares insights into her latest book, "Three Days in June," and her approach to creating relatable characters.</p>

          <p>China and Russia leaders issued a joint statement avoiding wording that could irk Japan, with Beijing requesting the removal of such references to prevent damaging ties with the neighboring country. The deletion indicates China's attempt to stabilize relations with Japan, a U.S. security ally, amid intensifying tensions between Beijing and Washington. The original draft mentioned a commitment to "maintaining the security of Northeast Asia," which could suggest increased joint military activities near Japan. Japan has repeatedly expressed concerns over joint military exercises between the two countries.</p>

The Belarusian player demonstrated her dominance by winning nine consecutive games and showcasing her powerful serve and aggressive play. Despite being a three-time Grand Slam singles champion, Sabalenka has never reached the final of the French Open, with her best performance being a semi-final run in 2023. On this evidence, the 27-year-old is justifying her tag as one of the tournament favourites.</p>

She made a deal with the local Western Union office to be notified of telegrams and then personally delivered the news, offering comfort to the widows. Now, service members notify families in person and provide ongoing support, reflecting Moore's legacy of compassion and care.</p>

          <p>A civil war has broken out among Democratic wonks over the "abundance agenda," a set of policy reforms designed to make it easier to build housing and infrastructure and for government bureaucracy to work. Supporters see it as key to prosperity and enduring power for the liberal coalition, while critics decry it as a scheme by corporate-aligned interests. The debate reveals a deeper conflict over the nature and purpose of the Democratic Party, challenging the power of activist organizations and promising a positive identity for moderate Democrats.

          <p>Nearly 60% of Japanese people expect rice prices to fall under the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following his predecessor's dismissal over a controversial remark about receiving gifted rice. A Kyodo News survey indicated that most believe Koizumi, son of a former prime minister, will address the soaring rice prices. The survey also revealed that 44.7% believe rice prices should be brought below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, lower than recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The government plans to sell its stockpiled rice to retailers through direct contracts to stabilize prices.</p>
