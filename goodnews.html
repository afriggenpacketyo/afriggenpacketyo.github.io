          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed bullish sentiment on Take-Two Interactive, predicting its dominance in the video game sector following major competitor acquisitions. With Activision Blizzard acquired by Microsoft and Electronic Arts going private, Take-Two now stands as the sole major publicly traded American pure-play video game company, creating significant "scarcity value." The company, known for its Grand Theft Auto franchise, anticipates the highly awaited "Grand Theft Auto VI" release in May 2026. Cramer highlighted Take-Two's strong recent earnings, growing player accounts for GTA Online, and success with other franchises like NBA 2K. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal government will acquire a 10% ownership stake in Trilogy Metals, a Canadian-based company with mining claims in Alaska's remote Ambler Mining District. This $35.6 million investment, announced by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the White House, aims to secure critical mineral supplies for the U.S. President Trump also signed an executive order to boost Alaska's resource use and build a 200-mile road in the state. The move underscores a strategic effort to enhance domestic access to essential minerals, with the government also holding warrants for an additional 7.5% stake in the company.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to halt key parts of a judge's order requiring Alphabet's Google to make significant changes to its Play app store. This decision allows an injunction won by "Fortnite" maker Epic Games in its antitrust lawsuit to proceed, as Google prepares to appeal the full case. The injunction mandates Google to permit rival app stores within Play and allow developers to include external links, bypassing Google's billing system, with provisions taking effect by July 2026. Google has expressed concerns about reputational harm and security risks, but Epic argues the changes will benefit consumers and developers through increased competition.</p>

          <p>Parking in Los Angeles is set to become more expensive, with city leaders approving extended paid-parking hours and the first rate increase in over a decade. Meter prices will rise by 50 cents per hour across the city's 35,000 paid spaces by the end of October, with current rates ranging from $1 to $8.50 per hour. The City Council also approved charging for parking on Sundays and extending metered hours until midnight in nightlife areas, and 8 p.m. elsewhere. City officials state these changes aim to encourage vehicle turnover, support businesses, and generate an estimated $14.4 million for the city's financially strained budget.</p>

The album itself also broke Swift's previous sales records, selling 2.7 million physical and digital copies on its first day.</p>

          <p>Harry Kane has indicated he is open to discussing a new contract with Bayern Munich, signaling a potential long-term commitment to the German club. The England captain, who is halfway through his current four-year deal, has achieved significant success, scoring 103 goals in 106 appearances and winning his first career trophy. While he once considered a return to the Premier League, his interest has now "gone down a little bit," though he wouldn't rule it out entirely. Kane emphasized his current dedication to Bayern, driven by newfound motivation after winning the Bundesliga title.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is on restoring confidence and providing support for its private sector, which has faced years of sluggish demand and administrative penalties. Despite government measures, over 60 percent of private businesses describe the current climate as "difficult," with warnings of potential bankruptcies if conditions do not improve. The upcoming plan aims to shape China's development for the rest of the decade, raising questions about whether leaders can effectively empower entrepreneurs. This initiative is crucial for fostering competitiveness in an unpredictable global environment.</p>

          <p>Crime statistics for Memphis, Tennessee, are presenting conflicting narratives, with federal and local agencies reporting different trends. While the White House cited FBI data showing a rise in violent crime, the Memphis Police Department reported a six-year low in murder and other violent offenses. These discrepancies stem from differences in geographic scope (metro area vs. city limits) and counting methodology (victims vs. incidents). Experts emphasize the importance of understanding these nuances, definitions, and reporting gaps when interpreting crime data to avoid misrepresenting the reality of crime rates.</p>

          <p>China's decision to forgo its "developing country" status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) is being viewed as a strategic maneuver rather than a capitulation. While this status entitled China to special trade privileges, Beijing has largely conceded these in practice, instead using the label to align with the Global South. By relinquishing the designation, China removes a key talking point used by the U.S. and EU to criticize its trade practices. This tactical retreat allows China to reframe the global trade narrative, conserving resources and repositioning itself to outlast stronger adversaries in the long term.</p>

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned that OpenAI's recent deals with AMD and Nvidia are announcements, not deployments, emphasizing that "the best chips will win." These deals underscore the intensifying competitive landscape in the AI industry and the ongoing "compute scarcity" despite efforts to boost supply. Experts note that AI is a critical element in the geopolitical race between the U.S. and China, with Chinese rivals like DeepSeek innovating with domestically made AI chips. OpenAI's partnerships aim to increase production and build more complex AI models, crucial for the entire AI ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police have dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. This operation, described as the largest ever against phone thefts in the UK, led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. The investigation began when a victim traced a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport. The gang reportedly targeted Apple products due to their profitability overseas, with stolen devices selling for up to £4,000 each in China. This crackdown aims to address the tripling of phone thefts in London over the last four years.</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo, surpassed Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates for its fiscal second quarter but reiterated its previously lowered full-year guidance. The company cited a "challenging macroeconomic environment" and dampened consumer demand, including a trend of lower demand from Hispanic consumers potentially linked to President Trump's immigration policies. Net sales dropped 15% year-over-year, and operating margins were impacted by aluminum tariffs. Despite these headwinds, CEO Bill Newlands stated the company remains focused on strategic objectives like distribution gains and brand investment. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential expansion into traditional and new media platforms would grant him immense control over a vast array of information and entertainment outlets.
