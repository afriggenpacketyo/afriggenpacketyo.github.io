          <p>Former President Donald Trump will headline a fundraiser for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where the top sponsorship level is priced at $2 million. The event, hosted by the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, includes a VIP reception and the opening night performance of Les Mis√©rables. Trump, who chairs the board and recently appointed allies to leadership positions, will appear as a special guest but will not directly solicit donations. This move follows Trump's overhaul of the center's management, which sparked controversy and cancellations from some shows.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" in response to President Trump's suggestion of making it the 51st U.S. state. Trump, while praising Carney, insisted that such a merger would be a "wonderful marriage," but Carney emphasized Canada's commitment to its sovereignty. The leaders also discussed trade, with Trump suggesting a renegotiation of the USMCA trade deal and expressing a desire for the U.S. to become economically independent from Canada. Carney's Liberal Party recently won elections on a platform of resisting Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Utah will become the first state in the U.S. to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite warnings from dentists and health experts about potential harm to tooth development. Governor Spencer Cox signed the law, arguing that people should not be given fluoride by the government without informed consent. Robert F Kennedy Jr., the US health secretary, applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide. Dentists in Salt Lake City expect an increase in tooth decay, especially among young patients without regular access to dental care.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>If a debt collector refuses a settlement offer, it doesn't necessarily mean the end of negotiations; it simply indicates that the offer isn't acceptable at that moment. Debt collectors often reject offers if they are too low, if the debt is recent, or if they believe you can pay more. To improve the chances of settling debt, it's important to do your homework, offer proof of hardship, and consider working with a debt relief expert who can negotiate effectively. Patience and persistence are key, as settlement negotiations can take time and require consistent follow-up.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank statement loans offer a mortgage option for self-employed individuals, independent contractors, and business owners who may not have traditional income documentation. These loans rely on business bank statements to prove income and expenditures, providing flexibility for borrowers who don't qualify for conventional mortgages. While bank statement loans have more flexible standards, they often come with higher interest rates and require larger down payments. Borrowers still need a good credit score and sufficient income history to qualify, but this type of loan can be a viable alternative for those with non-traditional income sources.
