          <h2>India to Tighten Rules on Overseas Remittances, Sources Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 01:21:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is planning to tighten rules for overseas remittances by resident Indians, according to government sources. The RBI will amend regulations to prevent overseas transfers from being used to park money in time deposits or other interest-bearing accounts abroad. The proposed changes reflect India's cautious stance on outward remittances and the full convertibility of the rupee. The RBI aims to ensure that such deposits cannot be made even under alternate names. The score is 60. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, marking a significant step towards easing tensions between the two countries. The move, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, is part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea had resumed the broadcasts in June last year in retaliation for North Korea's trash-laden balloon campaign. The decision reflects the new government's commitment to improving relations with Pyongyang. The score is 70.</p>
