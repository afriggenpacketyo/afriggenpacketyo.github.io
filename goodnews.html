        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Carolina has been ranked as the top state for business in America for 2025, according to a comprehensive CNBC study. The state's success is attributed to its strong economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly policies, attracting major investments from companies like Amazon and JetZero. However, the article notes significant challenges, including a low ranking for quality of life and worker protections. Potential headwinds from federal budget cuts and the economic impact of recent hurricanes could also affect its future business climate.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, causing its stock to surge after announcing that travel bookings have stabilized. While overall demand is lower than initially projected at the start of the year, the airline reported strong growth in premium seat sales and its partnership with American Express. CEO Ed Bastian noted that travelers are booking closer to their travel dates, prompting surgical adjustments to flight capacity. The company now projects full-year adjusted earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 per share, revising an earlier, more optimistic forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's burgeoning drone industry is exploring opportunities to export its battle-tested technology, positioning itself as a key partner in rearming Europe. Having developed rapidly during the war with Russia, Ukrainian companies leverage unique battlefield experience and data, though they face competition from well-funded European firms. The Ukrainian government is now considering loosening export restrictions to attract investment and fund further development. This move could allow for joint ventures and production outside Ukraine, addressing security concerns and balancing domestic needs with international market potential.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., through a $400 million investment. This strategic move aims to expand domestic processing capacity and magnet production, reducing American dependence on China for these critical minerals. The investment will fund a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the Pentagon guaranteeing the purchase of its output for ten years. The deal underscores the Trump administration's initiative to secure national supply chains for essential defense and commercial materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At its recent biennial seminar, OPEC officials and energy leaders focused on three key themes: the green energy transition, the future oil outlook, and the need for increased investment. Ministers advocated for a pragmatic approach to the transition, emphasizing continued investment in oil and gas to ensure energy security while renewable sources are scaled up. The group's latest World Oil Outlook projects that oil demand will continue to grow through 2050, driven by developing economies. Consequently, leaders stressed the urgent need for trillions in new investment to boost production capacity and meet future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a thought-provoking analysis, economist Dean Spears challenges the long-held belief that a smaller global population is inherently better for the planet. He argues that the current trajectory of falling birth rates could lead to an unprecedented and continuous population decline, which would stifle innovation, scientific progress, and economic vitality. Spears suggests that rather than an unending decline, humanity should aim for population stabilization, which requires a careful, non-politicized conversation about making it easier for people to have children. He emphasizes that this requires addressing systemic issues like gender inequality, rather than resorting to traditionalist or coercive measures.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has comfortably survived a no-confidence vote initiated by a far-right faction in the European Parliament. The motion, which criticized her over issues like the transparency of COVID-19 vaccine contracts, was defeated with 360 votes in her favor. While the outcome was expected, the debate provided an opportunity for center-left groups to voice grievances and secure policy commitments from von der Leyen. The event highlighted the fractured political landscape of the parliament and ongoing tensions between the EU's executive branch and various political factions.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with the recent, highly disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers Marks & Spencer and the Co-op. A 20-year-old woman and three teenage males were detained on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other computer misuse offenses. The attacks, which began in mid-April, involved data theft and the deployment of ransomware, causing significant operational chaos and financial damage.

          <p>At a rebuilding conference in Rome, European leaders, alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called for private businesses to invest in Ukraine's recovery now, despite the ongoing war. The conference aims to unlock over 10 billion euros in investments through guarantees and grants, with Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni framing reconstruction not as a risk, but as an opportunity. The event took place amid uncertainties over future U.S. military support for Kyiv and as Russia launched another heavy missile attack on the capital.
