          <p>Australia's Reserve Bank has surprisingly maintained its policy interest rate at 3.85%, diverging from economists' expectations of a rate cut. The RBA stated it needs more time to assess inflation data to ensure it is sustainably on track to reach its 2.5% target. This decision comes despite recent data showing inflation at a four-year low, prompting criticism from the country's treasurer who highlighted the government's progress in combating the cost of living. The Australian dollar strengthened following the announcement amid a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new malaria treatment specifically formulated for babies weighing less than 4.5kg (10lbs) has been approved, addressing a critical gap in pediatric care. Previously, infants were treated with medications designed for older children, which carried a significant risk of overdose due to their developing liver functions. Developed by Novartis in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture, the drug is expected to be rolled out in African countries on a not-for-profit basis within weeks. This breakthrough is hailed as a major step in reducing the high mortality rate among children under five.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:54:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes at many major U.S. airports. According to an internal memo, the change, which began Sunday, aims to speed up screening processes and will eventually be rolled out nationwide. The policy shift marks a significant change from the rule implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident. Passengers who trigger screening alarms will still be required to remove their footwear for additional checks, but the move brings standard lanes closer to the TSA PreCheck experience.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection into the inner ear, has successfully improved hearing in children and adults with a specific form of congenital deafness. In a clinical trial, researchers used a harmless virus to deliver a functional copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants showed considerable hearing improvement within six months, with younger children responding best. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, representing a significant breakthrough with potential to treat other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Students Increasingly Prefer Singapore Over US for Higher Education</h2>

          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, with some now preferring it over the United States. Factors driving this shift include cultural similarities, perceived safety, and a more open economic environment in Singapore. In contrast, Chinese students in the U.S. report difficulties with cultural adjustment and growing safety concerns from their families. While the U.S. has historically been the top choice, industry insiders predict Singapore's universities will see a rise in applications from China amid growing instability and uncertainty in America.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has advanced a measure to permanently restrict "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel to charge higher rents. The new amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent landlords from evicting tenants for renovations unless they have a formal order from a government agency citing housing code violations. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated during necessary remodels, either with monetary compensation or by providing comparable temporary housing at the landlord's expense, protecting renters from displacement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to revive its tourism sector and economy, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This policy has led to a noticeable, though still modest, increase in foreign visitors, with tour operators reporting a surge in bookings, particularly from European travelers. The move simplifies travel by eliminating a costly and time-consuming visa application process. While most North American countries are not on the 30-day list, they are eligible for a more restrictive 10-day transit option.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will terminate its partnership with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that a jointly offered cybersecurity boot camp was misrepresented, misleading students into believing it had close ties to the prestigious university when the connection was minimal. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to over 260 students. The university will also establish a faculty oversight committee for its other professional education programs, marking a significant development in the scrutiny of university partnerships with online program managers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force that could have laid off tens of thousands of employees in August. The VA now expects to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through a federal hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition, eliminating the need for mass layoffs. The initial plan, aimed at returning staff levels to those of 2019, would have required cutting over 80,000 jobs. Critics, however, argue the high attrition rate is due to a toxic work environment and will inevitably harm services for veterans.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th All-Star team, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the veteran pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that while his performance this season might not typically warrant a selection, he intends to enjoy the experience. The pick places him in the company of other legends like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera who received similar honors.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing cost increases and the platform's vulnerability on the modern battlefield. A member of the National Assembly noted that the war in Ukraine has demonstrated the significant threat posed by advanced air defenses and drones to low-flying helicopters. Instead of investing in legacy platforms, the funds will be redirected toward developing drones and other advanced smart systems. The decision reflects a growing global reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role in high-intensity conflicts against peer adversaries.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against the thousands who participated in the city's Pride parade, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. The decision comes after Budapest's liberal mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declared the march an official municipal event, creating a legal gray area. Authorities stated that participants likely believed the event was legal due to organizers' comments. The move is a setback for Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government, which has enacted a series of anti-LGBTQ+ laws and described the parade as "repulsive and shameful."</p>
