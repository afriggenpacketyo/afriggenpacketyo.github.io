          <p>This article examines the concept of the seven-day week, tracing its origins to the Bible and arguing for its relevance in modern society. It contrasts the 20th-century view of work as a necessary evil with the current culture of "crazy busyness," advocating for a balance between meaningful work and sacred rest. Drawing on historical research and contemporary studies, the article posits that productivity plateaus after 55 hours of work per week, suggesting that adhering to a six-day work week with a day of rest aligns with both biblical wisdom and optimal productivity. The article also references Joseph from the Bible as a model for finding meaning in work, regardless of the job itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Stephanie Venn-Watson, a veterinary epidemiologist, discovered C15:0, a saturated fatty acid, to be a key nutrient for longevity. Venn-Watson and her team discovered a new essential fatty acid, C15:0, which like omega-3‚Ä≤s, can improve health outcomes in mammals. To increase her intake of C15:0, she eats certain foods that are high in this fatty acid. She developed a C15:0 supplement and published a book on her findings. Her discovery marks the "first essential fatty acid to be found in more than ninety years," a finding which earned Venn-Watson a spot on CNBC's 2025 Changemakers List earlier this year.</p>
