          <p>European stock markets saw gains, driven by positive corporate news in the defense and healthcare sectors. A significant £10 billion warship deal between the U.K. and Norway elevated shares for defense companies like BAE Systems. Meanwhile, Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's stock climbed after new trial data indicated its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, is more effective at reducing heart disease risks than competing products from Eli Lilly. The positive market sentiment comes as investors also analyze mixed manufacturing data from China. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from a prominent Beijing investment bank, CICC, indicates that Chinese exporters are absorbing only about 9% of the cost burden from U.S. tariffs. The analysis suggests that American importers are bearing the majority of the financial impact, often by reducing their own profit margins. According to the study, this dynamic demonstrates the strong competitive advantage and bargaining power of Chinese goods in the global market, as they have not needed to significantly lower their prices to offset the tariffs.

Baker's selection follows an impressive performance in The Hundred tournament, where his high-speed bowling caught the attention of team captain Harry Brook. This marks a significant step in Baker's rapid career progression, as he joins a team that is rebuilding ahead of the 2027 50-over World Cup. The series marks Brook's second as the full-time white-ball captain.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced it will enhance safety measures for its AI chatbots to prevent them from discussing sensitive topics like suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders with teenage users. Instead, the chatbots will direct teens to expert resources when such subjects are raised. This decision follows an investigation by a U.S. senator and growing concerns over the potential for AI to negatively influence vulnerable users. The move is part of a broader effort by the company to create a safer online environment for younger users on its platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that California, despite leading the U.S. in electric vehicle adoption, is missing a significant opportunity by not promoting midday charging at workplaces. Charging EVs during the day utilizes abundant and cheap solar energy, which can cut emissions far more effectively than overnight charging powered by natural gas. The author, part of a UC San Diego research team, suggests that stronger incentives, better electricity pricing models, and an expansion of reliable workplace charging networks are needed to shift driver habits. This change would better utilize renewable energy that is often wasted.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that as artificial intelligence automates technical skills, the most valuable human traits will be moral and interpersonal ones like empathy, judgment, and character. The author argues against a sole focus on STEM, suggesting that a traditional liberal arts education is the best preparation for the future. By engaging with foundational texts and complex questions, students develop critical thinking, attention, and communication skills that AI cannot replicate. The article posits that this kind of deep, humanistic education fosters the wisdom needed to navigate a technologically advanced world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the vulnerability and social risks associated with sharing a favorite movie, book, or album with a friend. It explains that because personal taste is a reflection of identity, a friend's negative reaction can feel like a personal rejection. Psychologists note that people tend to befriend those with similar tastes, and a disagreement can reveal that a friendship is not as close as one believed. The piece uses the author's personal experience of showing "The Big Lebowski" to a friend to illustrate the common anxiety and ultimate relief in these situations.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned train operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, significantly reducing costs for weekday commuters. The move aims to incentivize more people to travel by train instead of by car, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow becoming nearly 50% cheaper. This policy follows a pilot scheme that ended in 2024, which was revived by First Minister John Swinney. While the previous trial was deemed not self-financing, the government is investing in the new system to support residents amid financial struggles.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai has appointed two younger officials, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. This move is seen as an effort to bring in fresh perspectives to address the complex challenges posed by Beijing and the current U.S. administration. The appointments follow a drop in approval ratings for Lai and his party, particularly among young voters. By blending veteran experience with younger talent, Lai's administration aims to enhance its ability to navigate a rapidly changing global political landscape.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant shake-up of his Downing Street staff one year into his premiership, creating new roles and clarifying leadership structures. The changes, which include appointing a new Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister, are an implicit acknowledgment that his government's first year has not gone as planned. The restructuring emphasizes economic expertise and is aimed at improving the government's ability to "deliver" on its priorities. However, critics within the Labour party suggest the core issue is not a lack of delivery but a lack of a clear vision.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has thrown out the state's congressional map, ruling it an illegal partisan gerrymander and ordering the Republican-led legislature to draw a new one. This decision transforms the deeply conservative state into an unexpected focal point in the national fight over redistricting. The current map divides the Democratic-leaning Salt Lake City area across four districts, diluting its electoral power. A redrawn map could create a more competitive district, potentially giving Democrats a rare opportunity in a state that President Trump has criticized for its "Radical Left Judges."</p>

In recent weeks, Seoul has also dismantled some of the propaganda loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border. Despite these goodwill gestures, North Korea has so far shown little interest in improving inter-Korean relations.</p>

          <p>A section of the defunct Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a luxury housing complex named Overland & Ayres, built on the site of a former Macy's parking structure. The 201-unit complex is part of a broader trend of repurposing dead or dying shopping malls for new uses like housing and offices. The rest of the iconic mall, famous for its appearance in the film "Clueless," is being converted by UCLA into a major research center. This redevelopment reflects the high demand for housing in Los Angeles.</p>
