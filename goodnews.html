          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers extended their winning streak to seven games with a thrilling 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. The game concluded with a spectacular defensive play in the ninth inning when center fielder Blake Perkins threw out the potential tying run, Starling Marte, at home plate. Perkins delivered a perfect one-hop throw to catcher William Contreras, who applied the tag to end the game. The win continues the Brewers' hot streak, while the Mets have now lost five straight games and nine of their last ten.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers, which had broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music across the border. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaigns had heightened tensions amid North Korea's advancing nuclear program. The move is seen as a reciprocal gesture after South Korea's new liberal government halted its broadcasts in a bid to improve relations, though Pyongyang has previously rebuffed diplomatic overtures from the new administration.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. A University of Georgia planetary geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which originated from a larger meteor that exploded over the state in June. The scientist concluded that the meteorite came from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and was likely part of a much larger asteroid that broke up 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite recovered in Georgia.</p>

The crew, consisting of two U.S. astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, completed a 148-day mission where they conducted over 200 scientific experiments. Their return marks the conclusion of NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation. The mission was notable for replacing the Crew-9 astronauts who had been stranded on the ISS for an extended period due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made an emotional return to Old Trafford, playing for Fiorentina in a pre-season friendly. De Gea, who left the club two summers ago after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd of over 60,000, giving him the farewell he was not afforded in 2023. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with Manchester United winning the subsequent penalty shootout 5-4. De Gea's return has reignited debate among fans about the club's decision to replace him, especially as his successor, Andre Onana, is currently injured.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers Matt Linde and Udi Kore secured a 99-year ground lease and invested over $104 million to renovate the historic St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating since 1972. The project preserved original architectural elements like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities and a new wing. The building includes 62 affordable housing units, with market-rate apartments renting for between $3,130 and $6,950 per month.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Known for his integrity, Webster was appointed to head the FBI from 1978 to 1987, where he helped restore public confidence after a period of scandal. He then led the CIA from 1987 to 1991, again tasked with stabilizing an agency mired in controversy, particularly the Iran-Contra affair. A former federal judge, Webster was widely respected as a troubleshooter with no political agenda who prioritized the rule of law.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, now suggests a revised figure of 4.7% for the most conservative retirees. His updated research incorporates a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, which he argues allows for a higher safe withdrawal rate. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and suggests that for today's economic climate, a withdrawal rate around 5.25% to 5.5% could be appropriate, emphasizing the need for personalization.

Growing up as the daughter of a renowned anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch devoted her career to perfecting the art of flower painting. Her work is known for its scientific accuracy, vibrant detail, and complex compositions that often yoked together blooms from different seasons and continents, reflecting the global reach of the Dutch empire and the era's fascination with botany.</p>
