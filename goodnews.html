          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 3% in September, slightly below economists' forecasts of 3.1%, indicating inflation continued to climb but at a cooler pace. This data is crucial for determining Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment. Economists attribute the inching inflation partly to Trump administration tariffs, with businesses absorbing some costs while passing up to 55% onto consumers. Despite this, the Federal Reserve is still expected to consider a rate cut due to a significant slowdown in job growth, balancing its dual mandate of low inflation and unemployment.

Known for her elegance and dedication, Queen Sirikit was considered a key maternal figure for the nation, with her birthday traditionally celebrated as Mother's Day.

          <p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates made a surprising cameo in the popular Indian TV drama "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," appearing alongside actress and former minister Smriti Irani. His appearance aimed to raise awareness about maternal and child health, an area where the Gates Foundation has significant work in India. The show, which recently returned for a second run, uses its broad reach to weave social messaging into its narratives, demonstrating how storytelling can inform and inspire on critical issues.

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen demonstrated strong performance by topping Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and setting a competitive tone for the weekend. Meanwhile, title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri of McLaren struggled significantly, with Piastri finishing 12th and notably off the pace on both short and long runs. Verstappen, despite complaining of a lack of grip, has been making up ground on championship leader Piastri in recent races. The session saw no major incidents, but McLaren's slower pace compared to Red Bull raises concerns for their performance in the upcoming qualifying and race.</p>

          <h2>The Shifting Debate: Manual Versus Automatic Driving Lessons Amidst Electric Vehicle Transition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing dilemma for new drivers in the UK: whether to learn in a manual or automatic car, a decision influenced by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. With electric vehicles lacking manual gearboxes, automatic cars now constitute one-third of vehicles on UK roads, and a quarter of driving tests are taken in automatics. While manual licenses offer broader driving freedom and cheaper lessons, many learners face a scarcity of automatic instructors and higher costs. The debate also touches on the lingering "stigma" of automatic-only licenses, though this is likely to diminish as EVs become standard.</p>

          <p>The counting of votes has commenced for the Irish presidential election, which will determine the 10th Irish president to succeed current head of state Michael D Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders, Catherine Connolly and Heather Humphreys, although Jim Gavin's name remained on the ballot despite his earlier withdrawal. Early unofficial indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. The results are expected to be officially announced later today at Dublin Castle, following months of campaigning by the candidates.</p>

          <h2>Investigating Magnesium's Role as a "Miracle Mineral" for Sleep and Health Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article delves into the booming market for magnesium supplements, often touted as a "miracle mineral" for sleep, digestion, and mental health, driven largely by social media influencers. While magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including brain function and blood sugar regulation, experts caution that supplements are only beneficial if one is deficient. There's limited strong evidence for many specific magnesium compounds to improve sleep in healthy individuals. Nutritionists advise prioritizing dietary sources like nuts and greens, and consulting professionals, as excessive intake can lead to adverse effects or be dangerous for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has hired 36 new immigration judges, including 25 temporary ones, marking the first recruitment wave after months of significant workforce cuts. These judges, many with federal government or military legal backgrounds, will be deployed across 16 states to address the backlog of millions of immigration cases. The Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies and rapid arrests have exacerbated this backlog, which saw over 125 judges depart the EOIR in the past 10 months. The new hires aim to restore integrity and efficiency to the immigration courts.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ruled that the University of California must publicly release the Trump administration's $1.2 billion settlement proposal for UCLA, a significant win for faculty advocating for transparency. The document outlines federal demands for policy changes at UCLA regarding antisemitism complaints, admissions, and gender identity, in exchange for restoring suspended research funding. UCLA faculty leaders, who sued for the disclosure, plan to distribute the 28-page proposal publicly. The university had argued that public release would harm negotiations and invite an "uncontrollable public fray."</p>
