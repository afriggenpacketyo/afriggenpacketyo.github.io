          <p>Sources indicate that the royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as Air Force One, potentially to be gifted shortly before he leaves office. The plane would undergo security checks for spying devices before acceptance. However, Qatar's Media Attach√© disputes reports of an immediate gift during Trump's visit, stating the matter is under review by legal departments. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has urged an investigation into the ethics of accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign government, citing potential violations of federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering tightening English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents as part of a broader overhaul of the immigration system. Migrants may also need to wait 10 years to apply for settlement instead of five, with a fast-track option for skilled workers in fields like nursing and AI. Critics warn the new rules may split families, while supporters argue they will encourage integration and reduce exploitation. These changes aim to create a more controlled, selective, and fair immigration system, addressing public concerns about net migration.</p>

Trump praised the talks for a "total reset" in the relationship. Despite the positive tone, an escalating trade war has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with 125% levies on some US goods.</p>
