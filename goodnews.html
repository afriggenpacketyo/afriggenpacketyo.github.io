          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow for a state visit, aiming to strengthen the relationship with Russia amid trade tensions with the United States and skepticism from European allies. Xi expressed confidence that his meeting with President Putin would enhance bilateral cooperation and inject momentum into their comprehensive strategic partnership. He emphasized the friendship between the two nations, describing them as reliable neighbors and partners. The visit occurs against a backdrop of reported Ukrainian drone activity near Moscow, which temporarily disrupted airport operations, adding a layer of geopolitical context to the discussions.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts publicly defended the independence of the judiciary, cautioning against the impeachment of judges due to disagreements with their rulings. Speaking at an event in Buffalo, his hometown, Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not the proper way to register disagreement with judicial decisions. His remarks follow similar comments by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who denounced attacks on judges and harassment that undermine the Constitution. Roberts's defense of judicial independence comes amid scrutiny of federal judges and pressure on the Supreme Court, particularly in cases challenging the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Representative Thomas Massie was the sole lawmaker to vote against the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act, a bill aimed at cracking down on the Chinese Communist Party's alleged practice of forced organ harvesting. Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, stated his opposition stems from a belief that the U.S. should not interfere in other countries' affairs. The bill, which passed with overwhelming support, authorizes the Secretary of State to deny passports and visas to individuals involved in organ trafficking and calls for sanctions against those participating in the illicit industry.</p>

Means, known for her focus on functional medicine and criticism of the pharmaceutical and food industries, is expected to work closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to implement the administration's health agenda. Means's views on vaccines and the FDA have raised concerns, but her appointment aligns with the administration's emphasis on alternative approaches to health and nutrition.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led bans on flying pride flags on government property in Utah and Idaho, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds. Salt Lake City approved three new city flags incorporating the pride flag, trans flag, and Juneteenth flag, while Boise declared the pride flag an official city flag.

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a boost following the Trump administration's decision to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce confirmed the plan, stating the rule was overly complex and stifled American innovation. Chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, have opposed the restrictions, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressing concerns about being locked out of the Chinese AI market. The move is expected to unleash American innovation and bolster the U.S. chip industry.</p>
