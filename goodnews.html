        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders, this time targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey. The ruling declared the order unconstitutional, marking a consistent legal rebuke of the administration's campaign to punish firms representing clients or causes it opposes. These executive orders have sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. While several firms have settled with the administration, four have successfully challenged the orders in court, with judges defending the independence of the legal profession against executive overreach.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and crowd-pleasing set of their greatest hits after a long hiatus. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more subdued performance, lacking some of the wilder antics of past shows. While musically tight, the set was described by some as feeling safe, though it was filled with fan favorites that prompted massive singalongs. Near the end of the show, Healy explained the band's deliberate avoidance of political commentary for the night, stating a desire for their legacy to be about love and friendship.</p>

Cramer anticipates a weak report from Constellation Brands, suggesting the alcohol sector faces headwinds from GLP-1 weight loss drugs and changing consumer preferences.

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a five-wicket performance from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets after initially showing promise in their pursuit of a 301-run target. Hazlewood's controlled bowling spell triggered a collapse from which the hosts could not recover, despite some late resistance. The decisive win gives Australia a strong start to the series, concluding the match with two full days to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double its annual tax incentives for film and television production, increasing the fund from $330 million to $750 million. This move is a significant effort to counteract the trend of productions moving to other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. The state has experienced a notable decline in production and a loss of thousands of industry jobs in recent years. Industry unions and producers have applauded the decision, hoping it will encourage studios to recommit to filming in Hollywood's home state and bring work back to local crews.</p>

The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023. A previous proposal for a 60-day ceasefire was accepted by Israel but met with amendments from Hamas that were deemed unacceptable by a U.S. envoy.

          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly increased his recommended allocation to cryptocurrencies, now suggesting that investors should consider holding 10% to 40% of their portfolios in the asset class. This is a substantial shift from his earlier advice of a low single-digit allocation. Edelman attributes this change to the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset, with major questions about government bans and institutional adoption now largely resolved. He also argues that increased human longevity makes the traditional 60/40 stock-bond model obsolete, creating a need for higher-return assets like crypto. (not investment advice)</p>
