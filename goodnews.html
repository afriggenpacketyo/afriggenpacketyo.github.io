          <p>Following the U.S.-brokered peace deal, European leaders are exploring ways to play a more significant role in the region's future beyond providing reconstruction funds for Gaza. The EU has expressed readiness to contribute to a proposed temporary transitional government and an International Stabilization Force, although commitments from individual nations like France and Germany are still under consideration. However, Europe's influence may be limited, as it was largely sidelined during negotiations and has yet to secure a seat on the U.S.-led "Board of Peace" that will oversee the plan's implementation.</p>

The update also includes a more restrictive "Limited Content" option for parents and applies similar age-appropriate standards to the platform's integrated AI features.</p>

          <p>Actress and producer Reese Witherspoon has co-written her debut novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," with bestselling author Harlan Coben. The book features an Army combat surgeon, Maggie McCabe, who becomes entangled in an international conspiracy, a character Witherspoon created to challenge the male dominance of the action genre. Witherspoon drew inspiration from her parents' military medical careers to develop the protagonist and hopes the novel will be the first in a series that could be adapted for film or television.</p>

An indictment was unsealed against Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of the scheme, who remains at large and is accused of running the operation through his Cambodia-based conglomerate, Prince Holding Group. Prosecutors state that the group used forced labor in scam compounds to defraud victims worldwide, convincing them to transfer cryptocurrency under false pretenses of profitable investments.</p>

          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is enjoying a stellar start to the season with his new club, Napoli, prompting questions about whether Manchester City allowed him to leave prematurely. The 34-year-old, who was deemed surplus to requirements at City, has demonstrated he can still perform at an elite level, with his goal and assist contributions outshining most of his former club's current midfielders. While City has had a solid start to their campaign, De Bruyne's success in Italy suggests he could have remained a key asset for the Premier League champions.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Home Ownership When Utilizing a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 11:24:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly loan payments, but it raises questions about ownership. Homeowners who take out a reverse mortgage retain the legal title and ownership of their house; the lender does not take possession but places a lien on the property to secure the loan. The loan balance, including interest and fees, becomes due when the borrower sells the home, moves out, or dies, at which point the heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the house or sell it to settle the debt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the early stages of the criminal case against him, former FBI Director James Comey has won a procedural fight regarding access to discovery materials. U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff rejected a Justice Department motion for a protective order that would have limited Comey's access, stating it would "unnecessarily hinder and delay" his trial preparation. This ruling aligns with the judge's swift litigation schedule, which sets a January trial date for Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to and obstructing Congress brought by a Trump-appointed prosecutor.</p>
