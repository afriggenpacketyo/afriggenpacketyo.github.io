          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced its readiness for mass production of next-generation HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips, crucial for AI computing. This development positions the company ahead of rivals like Samsung and Micron, particularly as HBM4 is anticipated to be a key component for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. The announcement led to a significant surge in SK Hynix's stock, reflecting strong investor confidence and the company's dominant market leadership in HBM technology. This strategic move is expected to further boost its record profits from HBM demand.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper secured its first in-flight Wi-Fi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its race to catch up with SpaceX's Starlink in the satellite internet market. While Kuiper has a comparatively small number of satellites in orbit, this deal injects new competition into a sector where Starlink has been a dominant player. The global satellite internet market is rapidly expanding, with numerous LEO satellites planned for deployment, driven by the anticipated rollout of 6G communications and the need to connect unserved populations worldwide.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old wedding mystery from Ayrshire, Scotland, has been solved after an internet appeal identified a man seen puzzled in wedding photos. Andrew Hillhouse, the mystery guest, revealed he mistakenly attended Michelle and John Wylie's wedding, believing it was another ceremony two miles away. He only realized his error when the bride walked down the aisle, but felt committed to staying. The mix-up, which saw him inadvertently join group photos, provided a humorous resolution to a long-standing puzzle for the couple and their guests.</p>

          <p>Wayne Rooney, Manchester United's all-time top scorer, reminisced about the infamous 6-1 Manchester derby defeat to City in 2011, describing it as a "horrible" experience. Despite the crushing loss, Rooney attended his pre-planned birthday party that night, which included rival City players like Joe Hart. He admitted, in hindsight, he "should have cancelled" the event. Rooney also recalled scoring an iconic overhead kick in a 2011 derby, a goal he considers memorable due to the rivalry, despite his poor overall performance in that particular match.</p>

          <p>Steve Reed, the new UK Housing Secretary, affirmed the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, calling it a "crisis" that requires aggressive action. He vowed to remove barriers to construction and threatened sanctions against developers who delay projects. This ambitious target was a key Labour election pledge, but industry leaders warn of significant challenges due to rising costs and planning delays. Reed also stated the government is exploring options to house asylum seekers without burdening the existing housing market.</p>

          <p>Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murder victim Stephen Lawrence, has made an impassioned plea for new witnesses to come forward as an independent review of her son's case begins. Triggered by a BBC investigation, the review by the College of Policing will examine Metropolitan Police information for outstanding inquiries, aiming for "complete justice." Stephen Lawrence was killed in a racist attack in 1993, and while two murderers were convicted in 2012, other suspects remain free. Baroness Lawrence hopes this is the "last opportunity" to achieve full closure after 32 years.</p>

          <p>California's Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and enable high-density housing near public transit. The legislation, which could allow buildings up to nine stories, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage but faces strong opposition from critics who view it as state overreach. Concerns include the potential alteration of single-family communities and increased competition with developers. Despite initial resistance, the bill gained momentum after amendments were added to include union hiring for certain projects.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) provides a crucial remedy for the current fragmentation and ailments of the global multilateral system. It contends that traditional institutions like the UN are increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, with the Global South marginalized. The SCO is presented as an embodiment of cooperative principles, offering a platform for diverse states to collaborate and uphold international law. The author suggests it is a necessary alternative in a world where tariffs and sanctions often replace negotiation.</p>
