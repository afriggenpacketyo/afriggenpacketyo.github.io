          <h2>'28 Years Later' Review: A Divisive but Ambitious Zombie Reboot</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of ‚Äú28 Years Later,‚Äù the latest zombie film from Alex Garland and Danny Boyle, highlights its unusual ambition and quirky characters despite a dull central plot. The film blends philosophy, violence, pathos, and comedy, resulting in a tonally ungainly but kooky spectacle. The plot involves survivors nearly three decades into a viral pandemic, and the film's editing incorporates archival footage and abrasive sound to make points about human nature and struggle. The review concludes that the film doesn't reveal everything it's after but is an intriguing comment on human progress, and the author's tone throughout the article reflects the seriousness of the situation and its potential implications for community relations, with the author not making any direct reference to the optimism score.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Science indicates that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced shoreline litter. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that regulations decreased plastic bag litter by 25% to 47% over six years. Fees on plastic bags were found to be more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, and the study highlights the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution.
