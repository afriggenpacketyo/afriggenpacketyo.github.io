          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is exploring the possibility of establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. Advocates believe ketamine can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, while clinicians emphasize the need for controlled administration and careful patient selection.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to result in most members committing to a significant increase in defense spending, fulfilling a major demand of U.S. President Donald Trump. Secretary-General Mark Rutte's efforts have made this goal acceptable to almost all NATO countries, particularly after Germany's support. While this is seen as a win for Trump, it also aims to rebalance the alliance and deter Russia. However, some European countries express concerns about social cuts and a lack of focus on Ukraine.</p>
