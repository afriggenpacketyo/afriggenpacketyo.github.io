          <p>UK saltmarshes are vital "sinks" that store climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud, according to a WWF report. These muddy, tidal habitats should be added to the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. WWF, working with the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, installed monitoring stations on Hesketh Out Marsh to analyze gas flows. The findings show that saltmarshes capture carbon in the soil, making them as important as trees for climate mitigation. </p>

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in return for the easing of tariff measures. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. Nakatani's remarks follow a suggestion from Japan's chief tariff negotiator that defense equipment purchases could help reduce the trade deficit. Nakatani is scheduled to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to discuss security issues. </p>
