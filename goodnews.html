          <p>The European Union is pursuing a new strategic agenda with India, aiming to strengthen trade and defense cooperation to draw New Delhi away from Russia's sphere of influence. This approach contrasts with the US, which has imposed tariffs on India for purchasing Russian fuel. The EU's strategy emphasizes India's role as a reliable partner, a counterweight to China, and a key player in diversifying global supply chains. The partnership also focuses on defense industrial cooperation, as India, the world's largest arms importer, seeks to modernize its military and reduce its dependency on Russian weaponry.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to a potential safety hazard. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is in motion. These detached parts could create a road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. The issue is reportedly related to a vehicle assembly problem rather than a defective part, and dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free. No accidents or injuries have been reported.</p>

The three-day visit includes a formal welcome with a carriage procession, a royal salute, and a state banquet. On Thursday, the president is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss a potential UK-US trade deal. The visit, which is unusual for a second-term US president, is accompanied by significant pageantry and security, and has been described by the Prime Minister's office as a "truly historic" and "unprecedented" event.</p>

The company's long-awaited Initial Public Offering (IPO) raised $800 million after being priced at $23.50 per share. The debut comes after previous delays due to market volatility and follows a recent trend of tech companies going public. StubHub has benefited from the post-pandemic resurgence of live events, such as major concert tours and sporting events, which have significantly boosted ticket sales and revenue in the secondary market.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Speculate Gold Prices Could Approach $4,000 Per Ounce Amid Market Volatility</h2>

          <p>The price of gold has surged nearly 80% since the beginning of 2024, recently surpassing $3,600 per ounce and prompting speculation that it could soon exceed the $4,000 mark. According to the article, several factors could contribute to this continued rise, including anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which can make gold a more attractive investment. Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are driving investors toward safe-haven assets like gold, further boosting its value. The article suggests these dynamics may fuel further price increases in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior performance in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus. The highest dose of orforglipron reduced blood sugar levels by 2.2% and led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, significantly more than the results from Rybelsus. This head-to-head study positions Eli Lilly's drug as a potentially more effective needle-free option in the lucrative GLP-1 market. The company expects to apply for approval to treat Type 2 diabetes in 2026, intensifying competition in oral obesity and diabetes treatments.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will remain over open water for several days and does not currently pose a direct threat to land. However, the system is expected to intensify, potentially reaching hurricane strength by the weekend as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its path remains uncertain, forecasters suggest it could approach Bermuda by next week as it continues to strengthen, with potential maximum winds of 85 mph.</p>

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that the decision was made after weighing the pros and cons, ultimately concluding it was important for the league to be on a major global platform. The return was driven by a strong desire from players to compete for their home countries in a best-on-best tournament.

          <p>The IRS is projected to adjust federal income tax brackets for 2026 to account for inflation, a move that could result in lower taxes for many American households. Analysts predict an inflation adjustment of around 2.7%, which would raise the income thresholds for each tax bracket, preventing "bracket creep" where cost-of-living pay increases push workers into higher tax rates. This annual change, along with adjustments to the standard deduction, ensures that tax policies keep pace with inflation. The adjustments for 2026 will also incorporate changes from recent tax legislation, including a more generous inflation bump for the bottom two tax brackets.</p>

          <p>Scotland is set to eliminate its unique "not proven" verdict as part of a major justice reform bill approved by the Scottish Parliament. The verdict, which has the same legal effect as "not guilty," has been criticized for being confusing and failing to provide closure for victims. The reforms will also increase the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds, a change intended to safeguard against wrongful convictions. Additionally, the bill establishes a specialized court for sexual offenses and creates a new victims and witnesses commissioner to ensure standards of care.</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen to 6.13%, their lowest level in three years, sparking a surge in both new loan and refinancing applications. This sharp decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an impending interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has caused yields on 10-year Treasury notes to drop. For potential homebuyers and existing homeowners with higher-rate loans, this creates a significant opportunity to secure more affordable financing. The article advises borrowers to act promptly by comparing lenders, checking their credit, and getting preapproved to capitalize on the favorable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The platform integrates with tools like GitHub and uses AI models from OpenAI and Google to analyze code and answer questions. Beykpour aims to solve the problem of opaqueness in the software development process, which he experienced firsthand as a product leader at Twitter.</p>
