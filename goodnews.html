          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though not without challenges. The club has seen on-field success, including winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, driven by manager Eddie Howe and new player acquisitions. Off the field, revenues are projected to soar, and major investments have been made in facilities, the academy, and the women's team. However, the club's growth is constrained by financial regulations, and the ownership continues to face scrutiny from human rights organizations like Amnesty International over sportswashing concerns related to Saudi Arabia's record.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a new digital-focused public diplomacy strategy in Africa, targeting Gen Z and Millennial audiences to enhance its soft power. The Chinese embassy in Kenya is sponsoring popular local social media influencers for tours of China, where they create content showcasing the country's culture, scenery, and cuisine for their large followings. This approach marks a shift from traditional state-led media campaigns to a more direct and relatable method of engaging with younger Africans. Observers note this is a significant step to refine China's image and build people-to-people ties by presenting a side of the country rarely seen in conventional news.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Music icon Lionel Richie has revealed in his new memoir, "Truly," that he was seriously considering becoming an Episcopal priest before his career in music took off. The famously shy artist was training for the priesthood during college when a pivotal moment occurred while performing with his band, The Commodores. An enthusiastic woman in the audience shouted, "Sing it, baby!," which he described as a profound acknowledgment that changed his perspective and life's direction. Shortly after, he contacted the church to inform them he would not be pursuing the priesthood, realizing his true calling was to write songs, which he considers his "real sermons."</p>

          <p>The German government has approved a "Modernization Agenda" aimed at integrating artificial intelligence across public administration to enhance efficiency and reduce bureaucracy. Key projects include using AI to streamline export regulations for businesses and expedite visa application processing. This push follows a broader "High-Tech Agenda" that identifies AI as a critical technology for Germany's future growth. However, the initiative has sparked debate among experts and academics, who raise concerns about over-reliance on US tech companies, data sovereignty, and the need for robust ethical oversight, particularly in sensitive areas like the judicial and immigration systems.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump nominee, ruled that the administration failed to meet the high legal standard required to deploy troops without the governor's consent, stating the protests were not disruptive enough to justify such an action. The decision emphasized the constitutional line between civil and military authority, with the judge writing that the nation is governed by law, not martial law. Oregon officials praised the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty and a check on executive overreach.</p>

While largely in agreement on policy, candidates like former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon sought to differentiate themselves based on their experience and generational perspectives.

          <p>A Birmingham woman named Liv Heeney, who at 28 discovered she carries a faulty gene that will likely cause early-onset frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is taking proactive steps for her future. This rare, hereditary form of the disease has affected 13 members of her family, including her mother, who passed away at 54. Faced with the high probability of developing the condition in her 40s, Liv has decided to use her knowledge to ensure any children she has are born free of the gene.
