          <p>After a 16-year hiatus, the iconic British band Oasis has launched their reunion tour, "Live '25," with a performance at Cardiff's Principality Stadium. The tour's announcement sparked immense global interest, selling around 900,000 tickets despite controversy over Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing, which led to an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. The band, featuring brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher alongside other former members, is performing a setlist of their classic hits but has no plans for new music. This tour is being described by their management as their "last time around," marking a significant, albeit final, chapter for their fans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's extensive tax and spending package in a 218-214 vote, sending the legislation to his desk. The passage followed days of intense negotiations, with President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson personally intervening to persuade Republican holdouts to support the bill. The legislation, a cornerstone of Trump's domestic agenda, was finalized just ahead of his self-imposed July Fourth deadline. To celebrate the bill's signing, the White House has planned a flyover of B-2 bombers, which Trump stated will coincide with the official signing ceremony.</p>

          <p>Meta's newly formed advanced AI lab, tasked with developing "personal superintelligence," has hired a notable number of researchers from China. Of the eleven publicly listed team members, seven are graduates of top-tier Chinese universities like Tsinghua and Peking University, who later continued their careers in the United States. This recruitment strategy has drawn attention both in China and within the competitive U.S. tech industry. The move comes amid heightened tensions with rivals like OpenAI, whose CEO has accused Meta of using aggressive tactics, including large signing bonuses, to poach talent.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations for the upcoming Brics summit, which will host leaders from 28 countries. The plan involves approximately 20,000 military personnel to ensure the safety of attendees. Security measures are extensive, including a strictly controlled no-fly zone over the summit venue, patrolled by armed fighter jets with the authority to shoot down unauthorized aircraft. The city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial flights, rerouting traffic to the international terminal, a level of security not seen since the 2016 Olympics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations comes the challenge of managing dogs' fear of loud fireworks. Experts from Canine Companions advise against taking pets to fireworks displays due to their sensitive hearing. To help dogs cope, it is recommended to exercise them earlier in the day to tire them out both physically and mentally. For dogs known to be anxious, creating a safe, secure space at home, closing windows, and using white noise or calming music can help muffle the sounds. Providing engaging toys like a frozen Kong can also serve as a welcome distraction during the noisy festivities.</p>

          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has proposed a major financial intervention to stabilize China's economy, suggesting the issuance of 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds. This move would be used to swap the hidden debts of local governments, which are seen as a significant systemic risk. Researchers at Tsinghua University's ACCEPT argue that this comprehensive package, potentially combined with funds to support the property market, is necessary to resolve the interconnected debt and real estate crises. The proposal highlights underlying concerns that despite signs of stabilization, high local government debt continues to disrupt the nation's economic and financial operations.

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new interstellar comet, officially named 3I/ATLAS, which is the third known object from another star system to visit our solar system. The comet was spotted using a telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles from Earth, posing no threat. Traveling at 37 miles per second, it is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers are now closely monitoring the object to determine its size and composition, with preliminary observations suggesting it may be several miles across and larger than the previous two interstellar visitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article outlines a strategy to improve insurance coverage for popular anti-obesity drugs like GLP-1s, which are currently unaffordable for most Americans. The author suggests a simplified pricing model where drug manufacturers charge employer-sponsored health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month, eliminating complex rebates. Employers could then cover a portion of this cost, bringing the employee's out-of-pocket expense down to a more manageable level, similar to prices in other countries. This approach would increase access to clinically important medications and could be a transformative step for public health in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key provision in the newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" introduces a temporary tax exemption on tips for many U.S. workers. The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income, a policy championed by President Trump during his campaign. However, this benefit is not permanent and is set to expire at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. The exemption is also phased out for individuals earning over $150,000 a year to prevent high earners from exploiting the system. While fulfilling a political promise, Democrats universally opposed the package, citing its deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the philosophical underpinnings of the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence are often misunderstood as purely individualistic. The author posits that the declaration is rooted more in a desire to restore the colonists' inherited rights as Englishmen and in the overarching biblical tradition of Western civilization. The famous line "all men are created equal" is presented not as a self-evident rationalist claim, but as a truth derived from the biblical concept of man being created in God's image. This perspective reframes the founding as an act of preserving and improving a political and moral inheritance, rather than a radical break from collectivism.</p>

          <p>The comprehensive domestic policy bill recently passed by Congress includes a new, temporary tax break specifically for senior citizens. The provision adds an extra $6,000 to the standard deduction for individual tax filers aged 65 and older ($12,000 for couples), effective from 2025 through 2028. This benefit is phased out for higher earners, starting at incomes over $75,000 for individuals. While presented as a benefit for seniors, analysts note that it primarily helps upper-middle-class retirees and does not fulfill the campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, as it is an income tax deduction, not a payroll tax cut.
