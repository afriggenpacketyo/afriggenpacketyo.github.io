          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled their original trials were unfair, a significant vindication for the traders who maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for what were considered normal practices at the time. Hayes, who served five and a half years in prison, described the conviction as having destroyed his family. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines recently completed a 1.25-mile swim from Alcatraz Island to the San Francisco shore while 31 weeks pregnant, an event that drew criticism on social media. Gaines, who undertook the swim with U.S. Navy SEALs after receiving clearance from her doctor, addressed the backlash on her podcast. She dismissed the negative comments, many of which accused her of endangering her unborn child, as uninformed and stated that regular exercise has contributed to her feeling well throughout her pregnancy.</p>

          <p>The recent trade deal between the United States and Japan, which lowers tariffs on Japanese vehicles, is signaling a significant shift in global trade dynamics and increasing pressure on other major Asian exporters. Analysts suggest that key allies will no longer receive a "free pass" and will need to negotiate actively to avoid being disadvantaged by the new terms set with Japan. This development is expected to prompt a restructuring of trade relations and supply chains as other nations race to secure their own favorable agreements with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McDonald's has seen a significant boost in customer traffic following the reintroduction of its popular Snack Wraps after a nearly decade-long absence. Initial data indicates a double-digit jump in daily traffic during the launch, with some analysts estimating a 7% rise in U.S. same-store sales for the quarter. The high demand even led to temporary lettuce shortages at some locations. An early survey shows strong customer satisfaction, with 90% of buyers stating they would purchase the item again, suggesting sustained positive sales impact for the company.</p>

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features for its teen users on Instagram, including enhanced direct messaging protections to combat exploitative content and potential scams. The update follows increased pressure from policymakers and the removal of nearly 135,000 accounts for sexualizing children, which led to the takedown of an additional 500,000 linked profiles. The company is now automatically placing teen accounts into its strictest settings to filter offensive content and limit contact from unknown users, as Congress considers new child safety legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges that he condoned a criminal offense. The charges stemmed from satirical social media posts he made following the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump, where he joked about fascists dying. The judge ruled the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and did not intend to disturb public order or incite crime. Prosecutors had argued the statements were a form of hate crime and sought a €6,000 fine.</p>

          <p>George Finch, a 19-year-old from the Reform UK party, has become the youngest council leader in the United Kingdom, taking charge of the £2bn Warwickshire County Council. Finch, who still lives at home and had planned to become a history teacher, has dismissed criticism about his age and lack of experience as irrelevant. Since taking the role, he has already used his influence to address a local school controversy over a union jack dress. His appointment highlights Reform UK's growing momentum, which Finch attributes to the party offering hope to young people.</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied history. Originally launched as the 24-gun Royal Navy frigate HMS Hind in 1749, it participated in the American War of Independence. After its military service, the ship was sold and repurposed for whaling in the Arctic before wrecking in a storm off Sanday in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving. The identification was made possible through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a significant community effort to recover the timbers.</p>

          <p>Shares of major German carmakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz surged following the announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and Japan that significantly lowers auto tariffs.

Germany's auto industry association urged the EU to intensify its negotiation efforts, emphasizing that a solution is now more crucial than ever. The U.S. is a critical export market for the EU's automotive sector, which has been vulnerable to trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized from 281 exits, mostly through smaller-value acquisitions rather than large IPOs. This trend suggests that while investor appetite for AI is robust, the path to liquidity is currently dominated by bolt-on deals where larger companies acquire smaller startups to enhance their own offerings.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill that could allow more individuals to access high-risk investments typically reserved for the wealthy. The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would direct the SEC to create a test to qualify individuals as "accredited investors," regardless of their income or net worth. Currently, this status is primarily determined by financial thresholds, but the bill's sponsor argues that financial knowledge is a better measure of a person's ability to weigh investment risks. The legislation must still pass the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>
