          <p>The 81st anniversary of D-Day was commemorated at the American cemetery in Normandy, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasizing the importance of alliances in both past and present times. Hegseth noted that "America first" does not mean "America alone," highlighting the need for collaboration with allies to address global threats. World War II veterans, including 102-year-old Jake Larson, shared their experiences and reflections on the sacrifices made during the war. Despite the crowds honoring the event, some veterans expressed concern that the lessons of the war have not been fully learned, underscoring the ongoing need for remembrance and understanding.</p>
