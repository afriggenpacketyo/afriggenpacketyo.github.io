        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms, marking the first time since March, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries reported the average price dropped to 3,920 yen per 5 kg during the week ending June 15. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributed the price decrease to the government's release of additional rice reserves. Measures have been implemented to prohibit reselling rice bought at retail stores at higher prices. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to streamline and reduce prior authorizations. The changes aim to speed up patient access to care and reduce the administrative burden on providers. Prior authorization, which requires providers to obtain approval from insurance companies before certain treatments, has been criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. The changes will be implemented across various markets and are expected to benefit 257 million Americans. </p>

          <p>Despite potential distractions from President Trump's administration, China seeks to build on eased trade tensions with the U.S. following recent talks in London. Observers suggest Beijing should temper expectations of a complete restoration of senior-level exchanges but advance a leader-driven process to stabilize bilateral ties. The framework reached in London is seen as a temporary truce, positioning China favorably in negotiations with major trading partners. Sourabh Gupta of the Institute for China-America Studies noted that the framework represents a genuine de-escalation of trade tensions. </p>
