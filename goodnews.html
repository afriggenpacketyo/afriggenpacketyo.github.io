          <p>This article discusses the challenges Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces as he navigates the complexities of full employment and low inflation. Economists are divided on whether Powell's current strategy of inaction is the right approach, considering potential threats to both growth and inflation from President Trump's policies, including tariffs. Some experts believe the Fed is already behind the curve, potentially leading to a recession if they wait for labor market confirmation before cutting rates. The article highlights the historical context of Fed leaders being criticized for acting too slowly and the risks associated with waiting for more clarity amidst volatile economic conditions.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire deal following U.S.-led mediation talks aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations. President Trump announced the agreement, which comes after weeks of clashes triggered by a gun massacre on tourists that India blames on Pakistan. The ceasefire includes a cessation of all firing and military action from land, air, and sea, following a significant escalation involving drone and missile strikes by both sides. Secretary of State Rubio commended both Prime Ministers for choosing the path of peace and initiating talks on broader issues.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Maine Lobster Now has ranked New Hampshire as the top destination for pizza lovers in America, surpassing New York and Chicago. The study analyzed factors such as the number of pizzerias per capita, interest in pizza based on Google searches, and the average price of pizza in each state. New Hampshire boasts the highest number of pizzerias per 100,000 residents and a relatively affordable average pizza price, while New York ranked surprisingly low due to its high prices and lower pizzeria density.</p>

          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born businessman and founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, has died peacefully at the age of 84. Farmer first opened a tyre business in 1964 and later established Kwik Fit in 1971, growing it into the world's largest independent tyre and automotive chain with over 2,000 locations in 18 countries before selling it to Ford for ¬£1 billion in 1999. He was also known for his majority stake in Hibernian FC for 28 years and was knighted in 1997 for his contributions to the automotive industry and charitable work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and rapidly falling rates of family formation represent a looming demographic crisis that progressives should address rather than dismiss. The author contends that an aging and shrinking population will lead to a decrease in the expected quality of life due to a smaller working population supporting a larger elderly population. Ignoring the issue due to political polarization risks ceding control of the conversation to those with distasteful politics, and the author suggests that policies supporting families, such as affordable housing and universal pre-K, could align with progressive priorities and help stabilize the population.</p>

          <p>This article examines the claim that Germany's domestic intelligence agency has "withdrawn" its classification of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The agency has complied with the AfD's request to follow a "standstill commitment," putting the official reclassification on hold pending a lawsuit. The classification "confirmed right-wing extremist" was not withdrawn and the court could have issued an injunction. Experts emphasize that this is standard administrative procedure and does not indicate a change in the agency's assessment of the AfD.</p>

While the return of the spacecraft highlights past achievements, it also underscores the current limited exploration of Venus compared to other planets like Mars, with only a lonely Japanese space probe currently orbiting Venus.</p>

The bill repeals sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of schedule I substances, and that require the ONDCP to oppose any attempts to legalize schedule I substances.</p>
