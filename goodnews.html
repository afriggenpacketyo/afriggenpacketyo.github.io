          <p>British television host Davina McCall, 57, is engaged to her partner of seven years, celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas. The announcement comes after a challenging year for McCall, who underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor and has since shared that scans show a successful removal. McCall, a prominent figure in UK media known for hosting shows like "Big Brother," met Douglas professionally in the early 2000s before they began their relationship in 2018. Her representative confirmed the positive personal news, which follows her public advocacy work related to menopause and health awareness.</p>

          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer CC Sabathia weighed in on a viral video showing an adult fan aggressively taking a home run ball from a father and his young son at a Philadelphia Phillies game. Sabathia called the incident "crazy" but praised the power of social media and the Phillies organization for their response. After the video circulated widely, the team located the family and provided the child, Lincoln Feltwell, with a package of souvenirs and a signed bat from outfielder Harrison Bader. The positive resolution turned a negative fan experience into a memorable one for the young boy.</p>

Initially given a low five-year survival rate, she has since participated in clinical trials and undergone various treatments that have kept the cancer, which spread to her brain, from growing. Kalver has become an advocate, launching a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing "living, not just surviving." Her story highlights both the harsh realities of treatment and the resilience required to live a full life with a chronic illness.</p>

          <p>Fast-food giants are losing morning customers to convenience stores, which have seen a 9% rise in breakfast traffic compared to a 1% increase for fast-food chains. According to market research, "food-forward" convenience stores like Wawa and Casey's are successfully attracting consumers with expanded food service options, variety, and perceived value. This trend marks a reversal of market share gains made by fast-food restaurants during the pandemic. Industry leaders like McDonald's have acknowledged breakfast as their weakest daypart, as budget-conscious consumers increasingly opt to eat at home or find alternatives.</p>

          <h2>Tokyo Hosts World Athletics Championships Amid Controversy Over Gender Testing</h2>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, marking a significant return of spectators to a major sporting event in the city after the fan-less 2020 Olympics. However, the event is shadowed by controversy surrounding the reimposition of mandatory genetic testing for female athletes. World Athletics has defended the policy as necessary to protect the integrity of women's sport, but critics argue the SRY gene test is an unreliable indicator of sex and represents an intrusion from ongoing "culture wars." The policy has been particularly contentious in countries like France, which bans such non-medical screening.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A humorous opinion piece critiques the cyclical nature of the fashion industry and expresses dismay at recent signs that skinny jeans may be making a comeback. The author argues that fashion media perpetually encourages unnecessary consumption by declaring old trends new again, forcing people to constantly update their wardrobes. The writer shares a personal disdain for denim in general, suggesting that trends should be ignored in favor of individual style and comfort, and humorously recounts the physical struggle of trying on the restrictive pants.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup OpenAI is driving a spending spree that is significantly benefiting major tech companies, with Oracle being the latest to see a historic stock surge. OpenAI's massive financial commitments for cloud computing power and custom processors have also been a key catalyst for Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom. While this spending has added trillions to the tech sector's market capitalization, some analysts express concern about the industry's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning private company. OpenAI is reportedly set to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years, starting in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Google Flights, the single most effective piece of advice for travelers looking to find cheap airfare is to be flexible with their travel dates. An analysis of flight data shows that flying midweek—on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is typically 13% less expensive than traveling on weekends. The company also debunks the common myth that booking a flight on a specific day of the week, such as Tuesday, results in significant savings. Experts suggest that even shifting travel plans by a day or two can make a substantial difference in ticket prices.</p>

          <p>Americans seeking the latest COVID-19 vaccine may face challenges due to a significant policy shift by the FDA, which has narrowed its approval to specific high-risk groups and those 65 or older. This change means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies, though some may be able to "self-attest" to having a risk factor. The article provides a guide to the qualifying conditions, the status of vaccine availability for different age groups, and the current uncertainty around insurance coverage pending forthcoming CDC recommendations. This marks a departure from previous years when the vaccine was available to nearly everyone.</p>

          <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the department's Climate Working Group, a panel of scientists known for questioning the consensus on climate change. The group authored a report that was widely criticized by the scientific community as being error-filled and misrepresenting climate science. The decision to dissolve the group comes as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists pursue a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the panel was created unlawfully in secret to support an agenda of deregulation. The controversial report has been cited by the EPA in proposals to roll back climate pollution rules.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, delves into the complex cultural and architectural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete housing blocks that defined much of the urban landscape of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of social decay and extremism in the turbulent years following German reunification. The exhibition uses art to explore the collective memory and societal changes associated with these divisive yet iconic structures, where a large portion of the East German population once lived.</p>
