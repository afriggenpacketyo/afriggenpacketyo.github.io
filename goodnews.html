        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban after a federal appeals court ruling limited the policy. The court found that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This decision effectively lifts a sweeping measure that had closed the asylum system to those entering illegally. Consequently, officials will resume processing migrants under standard immigration law, which allows them to apply for humanitarian refuge, though most will likely remain detained during the process.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crew conducted a dramatic rescue of two hikers who became stranded on a remote beach at Point Reyes National Seashore after rising tides cut off their exit. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office reported that the pair called for help after realizing they were trapped near Elephant Rock. Due to the lack of safe access by land or sea, responders used a 100-foot line to hoist the hikers from the shore. The National Park Service warns that the area is hazardous due to powerful surf, strong currents, and unstable cliffs, advising visitors to check tide charts.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a defense deal valued at $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, strengthening their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific. The deal is part of Australia's broader military restructuring aimed at enhancing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. This marks Japan's first export of warships since before World War II, with the first three frigates to be built offshore and the remainder in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from 45 California counties over allegations of improper hazardous waste disposal. The lawsuit claimed that the shipping giant irresponsibly discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative and had already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes $1.4 million in civil penalties and funds for environmental projects and cost reimbursement.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are advising Californians that tarantula sightings will be more common from August through December as it is the spiders' mating season. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, sometimes traveling up to 20 miles. The most common species in Southern California are the Mojave blonde and California ebony tarantulas, often spotted at dusk in chaparral, deserts, and mountain areas. Officials say the spiders are generally harmless unless provoked and advise the public to observe them from a distance, as they play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Donald Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump called the ad the 'hottest' out there and encouraged his followers to buy the jeans, leading to a rally in the company's stock. The endorsement came amid a social media controversy where some critics accused the ad's wordplay on 'genes' and 'jeans' of promoting eugenics. The stock surge provided a boost to the retailer, which has recently faced financial difficulties and slow sales.</p>

Among the unclaimed funds are 11 prizes of £100,000 each. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its process for tracing account holders, which can be difficult for those who were gifted bonds or only have paper records. NS&I stated that it has successfully paid over 99% of prize-winners since the draws began in 1957 and offers a tracing service to help locate mislaid accounts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for that age group. Two studies published in JAMA found that screening rates for people aged 45-49 rose 62% from 2019 to 2023. This uptick in screening is linked to a 12% annual jump in the detection of colorectal cancer from 2019 to 2022, primarily in its earlier, more treatable stages. While the findings are promising, researchers note that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was primarily driven by the impressive earnings reports from major technology companies. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over new tariffs, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw significant gains. Cramer argued that the market's resilience is rooted in the success of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, whose strong performance in cloud computing, search, and retail has bolstered investor confidence. These cash-rich companies with multiple revenue streams are seen as a stabilizing force in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, police must conduct more thorough background checks, including speaking with partners and household members to identify signs of domestic abuse or other risk factors.
