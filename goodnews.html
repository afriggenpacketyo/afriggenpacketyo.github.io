          <p>Caught between the US-China trade war, Asean has the chance to assert itself as a linchpin in global trade and geopolitics by fostering a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem. China and Asean recently finalized negotiations to upgrade their free-trade agreement, aiming to deepen economic integration through digital trade and green economy initiatives, with bilateral trade exceeding $980 billion last year. Simultaneously, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim seeks a unified response to US tariffs to ensure trade fairness for Asean's export-driven economies. Asean's geographical centrality and diplomatic neutrality positions it to shape trade rules and prioritize regional resilience, requiring unprecedented cohesion amidst internal divisions and external pressures. The article argues that Asean can redefine its role by leveraging the US-China rivalry to become the architect of a new regional order.</p>

          <p>A history buff using a metal detector led archaeologists to the site of a lost medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, after spotting a strange symbol on an 18th-century map. The location, marked as "Klosterkullen" (monastery hill) on a 1760 map, was investigated using ground-penetrating radar, revealing the walls of probable monastery ruins. Archaeologists believe the walls are remains of pillar foundations dating back to the late 1100s, potentially the original site of √Ös Abbey, a large monastery managed by the Cistercian religious order.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe experience greater meaning in life compared to those without children, but they also report lower levels of life satisfaction, especially mothers. The degree of life satisfaction is strongly influenced by the family policies in place in their respective countries. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare and parental support systems, show smaller differences in satisfaction between parents and childfree individuals. The study suggests that societies that view children as a shared responsibility, rather than solely the parents', contribute to higher parental satisfaction.</p>

          <h2>Japan Welcomes New Olympic Age Limit for Skateboarding</h2>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit of 14 and older for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. World Skate instituted the limit due to increasing injuries among younger children attempting difficult tricks. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa believes it's a good decision to protect physically immature athletes. While Japanese organizers will keep domestic competitions open to younger children, they will consider how to support children aiming for the Olympics.</p>

          <h2>Japan Prisons Shift Focus to Rehabilitation</h2>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to the Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons for the first time in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer categorized by labor requirements, and prison work is not mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance. The new system features 24 tailored programs based on inmates' age and characteristics, with reviews every six months to adjust treatment plans. The goal is to reduce recidivism by providing appropriate support and guidance.</p>
