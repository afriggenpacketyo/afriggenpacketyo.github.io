          <p>Beirut's historic Hamra district is experiencing a remarkable cultural resurgence, spearheaded by the reopening of the Lebanese National Theater, Le Colisee. This initiative, driven by actor Kassem Istanbouli and a network of volunteers, aims to revive the area's golden era of arts and defy Lebanon's profound political and economic divisions. Despite the nation's severe economic collapse, currency devaluation, and the devastating 2020 port explosion, Hamra residents demonstrate extraordinary perseverance. The theater even served as an emergency shelter for those displaced by conflict, underscoring a community-led effort to preserve cultural identity and foster unity amidst ongoing national instability and humanitarian challenges.</p>

          <p>Many Americans reportedly suffer from magnesium deficiency, a condition linked to restless sleep, muscle cramps, anxiety, and fatigue. Health experts suggest that increasing magnesium intake, either through supplements or nutrient-rich foods, can significantly help alleviate these issues. A recommended "snack hack" involves consuming a pitted Medjool date with pumpkin seed butter before bedtime, as pumpkin seeds are a potent source of magnesium, along with fiber and protein. While magnesium isn't a "magic bullet" for all sleep problems, consistent intake, alongside healthy sleep habits, is believed to support melatonin production and enhance overall sleep quality.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties, encompassing major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and Chicago. This decision builds upon an earlier April ruling that found President Trump's directive to freeze funding for local governments that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be unconstitutional. The plaintiff cities argued that these policies represent an "abuse of power" and infringe upon the Tenth Amendment, asserting their autonomy in choosing not to assist ICE and fostering trust within their immigrant communities. The White House, however, contends that sanctuary cities impede federal immigration enforcement and compromise public safety.</p>

          <p>The war in Ukraine is significantly reshaping geopolitics, leading to a visible decline in Russia's influence across former Soviet states. This is exemplified by the US-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, a role previously dominated by Moscow. Nations like Azerbaijan are forging new alliances with countries like Turkey and Central Asian states, while others, such as Tajikistan, are openly challenging Russia's "superpower" image. The article suggests that Russia's preoccupation with Ukraine, combined with international sanctions, has created a "window of opportunity" for these states to pursue more independent foreign policies and engage with other global powers like China.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has successfully completed the signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace for a deal worth £60m, including add-ons, marking their seventh summer acquisition. This transfer is particularly significant as Eze was a primary target for north London rivals Tottenham, who had previously agreed terms with both the player and his club. However, Eze, a lifelong Arsenal fan who began his youth career there, ultimately chose to rejoin the Gunners. Both Sporting Director Andrea Berta and Manager Mikel Arteta lauded Eze as a "creative and explosive talent" possessing immense technical quality and a strong mentality, anticipating his substantial contribution to the team's offensive prowess.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent signal hinting at potential interest rate cuts significantly energized Wall Street, particularly benefiting cyclical and economically sensitive stocks such as DuPont and Home Depot. While a general sentiment exists that lower rates broadly support the market, major tech stocks experienced only modest gains, as their performance is currently more intrinsically linked to the artificial intelligence boom rather than borrowing costs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new all-time high, though the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite did not eclipse their prior milestones. This market dynamic highlights how anticipated monetary policy shifts can differentially influence various market segments, with investor focus extending beyond just rate expectations.

          <p>Berlin has officially renamed "Mohrenstrasse" to "Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse," concluding a protracted legal battle and honoring the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. The former name, "Moor" Street, held deeply offensive racist connotations, originating from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany. This significant change, initially approved in 2020 and consistently upheld by courts despite lawsuits from residents, coincides with the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. The renaming is a crucial step towards decolonizing public spaces, aiming to place Black history, achievement, and resilience at the forefront, and recognizing Amo as a historically overlooked trailblazer.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Shawn Kemp has received a sentence of 30 days of electronic home monitoring, one year of state Department of Corrections supervision, and 240 hours of community service, following a shooting incident in a Washington state mall parking lot. Despite prosecutors recommending a nine-month jail term, Pierce County Superior Court Judge Michael Schwartz opted for a lesser sentence, agreeing with Kemp's claim of self-defense after his truck, cellphone, and memorabilia were allegedly stolen. Kemp, a six-time NBA All-Star, expressed his intention to become an advocate against gun violence, especially among young people, reflecting on the challenges of his recent years.</p>
