          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has voiced his displeasure with the new NFL-approved helmets, which he must wear as his old model no longer meets league safety standards. He described his new helmet as looking like a "damn spaceship" and confirmed he is still in the process of finding a comfortable and suitable replacement before the season begins. This equipment issue arises as Rodgers enters what he has suggested will be his final season in the NFL, adding a minor but persistent frustration to his preparations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has officially ended a week-long "boil water" notice for approximately 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. The disruption was caused by a faulty, 57-year-old valve that became stuck and impeded water flow, a problem complicated by nearby utility lines. With service restored, the DWP is now advising residents to thoroughly flush their pipes and appliances and will issue a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged his country's use of "repressive violence" in Cameroon during its struggle for independence in the 1950s. The admission, made in a letter to Cameroon's president, follows a historical report detailing how French forces engaged in mass displacement and supported brutal militias, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. This move is part of a broader French effort to confront its colonial past, though it comes at a time of growing anti-French sentiment in former African colonies.</p>

The suspects are accused of targeting the residences of various actors and professional athletes. Authorities noted the increasing sophistication of such criminals, who sometimes use hidden surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi jammers to monitor their targets' routines and disable security systems before breaking in.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market surged on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite approaching record highs, after a new report showed inflation was slightly cooler than expected in July. The consumer price index rose 2.7% annually, below the 2.8% forecast, fueling investor optimism for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. This positive market reaction reflects hopes that easing inflation will give the Fed the justification it needs to lower borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July revealed a 2.7% annual inflation rate, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts. However, the report also showed that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased to 3.1% over the past year, its highest level in five months. Food prices continued to climb, with groceries up 2.2% annually, while gasoline prices provided some relief by falling, partially offsetting the inflationary pressures from other sectors of the economy.
