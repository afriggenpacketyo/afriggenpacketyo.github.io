          <p>R&B singer Kehlani's scheduled performance at Central Park's SummerStage for Pride festivities has been canceled following pressure from New York City officials, citing security concerns related to the singer's pro-Palestinian views. First Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro warned the City Parks Foundation that its license to stage the concert series could be at risk if the performance proceeded. This follows a similar cancellation at Cornell University, though city officials deny citing Kehlani's personal opinions as the reason. Kehlani, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in the Gaza conflict, appeared unfazed by the cancellation, stating they remain grounded in their purpose and are focused on their upcoming album release. The article also includes a statement from PEN America calling the cancellation cowardly.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation hurts public schools, while supporters say it provides parents with the freedom to choose the best educational option for their children.
