          <p>Sue Baker, a heart failure patient with a LVAD, underwent a pioneering heart-liver transplant to address her high antibody levels, which posed a risk of organ rejection. The liver transplant was intended to lower her antibody levels, making her eligible for a heart transplant. The surgery, a first for a patient with an LVAD, was successful, and Baker also donated her healthy liver to another patient in a domino operation. While the surgery has paved the way for similar treatments, Baker now faces financial difficulties due to medical bills and the sudden death of her husband.</p>
