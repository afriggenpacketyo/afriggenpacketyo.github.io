          <p>Following the recent ceasefire, U.S. Central Command leader Admiral Brad Cooper visited the Gaza Strip to discuss post-conflict stabilization, emphasizing that no American ground troops would be deployed. The visit comes as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are returning to their homes, many of which are destroyed. Under a U.S.-led peace plan, a multinational task force composed mainly of troops from Arab and Muslim nations is envisioned for Gaza, with an initial deployment of 200 U.S. troops to Israel to help enforce the ceasefire. This effort aims to synchronize activities supporting the region's recovery after over two years of conflict.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights a recent political rally for New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli in Wildwood, drawing parallels to the energetic, in-person events popularized by Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk. The event attracted approximately 800 attendees who expressed enthusiasm for live gatherings as a way to build community and political momentum. Key issues for voters included energy prices, taxes, and crime, but the overarching theme was a festive and hopeful call to action. The author suggests that the joyous and community-focused nature of such rallies presents a strong contrast to the perceived anger in Democratic gatherings, serving as a powerful organizing tool for the GOP.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held what was described as a very productive phone call, focusing on a potential path to peace for Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Trump to help broker an end to the war with Russia and discussed the need to bolster Ukraine's air defense following recent attacks on its energy infrastructure. The conversation signals a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a tense televised meeting earlier in the year. A White House official confirmed the call took place but did not provide further details on the discussions or any agreements reached.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson has confirmed that former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. His diagnosis of an aggressive, high-grade form of the disease was announced in May, with his office noting that the cancer's hormone-sensitive nature allows for effective management. The 82-year-old's health has been a topic of public interest, and this news follows a procedure he had in September to treat skin cancer. Prostate cancer is highly common among men in the U.S., but it generally has a very high five-year survival rate and is often treatable even when it has spread.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces have won their third WNBA championship in four seasons, completing a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury with a 97-86 victory. A'ja Wilson, who was named Finals MVP, led the charge with 31 points and nine rebounds, overcoming a tough shooting night by converting 17 of 19 free throws. The Aces showcased their offensive depth, with five players scoring in double figures and strong three-point shooting from Chelsea Gray and others. The team's dominant performance throughout the league's first best-of-seven finals solidified their status as a modern WNBA dynasty.</p>

          <p>A panel on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, highlighting President Donald Trump's pivotal role in brokering the deal.

          <p>The Plaid Cymru party in Wales has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if the party wins the next Senedd election. The policy aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by encouraging new educators to stay and work in Wales for at least five years. The incentives would focus on priority subjects like math and science, as well as Welsh-medium teaching, with the goal of matching similar programs in England by 2030. The party estimates the plan would cost £6-7 million, funded from money already designated for curriculum support.</p>
