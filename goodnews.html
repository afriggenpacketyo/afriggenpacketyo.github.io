          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a ¬£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, marking a significant private credit investment. The loan, reported by the Financial Times and confirmed by CNBC sources, will be an investment-grade debt financing package with an interest rate below 7%. The funds are believed to be earmarked for Hinkley Point C, a project facing delays and budget increases after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted funding. This deal highlights the growing role of private credit in funding large-scale infrastructure projects in Europe, as private markets capitalize on opportunities in energy, transport, and data centers.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, contingent on inflation remaining under control. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that policymakers should consider easing monetary policy to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market.

Waller's comments reflect a divergence of views within the Federal Open Market Committee, as some officials prefer to wait for more data on the impact of tariffs and broader economic growth.
