        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she might favor an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting if inflation remains contained. Bowman's remarks echoed similar sentiments from Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting the Fed is considering easing monetary policy. This comes as President Trump has pressured the Fed to lower rates to alleviate the national debt's financing costs. Bowman noted that the impact of tariffs on inflation may be delayed and smaller than initially expected, paving the way for potential rate adjustments to sustain a healthy labor market (not investment advice).</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 12:42:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how to prioritize paying off medical debt versus credit card debt, noting that while conventional wisdom favors paying off high-interest debt first, medical debt often operates under different rules. Credit card debt can damage credit scores faster due to monthly reporting and compounding interest, while medical debt typically has a grace period before being reported. Credit card companies are also more aggressive with collections, while medical providers may offer payment plans or financial assistance. Ultimately, the article advises a proactive approach to managing both types of debt to avoid serious financial consequences.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, signaling the beginning of a decade-long survey of the cosmos. As a survey telescope, Rubin will create an elaborate, four-dimensional map of the cosmos, cataloging 37 billion astronomical objects and revisiting them every three nights for ten years. The observatory's data pipeline connects it to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California, where images will be analyzed and distributed to astronomers worldwide, issuing approximately 10 million alerts each night. The observatory is also likened to a planetary insurance policy, detecting near-Earth objects, and some predict it could generate evidence pointing toward alien intelligence.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging that the online property website's new rule violates antitrust laws. Zillow's policy bans home listings from its platform if they appear on other services for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow. Compass argues that this "Zillow ban" leverages Zillow's market dominance to stifle competition and restrict consumer choice. Compass CEO Robert Reffkin stated that no company should have the power to ban agents or listings based on their business model, and that it's a matter of protecting consumer choice.</p>
