          <p>A convicted felon in Florida, wanted for attempted first-degree murder, has been arrested after being on the run for over two years. The dramatic capture occurred after the 27-year-old suspect, D’Architray L. Sapp, allegedly ran into an apartment to evade police and later knocked down a female officer while attempting to flee. The officer was not injured, and Sapp was apprehended after two officers successfully deployed their stun guns. He now faces new charges of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest, in addition to his outstanding warrants.</p>

          <p>Following a significant downward revision to U.S. jobs numbers that drew political criticism, labor experts are clarifying the process. According to former officials, revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are a normal and essential feature of its reporting. The agency issues preliminary figures to provide timely information and then updates them as more complete survey data from businesses and households becomes available. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was large, it is part of a standard procedure to improve accuracy over time.</p>

          <p>A recent production of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' at the Hollywood Bowl is earning praise, particularly for its lead performances by Cynthia Erivo as Jesus and Adam Lambert as Judas. The review describes the show as having a rock concert atmosphere that honors the musical's 1971 concept album roots. The direction by Sergio Trujillo was noted for its grand scale and focus on the intense emotional and musical interplay between the characters. The production is seen as part of a broader, successful renaissance of Andrew Lloyd Webber's classic works in contemporary theater.</p>

The company also raised its full-year financial outlook, causing its stock to rally in after-hours trading. Palantir's growth has been fueled by a surge in its U.S. commercial and government contracts, the latter of which jumped 53% to $426 million. CEO Alex Karp stated the company aims to continue its rapid revenue growth while becoming more efficient and reducing its overall headcount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced it will open its doors to more Brazilian coffee, a move that comes just days after the United States imposed a new tariff on the product.

The U.S. imported nearly a quarter of Brazil's total coffee exports in the first half of this year. The timing of China's decision creates a significant shift in global coffee trade dynamics, directly countering the U.S. trade measure and offering relief to Brazilian exporters.</p>

          <p>An appreciation of the late Tex-Mex music legend Flaco Jiménez, who passed away at 86, celebrates his profound cultural impact beyond his famous collaborations. The article focuses on his use of humor and pride to address the serious issue of illegal immigration, exemplified by his song “Un Mojado Sin Licencia” (A Wetback Without a License). This track, and others like it, transformed the painful experience of undocumented immigrants into a story of resilience and joy. His music served as a form of rollicking revolt against xenophobia, refusing to let hardship take away his community's spirit.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has died at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, a period during which she oversaw a move toward greater public transparency and was the first head to be publicly identified upon appointment. Widely seen as a trailblazer who broke barriers for women in intelligence, she was also credited as the inspiration for Dame Judi Dench's portrayal of M in the James Bond films. Her leadership is remembered for modernizing MI5 and demystifying its work.</p>
