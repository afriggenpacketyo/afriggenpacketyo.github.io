          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed a Texas law that requires pornography websites to verify the age of their users, typically through a government ID or face scan. The 6-3 decision rejected arguments from adult entertainment companies, who contended the law violated free speech rights by creating a burden for adult users and raising privacy concerns. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, asserted that states have the authority to implement such measures to prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit content. The ruling sets a significant precedent for more than a dozen other states that have enacted similar age-verification laws.</p>

Before achieving global fame for her own novels, Morrison championed a generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali. She fought to publish their uncompromising work for a mainstream audience without diluting their integrity, believing that stories written for a specific community could still achieve universal appeal. This work reveals her definition of a literary legacy: creating art so profound that it transcends its intended audience and endures for generations.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, a federal program that subsidizes internet and phone service for low-income households, schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers. The challenge was brought by conservative groups arguing that Congress improperly delegated its taxing power to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which administers the fund. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the majority, rejected this argument, ensuring the continuation of the program. The ruling is a significant affirmation of the FCC's authority and a key support for maintaining telecommunications access in underserved areas.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that his team is in discussions with current world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal reportedly contains exit clauses. The rumor surfaces amid a performance dip for Red Bull and a major F1 rule change set for 2026, which could shift the competitive landscape.
