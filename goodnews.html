          <p>A 19-year-old in Norfolk, England, has become the first patient in Europe to receive a newly licensed drug, leniolisib, for a life-threatening inherited immune disorder called APDS. The condition, which affects the body's ability to fight infections, had previously claimed the lives of several of her family members. The treatment was developed just 12 years after researchers in Cambridge identified the faulty gene responsible, partly through studying the patient's own family. The drug offers new hope and a chance at a normal life for those with the rare condition.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that the current stock market rally is broader than many critics suggest, pointing to a diverse group of top-performing S&P 500 stocks. He highlighted gains across various sectors, including solar energy, mining, cryptocurrency, data centers, and biotechnology, as evidence that the market's success is not narrowly confined to a few tech giants. Cramer suggested that those who bet against the market due to perceived narrowness are now facing losses as a wide range of companies demonstrates strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled through the armpit by a 6-foot beach umbrella pole. The incident occurred when a gust of wind caught the umbrella she was trying to secure, pulling her off the lifeguard stand and onto the pole. Remarkably, the pole missed all major arteries and nerves, and the lifeguard remained calm throughout the rescue, during which first responders used a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport. She is expected to make a full recovery and plans to return to her job.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing evidence of a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be about the mass of Saturn and orbits a young star relatively close to our solar system. Scientists used high-contrast imaging with a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly points to it being a new planetary discovery.</p>

He touted seven balanced budgets, multiple state credit upgrades, and progressive legislation on issues like the minimum wage and assault weapons ban. Pritzker positioned himself as a problem-solver in contrast to the Trump administration, while also calling out shortcomings in his own party. His announcement comes amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, though he declined to comment on future national ambitions.</p>

          <p>A large meteor streaked across the sky over metro Atlanta, creating a "fireball" effect before disintegrating and causing a loud boom that was heard and felt across several counties. NASA confirmed the event was caused by an asteroidal fragment, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, traveling at 30,000 miles per hour. The object broke apart about 27 miles above the ground, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT. Emergency officials are investigating reports that a piece of the meteorite may have struck a home.</p>

The provision would have allowed taxes on companies with foreign owners from countries deemed to have unfair tax policies, a measure critics warned would cost U.S. jobs and investment.
