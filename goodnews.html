          <p>Senate Republicans are considering revisions to President Trump's budget package, which narrowly passed the House, due to disagreements over Medicaid, spending cuts, clean energy tax credits, and the state and local tax deduction. Some senators are concerned about Medicaid cuts and the impact on rural hospitals, while others want deeper spending cuts. Disagreements also exist over rolling back clean energy tax credits, with some senators supporting a stable tax framework for domestic energy development. The inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling is also facing opposition from fiscal hawks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On "Fox & Friends," hosts Brian Kilmeade and Lawrence Jones engaged in a plank challenge, demonstrating the exercise's benefits. A fitness expert provided age-based targets for plank hold times, ranging from 20-30 seconds for those 60 and above, to 1-2 minutes for those in their 20s and 30s. Planks are touted as an abdominal exercise that strengthens muscles in the arms, legs, chest, and back, improving posture and flexibility. The article also mentions various plank versions, including high planks, modified planks, and side planks.</p>
