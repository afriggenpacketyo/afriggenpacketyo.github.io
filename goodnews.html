          <h2>Singapore's Economy Narrowly Avoids Recession with Growth in Manufacturing and Construction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:07:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction. Economists suggest this was partly due to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant global economic uncertainty and maintaining a downgraded GDP growth forecast for the full year.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts, largely due to strong shipments to regions outside the U.S. and a temporary tariff truce that slowed the decline in exports to America. Imports also saw their first yearly growth in 2025, rising 1.1%, although this was below expectations. The data revealed a surge in shipments to Southeast Asia and the European Union, while exports of steel and rare earths hit record highs. However, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, anticipating that the boost from front-loading exports may fade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value has soared to a new all-time high, exceeding $122,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is also fueled by anticipation of upcoming U.S. crypto legislation, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts believe the surge is propelled by long-term institutional buyers, with some predicting the cryptocurrency could reach $125,000 in the coming months. The potential new laws, supported by the Trump administration, are expected to boost investor confidence and further integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled for a second official state visit to the U.K. from September 17-19, an unprecedented honor for an American president. He and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. The invitation, delivered by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is viewed as a strategic effort to maintain strong diplomatic ties and mitigate the impact of U.S. trade policies. The visit may face protests, similar to his 2019 trip, and presents potential diplomatic complexities for King Charles, who is also head of state for Canada.</p>

However, Albanese also urged China to address its steel overcapacity, which is causing trade friction globally. The push for green steel is also a strategic move for Australia, as decarbonization could threaten its current market dominance if it doesn't adapt to new, cleaner production methods.</p>
