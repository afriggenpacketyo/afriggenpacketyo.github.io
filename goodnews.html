          <p>A senior official from China's top economic planning agency has indicated that Beijing may introduce stronger policies to support the country's private sector. In an article published in the People's Daily, the official acknowledged room for improvement in the business environment, calling for better property rights protection and more transparent law enforcement for enterprises. This signals a potential policy shift aimed at stabilizing market sentiment and boosting investor confidence after a period of regulatory tightening. The move could provide a needed lift to non-state firms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has uncovered and dismantled a massive, illicit telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area that posed a significant threat to the city's infrastructure and the U.N. General Assembly. The operation, the largest of its kind, seized 300 SIM servers with over 100,000 SIM cards capable of disabling cell towers and blocking emergency services. Investigators believe the well-funded network was used for encrypted communications between foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and other illicit groups. While no arrests have been made, the immediate threat has been neutralized.</p>

          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, has defended the government's proposed 2026 budget against criticism from opposition parties. He asserted that the government plans to invest €126.7 billion in critical areas like infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, using special funds to boost growth and secure jobs rather than finance "pet projects." Opposition parties have accused the ruling coalition of accumulating debt for tax breaks and pensions instead of making genuine investments. Klingbeil countered that the spending is necessary to rehabilitate sectors that have been neglected for years and to enhance Germany's competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his late-night show after being suspended by Disney-owned ABC for remarks about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which followed threats from the FCC chairman, ignited a nationwide debate over free speech, with many critics and celebrities decrying the move as censorship. Disney stated the show was suspended because the comments were "ill-timed and thus insensitive," but decided to reinstate it after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. However, Sinclair, a major ABC affiliate group, announced it would not air the show's return, replacing it with news programming.</p>

          <p>Technology consulting giant Accenture has proposed establishing a new campus in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, with plans to create approximately 12,000 new jobs. The company is seeking to leverage a state policy that offers land at a highly subsidized rate to large firms that commit to significant employment generation. This move reflects a broader trend of tech companies expanding into smaller Indian cities to benefit from lower operational costs and tap into local talent pools. If approved, the new campus would further solidify India's position as Accenture's largest global employee base.</p>

          <p>A loss of libido after childbirth is a common experience for many new parents, a topic recently highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth. Experts explain that this change can be attributed to a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustment to parenthood. The drop in estrogen levels can cause physical discomfort, while the pressures of caring for a newborn affect both mothers and fathers. Therapists emphasize the importance of open communication between partners to navigate this period without pressure, reassuring each other that the change is often temporary and not a reflection of the relationship itself.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) narrative, a recent UCLA survey indicates that a majority of Los Angeles residents support the construction of new apartment buildings, even in their own neighborhoods and on streets with single-family homes. The author argues that this widespread pro-housing sentiment, found in 14 of 15 City Council districts, provides a clear mandate for city leaders to pursue more aggressive housing policies. The piece criticizes Mayor Karen Bass for watering down an affordable housing directive, suggesting she is listening to a vocal minority rather than the data-backed silent majority. It calls for leaders to embrace this consensus to address the city's urgent housing crisis.</p>

          <p>An archaeological mission searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra has discovered evidence of a submerged ancient port connected to the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria, Egypt. Using advanced sonar technology, the Egyptian-Dominican team mapped a former shoreline and harbor that would have served the temple complex during the Ptolemaic period over 2,000 years ago. The lead archaeologist, Dr. Kathleen Martinez, believes this site, not the traditional location in Alexandria, is the true resting place of Cleopatra. The discovery of the port adds a new chapter to the history of the site and fuels the ongoing quest for the famous queen's tomb.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill requiring data centers to report their water consumption, a move driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and concerns about resource use in the arid state. If signed by the governor, the law will compel both new and existing facilities to disclose their projected and actual water usage annually. Data centers, which are proliferating across the western U.S., use vast amounts of water for cooling their servers. The legislation aims to provide localities with the necessary data to plan for sustainable growth and ensure that the thirsty industry does not over-strain community water supplies.</p>

Harris also voiced strong support for a controversial California redistricting measure championed by Newsom, framing it as a necessary "fight fire with fire" tactic against Republican efforts in other states.

          <p>The trend of giving children alternatively spelled names, such as "Oaklynn" or "Sadilynn," has sparked intense online debate and mockery, as seen in forums like the "tragedeigh" subreddit. The article explores the motivations behind this phenomenon, which include a desire for uniqueness, the influence of social media, and a way to feminize traditionally masculine names. Baby name experts suggest the backlash is often rooted in classism and a resistance to breaking from tradition. While these names are still relatively rare, the strong reactions they provoke highlight broader societal anxieties about identity, status, and the perceived "correctness" of cultural norms.</p>

          <p>A novel and environmentally friendly method of mining called "phytomining" is being developed, using hyperaccumulating plants that naturally absorb high concentrations of metals from the soil. In Albania, a startup is harvesting mustard plants to extract nickel, a metal in high demand for electric vehicle batteries. After the plants are harvested and incinerated, the resulting "bio-ore" is processed into nickel sulfate. Proponents say this method is a low-carbon alternative to conventional mining, which can be highly destructive and polluting, and it can be used on land unsuitable for traditional agriculture. While it cannot replace industrial mining, phytomining offers a supplementary, greener source for valuable metals.</p>
