Organizers urged festival-goers to take all their belongings to avoid the waste seen in previous years, although piles of rubbish and discarded items were still accumulating. The departure was marked by severe traffic delays and an amber heat health alert, prompting advice for travelers to stay hydrated. The festival will take a fallow year in 2026 and is scheduled to return in 2027.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing flu shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a significant step for the company, paving the way for regulatory filings for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to resubmit its application for the combination vaccine later this year, hoping for approvals in 2025. This development positions Moderna as a potential frontrunner in the race for combination respiratory vaccines.</p>

          <p>An article explores the work of Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, delving into how dogs experience the world primarily through their sense of smell. Horowitz argues that to understand dogs, humans must try to appreciate this olfactory perspective, which is fundamentally different from our visual-centric world. She explains that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are units of information that create a transient, ever-changing map of their environment. This difference in perception also shapes their experience of time, as the fading scent of a person can signify their absence.</p>

          <p>With its simple menu focused on chicken fingers, Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC to become the third-largest chicken chain in the U.S. by annual sales, behind only Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's growth has been rapid, expanding from 500 locations in 2020 to over 900 today, with system sales doubling since 2021 to reach $5.1 billion. The chain's success is attributed to its operational efficiency, a focus on company-owned restaurants rather than franchising, and a consistent, simple menu that avoids limited-time offers. Founder Todd Graves aims for the chain to become a top-10 restaurant brand.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that trade talks with the United States are resuming after his government rescinded a planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations and called the proposed tax a "blatant attack on our country." The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to revenue from Canadian users of companies like Google and Meta. In a statement, Canada said it was dropping the tax "in anticipation" of a new trade deal, a retreat some analysts see as a clear victory for the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of projects in Cuba suggests that China is quietly becoming the island nation's most important foreign partner, supplanting its historical ally, Russia. While many of Russia's recent promises for investment in areas like steel and sugar mills have not materialized, China has been pushing ahead with critical infrastructure projects. This includes financing and building dozens of solar parks across the country, which are vital for stabilizing Cuba's collapsed electrical grid. This shift in influence comes as Cuba faces a devastating economic crisis, making China's tangible support a crucial lifeline for the country's struggling economy.</p>

While Elon Musk's Neuralink is the most well-known, competitors like Precision Neuroscience, Blackrock Neurotech, and Synchron are also making significant progress, some with less invasive technology. These implanted devices work by detecting and decoding brain signals, allowing users to control computer cursors or generate artificial speech with their thoughts.

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has gone into effect, providing a preferential tariff rate for British cars imported into America. The first 100,000 vehicles annually will face a 10% tariff, a significant reduction that has been welcomed by the UK auto industry. However, questions remain over the final levies on British steel and aluminum exports, which are currently set at a 25% tariff. While the UK government aims for 0% tariffs on steel, negotiations are complicated by the U.S. "melt and pour" rule, which affects major producers like Tata Steel. (not investment advice)</p>
