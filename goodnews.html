          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to AAA, the national average was $3.165 per gallon on Monday, which is higher than when Trump took office. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this figure does not reflect the actual price paid by consumers at the pump, as it excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy emphasized that the RBOB price is irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, is continuing to defend US rules that ease access to the abortion drug mifepristone, a legal challenge that began during the Biden administration. In a filing in Texas federal court, the DOJ urged the judge to dismiss a lawsuit from Republican-led states on procedural grounds. Despite Trump's previous statements and actions against abortion rights, this move aligns with his administration's stance of not banning or restricting access to mifepristone, as stated by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>A law firm involved in the NCAA antitrust settlement criticized Nick Saban and rumors of a Trump administration executive order regarding name, image, and likeness (NIL) in college sports. The firm stated that Saban's involvement was "unmerited and unhelpful," arguing that college athletes are already benefiting from NIL deals without interference. Saban reportedly seeks to "reform" NIL, not halt it, while the firm believes executive orders are unnecessary, as NIL empowers athletes to earn their own income.</p>

          <p>Medicare does not cover dental care, routine vision exams, hearing aids, overseas medical care, or long-term custodial care, potentially leaving retirees exposed to significant out-of-pocket expenses. Supplemental insurance, such as Medigap, can help cover these gaps by paying for copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Purchasing Medigap coverage early is advisable, as healthcare costs are rising and eligibility can depend on health. Medicare recipients should consider supplemental coverage to protect their retirement finances.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S. by streamlining the approval process for domestic pharmaceutical plants. The order directs the FDA to reduce approval times, increase inspection fees for foreign plants, and improve enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting. This move comes ahead of planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, with the administration citing national security concerns and a desire to bring medical supply chains back home. Several pharmaceutical companies are starting to invest more in US based manufacturing.</p>
