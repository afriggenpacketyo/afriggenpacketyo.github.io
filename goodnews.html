          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who famously escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This monument will be the first to honor an individual African American at the location, a significant step in diversifying the historical figures represented there. The sculpture, created by artist Basil Watson, is the result of a bipartisan effort by state lawmakers to more fully represent the state's history. The statue will depict Smalls' journey, symbolizing his rise from slavery to a pioneering statesman.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a drop in share price following its second-quarter earnings report, some analysts view the dip as a buying opportunity for Amazon stock. The company exceeded revenue and earnings expectations, driven by strong performance in its high-margin advertising and cloud (AWS) divisions. While AWS revenue growth was slightly less than competitors and third-quarter operating income guidance was mixed, the core long-term investment thesis remains intact for these analysts. They emphasize that management has a history of conservative guidance and highlight the continued expansion of profit margins as a key positive indicator. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long desired. The estimated $200 million cost will be covered by private donations, including from the president himself, with construction slated to begin in September. This new addition will be built alongside the East Wing and is designed to host large formal functions, such as state dinners, eliminating the need for temporary tents. With a seating capacity of about 650, it significantly expands upon the East Room's capacity of 200, and is expected to be completed well before the end of the current presidential term.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has revealed that he was diagnosed with and battled a severe case of Lyme disease while on his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a social media post, the 44-year-old singer described the illness as "relentlessly debilitating," causing significant nerve pain and fatigue, but said he chose to continue performing to demonstrate his mental tenacity. The Mayo Clinic defines Lyme disease as a tick-borne illness causing symptoms like joint pain, fever, and muscle aches. Timberlake shared his struggle to be more transparent with fans and noted the future of his stage career remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>In an effort to make the British civil service more reflective of the country, the UK government has announced that its main internship scheme will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This determination will be based on the occupation of their parents when the student was 14. Successful interns will also be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for the civil service. The reform, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to harness a broader range of talent and ensure government decisions are better informed by diverse perspectives.</p>

          <p>In response to growing pressure from Wall Street, Apple CEO Tim Cook has indicated the company will significantly increase its investment in artificial intelligence and is open to acquisitions to accelerate its progress. During a recent earnings call, Cook stated that Apple is not limited by company size in its acquisition strategy, though recent purchases have been smaller. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than competitors like Google and Microsoft, Cook explained their hybrid model involves reallocating staff and using partners for infrastructure. He emphasized that AI is one of the most profound technologies and will be deeply integrated across all Apple platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet MLB trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by some National League rivals. The team addressed key needs by acquiring veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart from the Minnesota Twins and outfielder Alex Call from the Washington Nationals. The front office expressed confidence in their current roster, suggesting they believe internal improvements and returning injured players will be key to their late-season success. This conservative approach contrasts with last year's more aggressive deadline strategy and the major acquisitions made by competitors like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets.</p>

          <p>Cole’s French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. After announcing it would close, the restaurant experienced a dramatic surge in business, with long lines of customers wanting a final meal. The owner, Cedd Moses, struck a deal with the landlord to extend service while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy. While grateful for the recent boom, Moses noted the business challenges that led to the initial closure decision, including rising costs and a lack of sustained demand post-pandemic.</p>

The successful IPO is a welcome development for the tech industry and its investors, who have seen a prolonged drought in lucrative exits. It signals renewed Wall Street appetite for tech offerings after a multi-year slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, delivering its largest quarterly revenue growth since December 2021 with a 10% year-over-year increase. The strong performance was driven by a 13% rise in iPhone sales and a nearly 15% jump in Mac revenue, attributed to the popularity of new models. The company's services division also continued its steady growth, while iPad and wearables sales saw declines. Apple provided an optimistic outlook for the next quarter, projecting continued revenue growth even after accounting for potential costs related to trade tariffs.</p>
