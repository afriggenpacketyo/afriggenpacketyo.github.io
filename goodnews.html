          <p>Former President Barack Obama advised Democratic donors to "toughen up" and abandon the search for a political "messiah," urging them to support pragmatic candidates who can win elections. Speaking at a fundraiser, he called for less "whining" and more courage in defending core principles like free speech, even when it's uncomfortable. Obama emphasized the importance of backing viable candidates in upcoming gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, such as Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger. He also stressed that progressive ideals and practical solutions, like addressing housing shortages through zoning reform, are not mutually exclusive.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Victorville, California, arrested a man for allegedly filing a false emergency report and planting evidence as part of a prank. The incident involved a grotesque teddy bear, seemingly made of human skin, which was left at a gas station, prompting a police response. The San Bernardino County coroner quickly determined the bear was not made of human remains, and the creator, a South Carolina artist, confirmed it was one of her creations sold online. Officials highlighted that such hoaxes waste valuable emergency resources and can delay responses to genuine crises.</p>

          <p>An assault rifle and five magazines of ammunition that fell from a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department vehicle were safely recovered after a resident found them. The department had publicly disclosed the loss and detailed the deputies' route, appealing for public assistance in locating the weapon. A Lennox resident discovered the hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the South Los Angeles sheriff's station. Officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's integrity, which prevented a dangerous weapon from remaining on the streets.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new technique for rapidly cooling superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in advanced aircraft engines. This breakthrough could significantly enhance the performance, power, and durability of engines for next-generation fighter jets, an area where China has historically lagged behind Western nations. The turbine discs must withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, and improving their manufacturing process is key to advancing the country's military aviation capabilities. The development addresses an urgent need as China pursues the creation of at least two new sixth-generation fighter aircraft.</p>

          <p>Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) presents an interesting case for investors, focusing on alternative assets like infrastructure and renewable energy, which often perform differently from the broader stock market. The company manages money for institutional clients with long-term horizons, providing a stable base of fee-generating assets currently around $550 billion. Management aims to double these assets to $1.1 trillion by 2030, projecting an ability to increase its dividend by 15% annually. With a current dividend yield of 3.1%, the stock may appeal to both income-focused and growth-and-income investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to ever finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the "world's toughest foot race." The grueling 135-mile course starts below sea level in Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and ascends to an elevation of over 8,300 feet. Becker completed the race with three hours to spare, a redemptive finish after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. His achievement demonstrates remarkable endurance and serves as an inspiration, proving that age is not a barrier to extraordinary athletic feats.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is being auctioned by Sotheby's and is expected to sell for up to $4 million. The rare rock, named NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. This significant find provides a valuable dataset for scientists to study the red planet and unlock more of its secrets.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding destroyed their home and farmland in South Dakota, Dave and Judy Oberg are rebuilding on higher ground, a testament to the resilience of their community. The floods wiped out crops and infrastructure, forcing many like the Obergs to use their life savings for recovery without insurance or government aid. The region now faces what meteorologists call "whiplash weather," swinging from extreme rain to severe drought, posing new challenges for agriculture. Despite the lingering trauma and financial hardship, farmers are cautiously optimistic as this year's crops appear to be growing as expected.</p>

          <p>A report by brokerage firm Jefferies indicates that China is becoming a "biotech supermarket" for global pharmaceutical companies, who are increasingly looking to the country for innovative drug candidates. At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of presentations involved drugs from Chinese firms, a dramatic increase from a decade ago. The report notes that multinational corporations are attracted by China's cost efficiencies, accelerated development timelines, and promising quality. This trend involves deals where global firms acquire rights to develop and market Chinese-discovered compounds in international markets.</p>

          <p>A new Photo Booth Museum has opened in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, catering to a growing enthusiasm for the "analog magic" of old-school photography. Operated by San Francisco-based Photomatica, the venue features four restored vintage analog photo booths, some from the 1950s, alongside one modern digital booth. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the analog machines use original chemical processing, producing unique black-and-white photo strips. The museum aims to provide an interactive and nostalgic experience, tapping into the appeal that physical, spontaneous photography holds for digital natives.</p>
