          <h2>US and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement with Reduced Auto Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:14:34 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled a major trade agreement with Japan, proclaiming it as possibly the "largest Deal ever made" and a significant win for American jobs. The deal centers on a new reciprocal 15% tariff structure, which notably lowers the duty on Japanese auto imports from the previous 25%, a move confirmed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. For Japan, whose economy heavily relies on auto exports to the U.S., this development provided significant relief, sparking a major rally in automaker stocks on the Tokyo market. The agreement also reportedly includes a massive $550 billion Japanese investment into the United States and opens Japan's market to more American goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal's new £60m signing, Martin Zubimendi, is set to make his first public appearance for the club after a year-long transfer pursuit by manager Mikel Arteta. The Spanish international, a key player in Spain's Euro 2024 victory, revealed he turned down other offers last summer because he felt it wasn't the right time to leave Real Sociedad. Arteta expressed his excitement, confirming Zubimendi was signed specifically for the number six position to bring balance and impressive tactical intelligence to the midfield. Zubimendi stated that Arteta's meticulous coaching style was a major factor in his decision to join the London club.</p>

          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Remains at Four-Year Low Ahead of Monetary Policy Decision</h2>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at a low 0.8% in June, remaining at its lowest point in over four years and slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes volatile transport and accommodation costs, also remained unchanged at 0.6%. This persistent low inflation environment provides the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to support the nation's export-dependent economy. The MAS has expressed concerns about a subdued domestic growth outlook for the second half of the year, citing an uncertain global environment and the lagging impact of tariffs.</p>

          <h2>German Court Upholds 'Suspected Extremist' Classification for Far-Right AfD Party</h2>

          <p>Germany's top administrative court has rejected a final appeal from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, cementing its classification as a suspected right-wing extremist group. This final ruling allows the domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to continue monitoring the party, which can include using undercover informants. The court upheld a previous decision justifying the assessment based on evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the party, including views that degrade German citizens with migration backgrounds. A separate, more severe classification of the AfD as a "confirmed" extremist group is currently suspended pending another legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Laurent Mekies is taking the helm as Red Bull's new team principal, intending to adopt a "soft-touch" approach as he settles into the role following Christian Horner's departure. The 48-year-old Frenchman's primary task is to reverse the competitive decline the Formula 1 team has experienced over the past 18 months. Mekies, who has extensive F1 experience, says his initial focus will be on listening and understanding the team's dynamics to "discover the magic" that led to its past dominance. He aims to forge a new path for the team, which must now find success without the influence of both Horner and former design chief Adrian Newey.</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging UK retail environment, a chain of stores named Duck World, which sells only rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat and even expand. With four locations in prime London real estate, the stores cater to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers with a flock of over 700 different duck designs. Co-founder Irina Fedotova acknowledges pressures from inflation and rising costs but believes in the iconic appeal of the rubber duck, particularly among millennial consumers. Retail analysts suggest the business benefits from high-profit margins and the "treatonomics" trend, where consumers make small, mood-boosting purchases even during economic downturns.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations countries have to protect the climate from human-caused emissions. The ruling was requested by the U.N. General Assembly, following years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu that face existential threats from rising sea levels. While the court's opinion is non-binding, it is expected to establish a crucial legal benchmark that could form the basis for future international agreements and domestic climate lawsuits. The decision will address both the duties of nations to prevent climate harm and the legal consequences for failing to do so.</p>

          <p>International luxury and fashion brands are increasingly incorporating cafes and dining spaces into their retail stores across China to enhance customer experience and drive foot traffic. Major players like LVMH, Celine, and Giorgio Armani have recently opened branded coffee shops within their flagship stores in cities like Shanghai and Beijing. Analysts suggest this trend is a cost-effective marketing strategy for brands at a time of weak consumer spending in the country. The high-profit margins on beverages and the relatively low operating costs of a cafe make it an attractive way to build brand loyalty and encourage shoppers to spend more time in-store.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of a prehistoric battle between two apex predators from 13 million years ago. An analysis of teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a "terror bird," a large, flightless predator, suggests it was attacked and likely killed by a giant caiman, a crocodile-like reptile. Palaeontologists in Colombia used 3D scans to match the puncture marks to the extinct caiman species *Purussaurus neivensis*, which could grow up to five meters long. The fossil, found in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, provides rare insight into the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even the formidable terror birds were vulnerable to ambush from other powerful predators.</p>
