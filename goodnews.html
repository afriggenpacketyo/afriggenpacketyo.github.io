          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a $10,000 high-yield savings account in June 2025. While both options are FDIC-insured and offer security, CDs currently have slightly higher fixed interest rates for short-term periods (e.g., 4.49% for a 6-month CD). High-yield savings accounts offer variable rates, providing flexibility but potentially less guaranteed returns. The article suggests considering both options based on individual needs and financial goals, balancing the desire for higher returns with the need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
