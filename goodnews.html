          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 15:08:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses several methods for borrowers to reduce their credit card debt, given the current economic climate of elevated interest rates and lingering inflation. One option is balance transfer credit cards, which allow borrowers to move existing balances to cards with low or 0% introductory interest rates. Debt consolidation loans, with lower interest rates than credit cards, are another alternative. Debt management programs offer expert assistance and negotiation with credit card companies, while credit card debt forgiveness may be an option for those with significant debt and financial hardships.

Norrie, who had previously defeated Daniil Medvedev, struggled to capitalize on his opportunities, particularly in the second set. Djokovic is set to face Alexander Zverev in the next round, a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final where Zverev emerged victorious after Djokovic suffered a hamstring injury.</p>

          <p>Ukraine executed a complex drone attack, dubbed "Spider Web," targeting Russian air bases, including those housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The drones, numbering over 100, were smuggled into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries and launched remotely, striking locations as far as 8,000km from Ukraine. Ukraine claims to have hit 41 strategic bombers and destroyed at least 13, while Russia acknowledged damage only in Murmansk and Irkutsk. The operation, supervised by President Zelensky, took over a year to prepare and cost Russia an estimated $7 billion.</p>

          <p>The article suggests that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June 2025 could be a beneficial financial move for savers. With potential rate cuts looming in July and beyond, securing a CD now can lock in current interest rates. A long-term CD also provides protection against stock market volatility, as the interest rate remains fixed throughout the CD's term. Savers can earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, depending on the CD's term and interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>
