          <p>Energy bills for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to fall by 7% starting Tuesday, providing a modest monthly saving. The reduction comes from regulator Ofgem's latest price cap, though concerns persist about affordability during the upcoming winter. While analysts forecast a potential further small drop in October, they note that prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals for payment certainty and is also investing in energy infrastructure to create long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Consumer price inflation in the euro zone rose to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in months.

Democrats view the race as a key opportunity, especially if the controversial Paxton wins the GOP nomination.

          <p>A new report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission reveals a shift in American voting patterns during the 2024 election. While mail-in voting decreased to 30.3% of turnout from its 2020 pandemic peak of 43%, it remains more popular than in pre-pandemic elections. The most notable trend is the rise of early in-person voting, which, combined with Election Day voting, accounted for over two-thirds of all ballots cast. For the first time, every state offered some form of early in-person voting, indicating a growing preference for this convenient option.</p>

This aligns with a broader trend among Chinese tech firms to promote open-source development. Experts suggest this will incentivize the use of Huawei's other products, particularly its Ascend AI chips, which are China's primary competitors to Nvidia's advanced hardware. By coupling its software with its own hardware, Huawei is strengthening its position across the entire AI value chain, a key strategy as it navigates U.S. export restrictions.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the Communist Party's 104th anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech calling for stronger mechanisms to fight corruption by regulating the exercise of power. He stressed the need for improved public and media oversight to ensure government accountability and uncover power abuses. Xi urged party members to remember that "all power is granted by the people" and to address systemic shortcomings that allow for corruption. This continues a central theme of his leadership, which has focused on curbing excesses by party officials to maintain public trust.</p>
