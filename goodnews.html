        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the third quarter in a row, public companies have acquired more bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a strategic shift in corporate treasury management. In the second quarter, public firms added approximately 131,000 bitcoins, an 18% increase, compared to the 111,000 bitcoins added by ETFs. Analysts suggest companies are emulating Strategy's (formerly MicroStrategy) playbook of accumulating bitcoin to enhance shareholder value, a trend bolstered by a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. This move is seen as distinct from institutional ETF buying, which is more sensitive to market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Matt Maasdam, a former Navy SEAL, has announced his candidacy for Michigan's 7th Congressional District, becoming the second Democrat to challenge first-term Republican Representative Tom Barrett. The district, which includes Lansing, is considered one of the state's most competitive and was previously held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin before her successful Senate run. Maasdam is campaigning on his military background and a desire to find bipartisan solutions, setting up a competitive primary against former U.S. ambassador Bridget Brink. The race is a key target for Democrats seeking to regain a majority in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Claire McCardell: The Designer Who Set Women Free," examines the revolutionary impact of the American fashion designer who prioritized comfort and practicality. McCardell, a dominant force in the 1940s and 50s, introduced innovations like functional pockets, side fasteners, ballet flats, and denim for women's wear, fundamentally shaping the modern wardrobe. Despite her immense influence and creating the "American Look," her name is not as widely remembered as contemporaries like Christian Dior. The article reflects on her legacy as a pragmatic revolutionary who transformed how women dress, whether her name is remembered or not.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to empower content creators. The new policy requires website owners to opt-in to allow AI bots to access their content, aiming to prevent companies like OpenAI and Google from training their models without permission or compensation. Cloudflare, which handles a substantial portion of global internet traffic, argues that AI scraping deprives publishers of traffic and ad revenue. This change could significantly impact how AI developers gather data and may force them to negotiate for access.</p>
