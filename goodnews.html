        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul are in a dispute over the cancelled Constitution Pipeline, potentially impacting Coterra Energy. The pipeline project resurfaced after Trump lifted a stop-work order on the Empire Wind 1 project, with Coterra CEO Tom Jorden emphasizing the pipeline's importance for delivering natural gas to the New England market. If revived, Coterra, which has shifted its focus towards natural gas, could significantly benefit from the pipeline's capacity to transport gas from its Marcellus Shale properties. Roth analyst Leo Mariani predicts a bull market for gas, setting a price target on Coterra higher than the Club's, suggesting potential gains for the company.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, asserting that the cryptocurrency industry now has a champion in the White House with President Trump. The Trump administration aims to ease regulations, promote growth, and mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which Vance personally backs, viewing them as a hedge against bad policymaking and inflation. Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which the administration sees as a force multiplier for economic might. The conference also featured other Trump allies who have invested in crypto ventures, signaling the administration's growing embrace of digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise recent college graduates to begin saving for retirement immediately to take advantage of compound interest and long-term market benefits. Despite potential financial constraints, establishing an investment routine early is crucial for long-term financial stability. Investors should focus on low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in broad market indexes, with a heavier tilt towards stocks for younger investors. While market volatility may seem daunting, time in the market is more important than timing the market, emphasizing the importance of consistent investing habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as a strategy to meet emissions regulations and provide a steppingstone to all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume to roughly 20% by 2030, depending on regulations and customer acceptance. This expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, despite Toyota's continued investment in EVs. The performance of PHEVs is improving, and Toyota is assessing where to build them based on product strength versus the competition.</p>

          <p>Mars is phasing out titanium dioxide, a color additive banned in the European Union, from its US Skittles portfolio. The company stopped using the ingredient at the end of last year, following years of criticism and amid growing concerns about processed foods. The move also comes as President Trump's elevation of Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the Department of Health and Human Services has pushed concerns about processed foods to the front of public health debates. Mars had previously committed to removing all artificial colors from its foods, citing evolving consumer preferences, but did not explain the recent decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently imprisoned for charges including bank fraud and tax evasion. The Chrisleys were sentenced in 2022 for submitting false financial statements to obtain millions in personal loans and concealing income from the IRS. Trump stated that the couple received "pretty harsh treatment," following appeals from their daughter, Savannah, who claimed they were unfairly targeted. The Justice Department had previously emphasized the severity of their crimes, which involved exploiting the nation's banking system.</p>
