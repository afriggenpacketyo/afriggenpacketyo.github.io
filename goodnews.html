          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down a law that prevented men from taking their wives' surnames, ruling it constituted gender-based discrimination. The case was brought by two couples who argued the law was archaic, patriarchal, and violated the equality rights established in the post-apartheid constitution. Following the ruling, which was seen as a significant victory for gender equality, Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. The government did not oppose the couples' application in court.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency is backing a major infrastructure project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam, a key hub in the Yangtze Economic Belt. The initiative involves building a new double-line, five-stage lock system to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance the Gezhouba dam's capacity. With an estimated investment of 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), the project is described as the largest on the Yangtze River since the original dam's construction. This move is part of a broader push for strategic investment to drive economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled a significant shift in the country's geopolitical strategy, emphasizing that foreign policy is now the basis for all other policy areas, especially economic policy. In a keynote speech to German ambassadors, Merz described a new systemic conflict between liberal democracies and an "axis of autocracies," primarily China and Russia. He argued that Germany can no longer afford an isolationist attitude and must take a more active role on the international stage to protect its own interests. This new approach marks a departure from a more values-based foreign policy to one focused on German economic and strategic needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a first-of-its-kind ruling in Europe, a Spanish court has found that regional authorities violated residents' human rights by failing to control pollution from industrial pig farming. Residents in the Galicia region argued that excessive nitrate runoff from farm waste has contaminated drinking water, killed local wildlife, and degraded the natural environment. The court ordered authorities to compensate the claimants and implement measures to clean up the local river and prevent further pollution. The case could set a legal precedent for other communities across Europe facing similar environmental challenges from industrial agriculture.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have now been able to observationally verify a key theory about black holes proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. Hawking's area theorem states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. By analyzing the gravitational waves from a black hole merger detected earlier this year, researchers confirmed that the surface area of the new, combined black hole was greater than the sum of the two original black holes. This achievement, made possible by significant upgrades to gravitational wave detectors, provides powerful evidence for one of Hawking's foundational ideas.</p>

          <p>The California State Legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit public colleges and universities from punishing students who call 911 during a drug or alcohol overdose emergency. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, aims to remove the fear of academic probation or expulsion, which can deter students from seeking immediate medical help. Advocates argue this protection is crucial amid the ongoing opioid crisis, ensuring that students prioritize saving a life over concerns about disciplinary action. The bill requires schools to offer rehabilitation options instead of punishment for students who seek emergency assistance.</p>

          <p>Ghost, a giant Pacific octopus at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, has entered senescence, the final phase of her life. This natural life-cycle stage for female octopuses involves laying eggs and caring for them until they hatch, during which she will neglect her own needs and eventually die. Because Ghost did not have a mate, her eggs are unfertilized, but her maternal behavior remains the same, a situation that also occurs in the wild. The aquarium announced she will be moved behind the scenes to live out her final days caring for her eggs.</p>

          <p>Food critic Bill Addison reviews 88 Club, the new Beverly Hills restaurant from "Top Chef" winner Mei Lin, finding moments of brilliance alongside dishes that feel underdeveloped. The prawn toasts are highlighted as a standout creation, demonstrating Lin's talent for reconfiguring classic Chinese American snacks with precision and flair. However, the review notes that much of the broader menu, which explores regional Chinese cuisines, lacks the same strong, singular vision. While some dishes like the black bean clams are persuasive, others come off as beautifully plated but ultimately impassive, needing a stronger perspective to justify their fine-dining price point.</p>
