          <p>Zara owner Inditex reported first-quarter revenues slightly below expectations, with ‚Ç¨8.27 billion compared to the predicted ‚Ç¨8.39 billion. Net income also fell slightly short of estimates, coming in at ‚Ç¨1.3 billion. The company noted a slowdown in summer sales growth, increasing by 6% at constant currencies from May 1 to June 9, compared to 12% in the same period last year. CEO √ìscar Garc√≠a Maceiras had previously attributed a slowdown in demand to uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. This performance reflects broader economic uncertainties impacting consumer spending in the fashion retail sector. The optimism score is 65.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to PwC's 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report, the demand for formal degrees is declining, especially in fields exposed to artificial intelligence, because AI tools allow people to rapidly acquire expert knowledge. The skills employers seek are changing 66% faster in AI-exposed occupations compared to those least exposed. PwC Global Chief AI Officer Joe Atkinson suggests upskilling in AI to future-proof careers and adapt to the changing work landscape. The report indicates a shift towards valuing current skills over past education, potentially democratizing opportunities for those without formal degrees. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion explore themes of violence and suffering through queer and Arabian lenses. Thomas H√∂ft's "QueerPassion" references the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and tells stories of discriminated LGBTQ+ individuals. Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" addresses war, displacement, and oppression in the Middle East, incorporating Arabic instruments and vocals.

          <p>Germany is actively working to reduce its reliance on Russian gas by increasing imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from various sources, including the United States. The country is investing in new facilities to handle the increased LNG imports. This effort is part of a broader European strategy to diversify energy supplies and reduce dependence on Russia. The shift reflects geopolitical concerns and a desire for greater energy security. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Gregory May, the top U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong, is likely to assume a senior role in the United States‚Äô Beijing embassy. May, who has served as the U.S. consul general for Hong Kong and Macau since September 2022, is considered a top candidate for a ministerial position. His new role would make him a key advisor to the new American ambassador, David Perdue, during a critical period in U.S.-China relations. May's pragmatism and experience are seen as valuable assets in managing the complex relationship. The optimism score is 60.</p>
