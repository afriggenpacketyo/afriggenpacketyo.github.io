          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The outage affected about 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas, with officials reporting that an electricity substation was set on fire and a pylon was damaged. Despite the disruption, organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the suspected arson.</p>

          <p>Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi's film "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant moment for a director previously banned from leaving Iran. The award was presented by Cate Blanchett, and the film extends Neon's streak of backing Palme d'Or winners. The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage suspected to be arson, but power was restored in time for the event. Panahi, who was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike, has continued to make award-winning films despite restrictions.</p>

          <p>French authorities have confirmed that a power outage in the Cannes area, which disrupted the film festival, was caused by sabotage. The outage was a result of arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower, leaving approximately 160,000 homes without power. While the festival experienced temporary interruptions, organizers managed to switch to backup power, ensuring the closing ceremony proceeded as planned. Local prosecutors have launched investigations into the sabotage, though the motives remain unclear.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it approached the Pentagon on May 1, resulting in two commercial jets aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The temporary loss of contact caused confusion among air traffic controllers, who were unable to confidently fix the helicopter's location. The Army believes a temporary antenna was the cause of the lost contact and has since moved it to the roof of the Pentagon. The incident added to concerns about close calls between military helicopters and commercial planes near the airport.</p>

          <p>California has begun to create new wetlands on the shore of the shrinking Salton Sea in an effort to provide habitat for fish and birds and control dust. State officials celebrated the filling of a complex of shallow ponds as a major milestone in addressing the environmental problems plaguing the lake. The Species Conservation Habitat Project is expected to cover more than 9,000 acres and is funded by a combination of state and federal resources. The project aims to create lower-salinity habitats for wildlife and suppress harmful dust in nearby communities.</p>

Although Sikandar Raza made 60, England chipped away at the other end. The undoubted highlight was Harry Brook's spectacular catch at second slip to remove Wesley Madhevere, Ben Stokes' third wicket of the match on his return from hamstring surgery.</p>
