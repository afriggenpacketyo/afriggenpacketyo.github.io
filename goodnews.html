          <p>The US National Guard, a reserve component of the US Armed Forces, is typically deployed for disaster relief and ensuring internal security. It consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, with approximately 419,000 reservists. The National Guard can be commanded by the state governor during in-state deployments, but the US president is the commander-in-chief when deployed nationwide. In a recent move, President Trump overrode California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles, citing national security concerns, a decision Newsom criticized as inflammatory.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles as a framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea, emphasizing consultation, co-management, cooperation, and non-interference. The Xinhua Institute report blames regional tensions on external actors fueling rival claimants' actions and undermining maritime cooperation. China asserts its commitment to managing differences and exercising restraint, advocating for peaceful resolution and mutually beneficial outcomes. These principles were initially presented in 2002 through an agreement with ASEAN, amidst ongoing disputes over territorial claims.</p>

Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat with a majority of 602 votes.

The author suggests that Trump's actions have ironically reduced America's ability to influence China through cultural or ideological means, as the US has stopped lecturing others on governance.</p>

          <p>Arthur Sze's poem "Under a Supermoon" reflects on the beauty and minutiae of life, contrasting it with the vastness of space exploration. The speaker expresses a lack of desire for grand adventures, instead finding joy in simple observations like the color of leaves and the smell of pi√±on. The poem references Blake's idea that persisting in folly leads to wisdom, suggesting the speaker has persevered and now appreciates the exploding and birthing stars within life.

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were forced to take a bus to their final destination after their plane was diverted to Rome. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, deemed too large to land in Naples, rerouted to Rome Fiumicino Airport due to "operational limitations." American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route, which is approximately 20 feet shorter than the 787-9.

          <p>President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs is challenged by the aviation industry's struggle to hire skilled workers. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic is 54, with 40% over 60, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Companies are trying to attract younger people, but the industry lost talent during Covid-19. While wages have increased, some argue they are still insufficient, and experts note that the worker shortage is not limited to repair technicians but also includes air traffic controllers.</p>

The filter works by informing the app's matching algorithm based on user preferences.

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by spreading information about misoprostol and creating accompaniment networks. Activists, doctors, and researchers collaborated to gather evidence and share knowledge, despite legal restrictions. The story highlights the work of Las Libres in Mexico and Socorristas en Red in Argentina, who developed innovative methods to support women throughout the abortion process. These efforts contributed to the legalization of abortion in Argentina and inspired similar movements across the region, showing how grassroots activism and access to information can empower women.</p>

          <p>Scotland has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's Callan McKenna to address a goalkeeping crisis ahead of Monday's friendly in Liechtenstein. Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie have left the squad following Friday's defeat by Iceland, and Cieran Slicker suffered a torrid debut. Head coach Steve Clarke admitted he was looking for another goalkeeper not on holiday, with Craig Gordon, Zander Clark, and Liam Kelly already missing. Doohan and McKenna have been added to the squad to address the shortage.</p>
