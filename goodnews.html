          <p>Global financial markets reacted favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocks President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. U.S. stock futures and oil prices rose, while the U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen and euro. The court determined that the 1977 Act does not authorize the use of tariffs, although the White House has appealed the decision. Investors seemed encouraged by the ruling, hoping it would alleviate months of market turmoil caused by Trump's trade war; this is in spite of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs.

          <p>English Premiership rugby is experiencing a significant shift as several long-standing players, including Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs, and Alex Goode, retire from the sport. These players, who were instrumental in England's victory over New Zealand in 2012, are now concluding their careers, marking the end of an era. Danny Care also bows out alongside these legends. The retirements reflect a changing landscape in rugby, with younger players increasingly taking the place of seasoned veterans.</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed its plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of ¬£25 billion "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth. The overhaul, inspired by Australian and Canadian pension investment funds, aims to improve returns for workers and increase investment in clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is including a legislative backstop for enforcement if necessary. The changes are expected to have significant implications for how pension schemes operate, potentially improving retirement outcomes through better governance and investment diversification.

          <p>A federal court in New York blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world.

          <p>German tank parts maker Renk is looking to hire talent from the auto sector as it races to scale up and fuel growth in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions and soaring military spending. The company is seeing a range of applicants from the automotive industry and is benefiting from incorporating such experts. Analysts say that overcapacity is an issue across Europe's auto industry, particularly in Germany, where they estimate 100,000 jobs are now at risk. There is "a historic opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by turning some of [Germany's] automaking prowess to military production," the analysts commented.</p>

          <p>Colin Rosler, son of Manchester City cult hero Uwe Rosler, has strived to create his own identity in football. Despite playing in Norway youth teams with Erling Haaland, Rosler has taken a different path to establish his career. The 25-year-old centre-back has become a league champion and a full international, with Haaland coincidentally present for both milestones. Rosler emphasizes his focus on being his own person and not relying on his father's legacy.</p>

          <p>Remember Monday, the UK's first all-female group in Eurovision since 1999, is planning their next steps after finishing 19th in the competition. The trio from Hampshire and Berkshire, who co-wrote "What The Hell Just Happened?", say they are about to have the "summer of our dreams." They are preparing to go on tour across the UK, with appearances at music festivals including Isle of Wight, Latitude, and The Big Feastival. The group, who received 88 points from the national juries but none from the public vote, said the competition had given them "memories that will last a lifetime."</p>
