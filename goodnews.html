          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines could delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting their use to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services has indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation. This change has prompted debate among scientific advisors about whether to continue recommending immunization for all Americans or to adopt a risk-based strategy. Concerns have also been raised about the future of vaccine infrastructure and potential impacts on childhood immunization schedules.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is reportedly planning to discontinue routine recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations for children and pregnant women. This shift would mark a significant departure from the broad vaccination approach during the pandemic's early years. The move comes as the FDA prepares to implement a stricter approval process for vaccines, and reflects Kennedy's long-standing criticism of mRNA vaccines and mass vaccination campaigns. Critics fear this change could discourage vaccination and leave vulnerable populations at risk.</p>

          <p>Harvard University discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta, purchased for $27.50, is actually a rare version from 1300 issued by King Edward I, worth millions. Researchers confirmed the authenticity of the document by comparing it to other known copies and using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace. The discovery highlights the enduring relevance of the Magna Carta, especially in discussions about individual liberty and self-governance.</p>
