This commendation arrives as the U.S. administration reportedly explores acquiring equity stakes in tech firms receiving CHIPS Act funding, with TSMC promised $6.6 billion for Arizona plants. Huang's primary visit to Taiwan was to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, highlighting TSMC's role in developing six new products for Nvidia. Separately, an article reported Nvidia paused H20 chip production for China following security concerns raised by Beijing, despite earlier export license approvals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption surged to a historic high of 1.02 trillion kilowatt-hours in July, marking an 8.6% year-on-year increase. This unprecedented demand, equivalent to the annual usage of all Asean nations combined, was primarily driven by scorching heatwaves across the country. The primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, experienced the fastest growth in electricity use, up 20.2% compared to the previous year. Despite this significant energy surge, industrial output growth in July slowed compared to June, suggesting a complex interplay between environmental factors, such as extreme weather, and the broader economic activity in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted of a royal defamation charge, known as lese majeste, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the evidence and witnesses too weak, suggesting potential political bias in the prosecution stemming from his opponents. This acquittal provides a significant reprieve for the Shinawatra family, especially as Thaksin's daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the current prime minister, faces a separate ethics case that could lead to her removal. Despite past convictions and a controversial return from 15 years of exile, Thaksin has largely avoided significant prison time, maintaining a high public profile that continues to challenge Thailand's powerful conservative establishment.</p>

This development signals Beijing's intensified push for chip self-sufficiency amidst Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and Chinese scrutiny of Nvidia's H20 chips. The move comes after reports of China urging domestic AI developers to use local alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs, and DeepSeek's previous success in training models with less advanced Nvidia chips.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing slight signs of warming, with existing home sales rising 2% in July, though overall sales remain significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels. A key positive development is the highest inventory of homes for sale in five years, offering buyers more options and leverage, even as homes take slightly longer to sell. While nationwide median prices saw a minimal increase, many major metro areas experienced price softening, particularly in the South and West. Mortgage rates have also inched down, though experts predict rates will remain near 6.6% through year-end, with potential for further slight dips in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has backed down from imposing high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, agreeing to limit them to 15% in a new trade deal. This decision follows earlier threats by President Trump to raise pharmaceutical tariffs to as high as 250%, driven by a desire to boost domestic production. Under the agreement, the U.S. will apply the 15% tariff rate on most European goods, including semiconductors and lumber, from September 1st. In return, the EU is expected to reduce tariffs on "all US industrial goods" to zero, with a further reduction on European car exports to 15% contingent on EU legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified an earlier order concerning stray dogs in New Delhi, now directing that the animals be caught for sterilization and immunization before release, unless they exhibit rabies infection or aggressive behavior. The court also barred public feeding of stray dogs, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action against violators. This revised directive comes after an initial order for mass removal sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists, who called it "illogical" and "inhuman." The court aims to frame a nationwide policy, balancing public safety concerns over dog bites with animal welfare, as New Delhi faces nearly 2,000 dog bite incidents daily.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March but still higher than economists' 3% forecast. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, while "core-core" inflation remained steady at 3.4%. The easing was primarily driven by a deceleration in rice inflation, which had previously soared due to a shortage. Despite the moderation, this article notes that the 3.1% headline inflation marks the 40th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, prompting some experts to criticize the BOJ for being "behind the curve" in raising interest rates.

          <p>The UK government is expanding its crackdown on individuals claiming child benefit while residing outside the country, aiming to save £350 million over the next five years. New rules stipulate that claimants abroad for over eight weeks will generally be ineligible, unless exceptional circumstances apply. A new specialist team, set to expand to over 200 investigators, will use travel data to identify incorrect payments, following a pilot program that already saved £17 million by stopping payments to 2,600 people. This article highlights the government's renewed efforts to tackle benefit fraud and overpayments, which increased post-pandemic, by enhancing investigative capabilities and raising awareness of eligibility rules for this widely accessed benefit.</p>
