          <h2>NJ Transit Strike Ends as Engineers Approve Tentative Agreement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a three-day strike that disrupted commutes for hundreds of thousands, NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen reached an agreement, ending New Jersey's first rail strike in decades. Train service is set to resume on Tuesday, following inspections of train cars and tracks. The deal, described as fair and fiscally responsible by NJ Transit officials, involves work rule concessions that will offset wage increases. The strike had been prompted by the union's argument that engineers were underpaid compared to neighboring transit agencies, and that the cost of living had gone up in New Jersey.</p>

He had previously been suspended in March 2023 for impartiality issues related to a post about a government asylum policy.

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his third major title with a dominant performance at the PGA Championship, finishing five shots ahead of the competition.

Jon Rahm, who had mounted a challenge, faltered in the final holes, while Bryson DeChambeau finished in a tie for second place. Scheffler's victory marks his 15th PGA Tour win and solidifies his position as the world's number one golfer.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, 'Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer,' explores the work of Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor from Massachusetts who taught FBI agents how to profile serial killers. Burgess began interviewing sexual assault victims in the 1960s, identifying behavioral patterns that linked petty crime to sexual assault and murder. Her work with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit involved analyzing hundreds of hours of interviews with serial killers, and she faced sexism while working in a male-dominated field. Now, at 88, Burgess continues to teach and works with her granddaughter on profiling school shooters.</p>

The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, argues that the US dollar is losing its status as a safe currency and that the yuan is a viable alternative. To compete with the dollar, China needs to deepen its financial markets to allow easier access to yuan-denominated assets and create new asset classes.</p>
