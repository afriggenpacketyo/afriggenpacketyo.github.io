          <p>European airlines are facing challenges in meeting soaring summer travel demand due to delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, resulting in a shortage of commercial jets. Despite the capacity issues, EasyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis remains optimistic, noting that bookings for the third and fourth quarters are ahead of last year. The airline reported a pre-tax loss for the first half of the year but expects to meet full-year profit expectations. However, investors appeared disappointed as shares of EasyJet traded down 4%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the U.S. starting in June, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to tariffs. While Nike did not explicitly cite U.S. tariffs as the reason, the company stated that it regularly makes price adjustments. The move comes as almost all of Nike's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with prices rising by as much as $10.</p>

The education department has announced ¬£615m to cover the rises, but schools will be asked to partially fund the awards through "improved productivity and smarter spending".</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai has seemingly softened his stance on mainland China, omitting any mention of cross-strait relations in a recent address. This marks a departure from his previous rhetoric, where he asserted Taiwan's independence and described Beijing as a "hostile foreign force". Lai has also extended an olive branch to opposition parties, offering briefings on national security matters. This shift in tone is seen as a calculated move to foster dialogue and ease tensions with Beijing.</p>
