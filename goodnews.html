          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory after securing a strong lead in the first round of voting, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo conceding the race. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on momentum among younger voters and a progressive platform focused on economic issues. Cuomo's concession came as a surprise, with his campaign indicating he may consider an independent run in the general election. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected in mid-July, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is also running as an independent in the fall.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup's scheduling in the U.S. summer has highlighted the challenges of playing soccer in extreme heat, raising concerns for the upcoming 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico. European teams, accustomed to cooler climates, may struggle with the high temperatures, while teams from countries like Brazil, used to playing in the heat, could have an advantage. While historical data from past tournaments doesn't definitively show European teams wilting, the scheduling of games to suit European viewers rather than prioritizing player safety remains a concern, prompting calls for better planning.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has dismissed a recent CIA campaign to recruit informants from China as a desperate attempt to justify its budget. The MSS claims the CIA is exaggerating the "China threat" to secure more funding from Congress. This response follows the CIA's release of Chinese-language videos aimed at exploiting dissatisfaction among Chinese officials and encouraging them to leak secrets.

          <p>A dietitian addresses common misconceptions about bananas, highlighting their nutritional value and debunking fears about their sugar content. Bananas are rich in essential fiber, vitamins, and minerals, including potassium, magnesium, and vitamin C. They promote heart health, support good digestion, boost mood and energy, enhance workout performance, and aid in fighting illness. The nutritional makeup of bananas shifts as they ripen, with greener bananas containing less sugar and more resistant starch, while ripe bananas are easier to digest and offer more tryptophan and vitamin B6.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that stem cell therapy using stem cells from human fat may offer a potential solution for hair loss, according to a recent study on mice. Male mice treated with low-dose stem cells combined with an energy-boosting molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) showed the best hair regrowth. The researchers achieved a high degree of hair regrowth in both male and female mice with appropriate doses, but caution that human clinical trials are still needed to confirm these benefits. Human trials are being planned to confirm safety for men and women with androgenetic alopecia.</p>

          <p>The term "bruh," now commonly used by Gen Alpha, has a rich history rooted in the word "brother" and shaped by internet culture. Originating in the 16th century as an abbreviation of "brother" to "bro", the term evolved through African American folklore and later internet memes. The Vine app popularized "bruh" as a sound effect associated with comedic failure. Today, "bruh" serves as a versatile expression used to convey a range of emotions, from shock and confusion to excitement and despair, making it a key element of Gen Alpha's slang.</p>

          <p>Despite heightened tensions in the Middle East, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran, oil prices have not experienced the dramatic spikes that would typically signal an oil crisis. Several factors contribute to this resilience, including Iran's decision not to target oil supplies, traders' skepticism toward fear-driven price surges, the approaching autumn season, an oversupplied oil market, and the dominance of the U.S. as a major oil producer. The shale revolution in the U.S. has reduced global dependence on Middle Eastern oil, mitigating the impact of regional conflicts on the market.</p>

Heat exhaustion, characterized by headache, fatigue, and heavy sweating, can be managed by moving to a cool place, drinking water, and applying cold cloths. Heat stroke, a more severe condition with symptoms including impaired consciousness and high body temperature, requires immediate medical attention and rapid cooling measures. Prevention involves avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and protecting the head with a hat.</p>
