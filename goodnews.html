          <p>Russell Martin is on the verge of being appointed as the new manager for the Rangers. While some accuse him of being reluctant to adapt, former teammate Angus Gunn disputes this, citing Martin's pragmatic approach with Southampton in the English Championship. Martin himself asserts that there's a difference between being stubborn and having conviction in one's approach. This suggests that while Martin's principles will remain, he is capable of adapting his strategies when necessary.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to move Greenland from U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command, signaling a shift in how the U.S. views the island's strategic importance. This move suggests that the U.S. considers Greenland more as part of its own defense perimeter, similar to Canada, rather than as a part of Europe. Top Trump officials have reportedly pressed Greenland to break from Denmark and come under U.S. security protection. The move is driven by Greenland's strategic location and its rare earth minerals.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer and Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Wells Fargo's future after the Federal Reserve removed the bank's $1.95 trillion asset cap. Analysts forecast more upside for the stock, citing the bank's ability to grow its deposit base, invest in high-growth areas, and reduce compliance costs. The asset cap had been in place for seven years due to past misdeeds, including the fake accounts scandal. The removal of the cap is seen as a fundamental change for the bank and its CEO.

Kennedy believes medical schools should focus more on preventing diet-driven conditions and less on prescribing drugs.

Some medical schools say they already offer sufficient nutrition education, but others acknowledge the need for consistent standards.</p>
