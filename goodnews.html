The Coast Guard is monitoring the vessel, which remains afloat with smoke emanating from it. All 22 crew members were safely evacuated, and the incident is prompting calls for improved emergency response protocols for North Sea shipping routes following a similar deadly fire in 2023.</p>

While delaying Social Security can result in higher monthly checks, it is important to consider the opportunity cost of lost investment growth within the 401(k). The decision depends on factors such as market returns, the size of the nest egg, and individual financial circumstances. A simple calculation may have you believe that it‚Äôs best to delay collecting Social Security as long as possible, but this theoretical calculation is done in a vacuum and doesn‚Äôt consider any other factors.
