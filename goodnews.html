          <p>A detailed analysis examines the scale of financial and military support provided to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, challenging some political claims about the distribution of aid. According to the Kiel Institute, the combined contributions from European nations have surpassed those of the United States, which remains the largest single-country donor. The article also clarifies the composition of this support, noting that US aid has predominantly been in the form of grants, whereas European Union assistance has included a larger proportion of loans, albeit on generous terms for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned that the artificial intelligence market may be in an investment bubble, comparing the current surge of investor excitement to the dot-com era of the late 1990s. While he maintains that AI is a transformative technology for the long term, he believes the market is currently in an overvalued and overexcited phase. This cautionary sentiment echoes similar warnings from other financial experts who have raised concerns that investment in the AI sector is moving too quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

Court filings revealed internal communications showing that Newsmax officials were aware that the conspiracy theories they were platforming were baseless, yet continued to air them.</p>

          <p>To honor the late rapper and community activist Nipsey Hussle on what would have been his 40th birthday, a Los Angeles Metro station has been temporarily renamed in his honor. The Hyde Park Station near Crenshaw and Slauson will be called the "Nipsey Hussle Station" through the end of the month. This tribute, part of Metro's Culture Series, celebrates his legacy and deep impact on his South Los Angeles community, with limited-edition TAP cards also being released.</p>

          <p>A revamped mixed doubles tournament at the US Open is generating significant buzz by attracting many of the world's top singles players, including Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek, and Novak Djokovic. With a condensed schedule before the main draw and a substantially increased prize pool of $1 million for the winners, the event has successfully drawn star power. However, the new format has faced criticism from doubles specialists, many of whom were unable to enter due to the entry criteria favoring higher-ranked singles players.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the first over-the-counter birth control pill in the U.S. is effectively reaching people who previously faced barriers to contraception. Researchers found that nearly one-third of individuals who obtained the pill had previously used no method of birth control at all. An additional 41% switched from less-effective methods like condoms. The findings suggest that removing the prescription requirement has successfully expanded access, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural populations.</p>

          <p>This article explains how investors can utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to enhance their long-term returns through the power of compound interest. By opting to have stock dividends automatically reinvested to purchase more shares, even fractional ones, investors can passively grow their holdings over time. Using the S&P 500 as an example, the article demonstrates that the total return with dividends reinvested was significantly higher over a decade than the return from price appreciation alone, making it a powerful strategy for wealth building.

In the story, the detectives of this unit lament that this single act has ruined their 25-year perfect record of preventing sandwich-based crime, parodying over-the-top law enforcement responses and the nature of crime statistics.</p>

          <p>Financial experts weigh in on the best age for seniors to consider a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows homeowners to access their home equity without selling. While the minimum age to qualify is 62, many experts suggest the ideal time is often in the late 60s or early 70s. At this stage, borrowers can typically access a larger loan amount and have a clearer understanding of their long-term financial needs, health, and whether they plan to age in place, all crucial factors in the decision.
