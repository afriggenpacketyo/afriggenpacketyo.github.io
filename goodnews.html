        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices reaching new records, investors are increasingly turning to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for most people to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than owning physical bullion, which involves higher costs. Despite its strong performance, financial advisors generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion of a diversified portfolio, typically less than 3%, due to its volatility.

          <p>The article presents an analysis of Oklo, a nuclear startup focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs) to power AI data centers, suggesting it has high-growth potential. It highlights the company's backing by figures like OpenAI's Sam Altman, its selection for a U.S. Department of Energy pilot program, and its specific focus on the AI industry. While the investment is considered speculative and high-risk as the technology is still unproven, the article posits that a successful prototype could cause its stock price to skyrocket.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Spain's La Liga Prioritizes Financial Sustainability Over High Spending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 05:08:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spain's La Liga has adopted a strategy of strict financial control, prioritizing long-term sustainability over the massive spending seen in leagues like the English Premier League. This approach was implemented in 2013 to combat widespread club bankruptcy and debt, introducing salary caps and requiring clubs to only spend what they generate. While this has led to financial stability and made clubs more attractive to investors, it has also limited their spending power in the transfer market. The league's resilience is now bolstered by its world-class youth academies, which consistently produce top talent and ensure competitive success on the European stage.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create cinematic videos depicting biblical stories, which have gained millions of views on social media, particularly among younger audiences. The company, which runs the "AI Bible" YouTube channel, sees this as a modern way to engage people with scripture, calling it the "Marvel Universe of faith." However, some theologians are critical, arguing that the approach reduces the Bible to mere entertainment and an action movie, stripping it of its spiritual depth and transformative power. The debate highlights the ongoing intersection of modern technology and ancient religious texts.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, which will be visible across much of the United Kingdom, turning the full moon a deep red color in an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle happens when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility in the UK will depend on location, with eastern areas getting the best and longest view after moonrise. Astronomers advise finding a clear view of the horizon to witness the event, which is the last total lunar eclipse visible from the UK until August 2026.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his devout faith and his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican, a move seen as an effort to inspire and connect with younger generations of Catholics. The ceremony follows the attribution of two miracles to Acutis, a requirement for sainthood, and has drawn over a million pilgrims to his tomb in Assisi, Italy.</p>

          <p>Photographer Dennis Morris shares the story of how, as a 14-year-old, he bunked off school to meet Bob Marley and ended up becoming his official tour photographer. This pivotal moment launched a remarkable career that saw him capture iconic images of many music legends, including the Sex Pistols during the chaotic height of the punk scene. Morris explains that his ambition was always to be a war photographer, and he found a version of that conflict in documenting the volatile energy of the Pistols. His work, which also includes documentary projects on London communities, is currently featured in a major exhibition.</p>
