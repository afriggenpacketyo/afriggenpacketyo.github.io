          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is facing his first major test in the general election, amidst concerns over potential impacts from tariffs imposed by the US. The election is seen as a gauge of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has ruled Singapore since 1965, and Wong's leadership. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing availability, while the PAP emphasizes its efforts to help citizens cope with these challenges. A strong showing for the PAP would solidify Wong's leadership, while a significant opposition presence would push for greater scrutiny and debate in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges such as inflation and housing affordability, as well as navigating relations with a volatile Washington. Voters express concerns about the rising cost of living, though both major parties have offered small-scale measures to alleviate economic pressures. The election also reflects a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, signaling dissatisfaction with traditional political offerings. The opposition leader's adoption of some buzzwords similar to President Trump's is also being considered by voters.</p>

          <p>The blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has led to an "unparalleled" antivenom, according to scientists. Antibodies in his blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal tests. This could be a significant step toward a universal antivenom, addressing the issue of snakebites that kill up to 140,000 people annually. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, and his work has identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that can target classes of neurotoxins.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency's rise against the US dollar, driven by capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to maintain the currency's trading band. This intervention precedes a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further increase capital inflow to Hong Kong.

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate power. This includes trimming bureaucracy, reorganizing ministries, and reducing public sector jobs by 15%. The reforms aim to address dysfunction from the anti-corruption campaign and prepare for potential US tariffs. Analysts suggest the changes also serve to consolidate power under the new party chief, To Lam, ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress.</p>
