The company's sales grew 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, driven by strong advertising performance attributed to advancements in its AI systems. Meta also issued a third-quarter revenue forecast that was higher than anticipated and announced increased capital expenditures, partly due to a significant investment in the AI startup Scale AI.

Lindsey and Tim Pierce of Ohio welcomed their son, Thaddeus, after adopting an embryo that was created via IVF in 1994. The embryo donor, Linda Archerd, had used one of four embryos to have her own daughter 30 years ago and preserved the others. She chose the Pierce family through a Christian embryo adoption agency, wanting to be involved in the child's life.</p>

          <p>Survivors of recent wildfires in Los Angeles County are turning to modular homes as a way to rebuild their lives and properties more quickly. The article highlights the experience of Steve and Charlotte Gibson, whose home was destroyed in the Eaton Fire, as they work with a startup that constructs accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in a factory. This method of construction offers a faster alternative to traditional building, helping families navigate the confusing and lengthy process of recovery after losing their homes. The approach could provide a model for disaster recovery in other fire-prone areas.</p>

The offering values the company at $19.3 billion and raised $1.2 billion, with the stock set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange. This IPO comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2023 due to regulatory opposition. The successful pricing indicates a receptive public market for tech IPOs, following other strong debuts earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Younger Generations in India Are Redefining Spirituality and Religious Engagement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 08:54:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, India's youth, particularly Gen Z, are reconnecting with spirituality, but on their own terms. Many young Indians identify as "spiritual but not religious," using faith and practices like meditation as a way to find solace and improve mental health in a chaotic modern world. This trend is characterized by a more personalized approach, focusing less on traditional rituals and more on what resonates individually. Social media, spiritual influencers, and government promotion of Hindu heritage sites have also made these practices more accessible and appealing to younger demographics.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs represent a relatively affordable borrowing option in the current high-interest-rate environment. As of late July 2025, the average interest rate for a 15-year home equity loan is around 8.34%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.26%, both considerably lower than typical personal loan or credit card rates. These financial products can also offer tax benefits if the funds are used for eligible home renovations. However, homeowners must be cautious as the home serves as collateral for the loan.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While the national average yield for a one-year CD is just over 2%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some reaching 4.40% APY for similar terms. Experts note that due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide higher rates than long-term ones. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to look at online banks, which have lower overhead, and consider laddering CDs of various term lengths to balance high returns with long-term goals.

          <p>Gold remains an attractive safe-haven asset for investors, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. As of late July 2025, the price of gold is approximately $3,306 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. Key factors influencing its price include supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The inverse relationship with interest rates and the strength of the U.S. dollar also play significant roles in determining gold's value, making it a complex but historically stable investment commodity for many.

          <p>This article suggests that investors with available capital might consider purchasing high-yielding dividend stocks that are currently trading near their yearly lows, which could offer both income and potential for capital gains. It identifies Lockheed Martin, Colgate-Palmolive, and Pembina Pipeline as three such companies. Despite recent stock price struggles, the article argues their underlying businesses remain solid, and their dividend payouts appear safe and sustainable. For example, Lockheed Martin's free cash flow is noted as being more than double its dividend payments, suggesting a secure yield. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched formal investigations into four companies that operate a total of 34 pornography websites. The probes will determine if these sites are complying with new age verification rules mandated by the Online Safety Act, which are designed to prevent children from accessing adult content. These sites reportedly have a combined total of over nine million monthly visitors. This action is part of a broader enforcement push by Ofcom, which has also opened investigations into other platforms like 4chan over similar concerns.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has indicated that it does not consider imposing a network fee on large technology companies to be a workable solution for funding the rollout of 5G and broadband infrastructure. This stance addresses a long-standing debate between major European telecom operators, who want Big Tech to contribute to network costs, and tech giants like Google and Netflix, who oppose the idea. A White House fact sheet released after a recent EU-U.S. trade deal also noted that the EU confirmed it would not adopt such fees, a point the Commission clarified applies to all companies, not just American ones.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to the UK government for the expansion of Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's own owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk and could be delivered for under £25 billion, with the new runway operational by 2035. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally invited for the long-debated expansion project.</p>

          <p>A late-stage clinical trial showed that Eli Lilly's diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offered significant cardiovascular health benefits when compared directly to its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found that Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with Type 2 diabetes and established heart disease. Mounjaro also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and provided greater kidney protection. These results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for this high-risk patient population.</p>
