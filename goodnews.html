          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing a plan to bar foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction against the administration's move, which cited national security concerns. Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against the university for refusing to accede to demands to control the school's governance and curriculum. The university had filed lawsuits seeking to unfreeze funding and prevent restrictions on international students after accusations of fostering violence and antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" of missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the warning, which allowed for no casualties or injuries. This statement seemed to confirm speculation that Iran would telegraph its retaliation plans, enabling the U.S. to minimize damage and avoid escalation.

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel stated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping passage, as it would harm its own interests. Despite reports that Iran's parliament approved the closure, Braziel noted that Iran has threatened to close the strait for over 20 years without doing so. He explained that Iran exports 1.7 million barrels of oil daily through the strait, and closing it would significantly impact its economy. Braziel also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Trump's campaign promises to avoid "never-ending wars," these voters trust him to protect American interests and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Some voters saw the strikes as a preventative measure to avoid a larger conflict, while others emphasized the need to support Trump's decisions based on access to national security intelligence.
