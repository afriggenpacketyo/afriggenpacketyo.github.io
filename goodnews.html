          <h2>Repurposed EV Batteries Offer Sustainable Power Solution for AI Data Centers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:47:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Used electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to power artificial intelligence data centers, offering a renewable energy solution to the AI industry's growing electricity demands. Crusoe, an AI cloud platform, is utilizing these batteries from Redwood Materials in Nevada to keep its data centers running day and night, addressing the struggle for reliable and fast power access. This innovative approach helps sidestep the environmental impact of traditional gas-fired plants, with Redwood Materials recovering significant gigawatt hours of lithium-ion batteries annually. The company, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, believes this modular system can be widely scaled, providing a sustainable alternative for energy storage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued after becoming lost in a remote California forest, thanks to the mother's quick thinking and handwritten notes. The Calaveras County Volunteer Search and Rescue Team, aided by a location-sharing app and air support, located the pair's vehicle after following a series of notes left at intersections. Despite challenges with cell and radio signals in the thick forest, rescuers used amateur radio to coordinate the operation. The family had become disoriented after their GPS diverted them onto remote backroads, but their survival skills, including the son's use of a whistle, and informing someone of their itinerary proved crucial for their safe return.</p>

          <h2>Alaska Tsunami Advisory Lifted Following 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:31:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been lifted, following a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake that initially prompted a warning. The seismic event, occurring about 50 miles south of Sand Point, led to evacuations in coastal towns like Seward, though experts quickly noted that large, widespread waves were not expected due to the earthquake's shallow depth. Multiple aftershocks were reported near Sand Point, and the U.S. Coast Guard temporarily evacuated personnel at its Kodiak base before standing down. This incident highlights Alaska's location along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," recalling the region's history of major seismic events.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed a crucial bipartisan bill designed to prevent thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure, addressing a crisis caused by the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) previous program cancellations. The new legislation allows veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move those missed payments to the end of their loan term, effectively making their loans current. This fix comes after the VA abruptly ended a Biden-era homeowner assistance program, leaving many veterans vulnerable, and aims to restore stability to the VA's home loan program, which has faced significant self-inflicted challenges. The measure is widely supported by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from corn syrup to real cane sugar in its flagship drinks sold in the U.S., a move he championed due to health concerns raised by his Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While Coca-Cola's spokesperson offered a non-committal response, Trump expressed confidence in the "very good move." This change, if fully implemented, would align U.S. products with those sold in many other countries. However, the Corn Refiners Association warns this shift could negatively impact American corn farmers, manufacturing jobs, and increase foreign sugar imports, with no proven nutritional benefit.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 694,000 Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs from model years 2020-2024 due to a faulty fuel injector that can crack and leak fuel, posing a fire risk. The recall involves vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. As an interim safety measure, dealers will update the engine control software to detect a cracked injector, disable the high-pressure fuel pump, and reduce ignition source temperatures, though this is not a permanent fix. Owners will be notified in August and again when a final remedy is available. This expands on previous recalls for the same issue, adding to Ford's substantial list of vehicle recalls this year.</p>

          <p>A recent Vanguard report highlights strategies for boosting 401(k) savings, particularly by maximizing employer matching contributions. With 86% of Vanguard 401(k) plans offering some form of match, taking full advantage can significantly increase retirement funds. For example, contributing an additional $300 annually to reach a full employer match on a $60,000 salary could lead to over $150,000 in additional savings over a career. This "free money" from employer matches is presented as one of the most effective ways to save for retirement, emphasizing that consistent contributions and utilizing available perks can substantially grow savings over time.
