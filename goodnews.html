          <p>In response to tariffs imposed by the United States, China is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help exporters focus on the domestic market.

Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can be used for both physical goods and services, providing flexibility for businesses adapting to changing trade conditions.

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth reserves in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have impacted various industries globally. Officials are evaluating how India Rare Earths, a government-owned company, can increase rare earth magnet production. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but significant public and private investment is needed. The move comes as China's dominance in rare earth production and processing has given it considerable leverage over the supply of minerals crucial for modern technologies.</p>

          <p>The revamped FIFA Club World Cup is set to begin in the U.S., featuring 32 teams competing for a new trophy and a substantial prize pool. This expanded tournament marks a significant shift from previous versions, but it has faced controversy due to concerns about an already congested soccer calendar.
