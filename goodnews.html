          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals with experience in destinations like the Maldives and Bali, discuss the differences between vacationing and living in paradise. They emphasize the communal aspect of staff villages, akin to summer camps, and the challenges of managing diverse personalities within these communities. Saltwater-related maintenance issues and environmental concerns, such as humidity and forest reclamation, also present unique challenges. Despite the challenges, LeBlanc and Robinson value their experiences and enjoy sharing their story with curious hotel guests, finding fulfillment in their work and life together in remote locations.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth unmanned test flight of the Starship spacecraft from its Starbase facility in Texas, aiming to achieve a safe and reliable return. This test follows two previous flights that resulted in the destruction of the spacecraft and debris falling across South Florida and parts of the Atlantic. The company has made modifications based on lessons learned from the previous failures, including hardware and vibration-related issues. The current test involves the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, with the booster attempting a hard splashdown in the Gulf after testing new flight and landing configurations, and the Starship upper stage aiming to deploy Starlink satellite simulators and relight a Raptor engine in space.</p>

O'Connell, inspired by other authors who created treasure hunts, hopes to engage readers with American history and encourage outdoor activity.

          <p>Curtis Jackson III, known as 50 Cent, has been granted permission to seize the Connecticut home of a former employee who confessed to embezzling from his Cognac and Champagne company, Sire Spirits. The rapper's company got the go-ahead from a federal judge to seize the home of former Sire executive Mitchell Green as partial payment toward a $7-million debt. Green had admitted to raising prices and receiving kickbacks from wholesalers labeled as "agency fees." While Jackson has not commented on the legal victory, he has been mocking Sean "Diddy" Combs, who is involved in a federal sex trafficking trial.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has halted the deportation of Eyidi Ambila, a Maine resident from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who claims he was illegally held by ICE for eight months. Judge John Woodcock issued an emergency ruling preventing the deportation after Ambila was moved to a jail in Massachusetts. Ambila's lawyers argued that ICE held him illegally without providing information about their plans and that the federal government has been unable to secure travel papers for him since 2007. The judge cited the lack of evidence that the DRC would accept Ambila and ordered the government to halt deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers in the UK are set to receive payouts of up to ¬£1,000 each, and may have debts written off, due to the scandal over the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are paying out more ¬£70m in compensation and financial support to customers. This follows a review by the regulator, Ofgem, of the way suppliers switched often vulnerable customers to paying upfront, without their agreement, after they fell behind with their bills. Eligible customers could receive payments starting at ¬£40, rising to ¬£250 or ¬£500, depending on the way they were treated by their energy supplier, or where processes were not followed adequately.</p>
