          <p>New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel made comments that were interpreted as a slight against his predecessor, Bill Belichick, following Belichick's unsuccessful debut as head coach for the University of North Carolina's football team. After UNC's 48-14 loss, Vrabel was asked if building a college program takes time, to which he contrasted the situation with Urban Meyer's immediate 12-0 record at Ohio State. Vrabel, who coached under Meyer, later qualified his remarks by acknowledging that the college football landscape has likely become more challenging.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's stock surged over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and reinstated its full-year guidance. The company credited its recent marketing campaigns, particularly a successful partnership with actress Sydney Sweeney, for driving customer acquisition and positive sales trends at the start of the fall season. Despite some controversy, the campaigns have led to increased brand engagement and sellouts of key products, signaling a potential turnaround after previous merchandising and tariff-related challenges.

          <p>Gold prices surged to a new record high of around $3,549 per ounce, representing a significant increase from approximately $2,500 a year ago. This rally has boosted the value of physical gold, such as the one-ounce bars sold by Costco, which were purchased for about $2,679 in September 2024. Investors are reportedly turning to gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty, ongoing wars, and inflation concerns. However, those looking to sell should be aware that profits will be reduced by dealer fees and federal taxes on collectibles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, a type of ankylosaur that lived over 165 million years ago and featured an unprecedentedly elaborate set of body armor. The dinosaur, roughly the size of a small car, possessed three-foot-long neck spikes, large spikes over its hips, and ribs fused with outward-projecting barbs—a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these dinosaurs developed complex armor for display and defense much earlier than previously believed.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced whole genome sequencing can be used as evidence in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer, setting a new legal precedent for the state. Prosecutors utilized this cutting-edge technique to link DNA from degraded, rootless hair strands found with victims to Heuermann and his family members. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the method is unreliable and the testing lab is not licensed in New York, but the decision is seen as a major victory for the prosecution.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to an estimated $1.4 billion, analysis shows that a winner's take-home amount can vary significantly depending on their state of residence. While all winnings are subject to a 37% federal tax, states like California, Florida, and Texas impose no additional state income tax on lottery prizes. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. This data highlights the considerable financial impact of local tax laws on large lottery windfalls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion" as required by the law. The administration had invoked the obscure wartime statute to remove hundreds of individuals accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, though the government could still seek to remove the migrants under other legal authorities.</p>
