        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that 67% of newlyweds incur debt to finance their weddings, highlighting the financial pressures associated with these celebrations. While some consider wedding debt frivolous, experts argue that it can be "good debt" if it provides a return on investment, even if non-financial. Experts recommend using credit cards with 0% introductory offers or personal lines of credit to manage wedding expenses wisely. Regardless of the debt type, creating a repayment plan is crucial to avoid financial strain and ensure a strong financial foundation for the marriage.</p>

          <p>A new proposal in California would require local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to show their faces while conducting official business, potentially charging those who cover their faces with a misdemeanor. The bill, introduced by State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, seeks to boost transparency and public trust in law enforcement. It exempts the National Guard, troops, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The senators cited recent incidents of federal officers conducting raids with covered faces as a key motivator for the proposal.</p>

          <p>Eaton, a Club holding, is diversifying beyond its data center focus with the acquisition of aerospace and defense firm Ultra Precision Control Systems for $1.55 billion. The move aims to expand Eaton's presence in fast-growing end markets amid increasing global defense spending. Ultra PCS, which makes products like ejection systems and noise control for aircraft, is projected to generate $240 million in sales in 2025. This acquisition should help alleviate concerns about Eaton's overreliance on the AI data center trade and broaden Wall Street's perception of the stock, with the aerospace division described as "a very solid business that is really coming on."</p>

AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, and a full-server rack called Helios.

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 can yield substantial monthly payments, influenced by factors like gender, interest rates, and annuity structure. Monthly payouts for a $400,000 annuity can range from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, according to an analysis of Cannex data by Annuity.org. Higher interest rates create more attractive monthly payouts. The decision to invest in an annuity requires considering one's overall financial picture, retirement goals, health status, and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
