          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance following trade discussions with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa highlighted "frank and in-depth discussions" on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security, expressing hope for an agreement next month. While declining to comment on Nippon Steel Corp.'s acquisition plan of United States Steel Corp., Akazawa urged the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan. The meetings occurred after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump agreed to productive talks, with Ishiba reiterating Japan's unwavering stance against the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles is set to make a historic visit to Canada, becoming the first monarch to open Canada's Parliament in nearly 70 years, amid pressure from US President Donald Trump. The visit and speech from the throne, written on the advice of Canada's government, is expected to deliver a message of Canadian sovereignty. While balancing the UK's relationship with the US, King Charles is expected to express solidarity with Canada and affirm its independence. Experts believe this intervention could have a big impact, particularly on President Trump, who admires the monarchy.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed: Distorting the Legacy of Sarah Milgrim Would Be Another Tragedy</h2>

          <p>In a guest essay, Yasmina Asrarguis remembers Sarah Milgrim, a peace builder who was murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington. Asrarguis emphasizes that Milgrim‚Äôs legacy should not be co-opted by those who seek to weaponize her death for political gain on either side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Milgrim, who worked for the Israeli Embassy, was committed to a concept known as the ‚Äúthird narrative,‚Äù which focuses on shared humanity and the mutual right to dignity, safety, and peace for Jews and Muslims.</p>
