          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a dominant force in the artificial intelligence sector. The company has expanded beyond telecommunications into AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. Analysts note that U.S. sanctions inadvertently bolstered Huawei's status as a national champion, accelerating its development of a comprehensive AI ecosystem. The article highlights Huawei's resilience and innovation, which have enabled it to challenge established leaders in the global tech landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a potential safe-haven asset, particularly amid uncertainty surrounding traditional choices like the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. The currency's stability is attributed to Singapore's strong institutional framework, prudent fiscal policies, and unique monetary management system. However, its path to becoming a global standard is hindered by the relatively small size of its market and limited trading volume compared to established safe havens. While it may not replace the top-tier currencies soon, analysts believe the SGD is becoming a key option for diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The declining Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust-belt region, is gambling on a new airport to spur economic revival and enhance trade with Russia. Faced with a shrinking population and declining GDP, the city is investing 1.2 billion yuan in the Luobei Airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This infrastructure project is part of a broader strategy to reverse years of industrial decline and create new growth opportunities. Analysts view it as an attempt by a smaller city to seek a breakthrough by improving its connectivity and economic links.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the powerful Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape and is also a suspect in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. His extradition marks a significant moment in Ecuador's crackdown on organized crime, which has transformed the nation into a hub of violence. He is scheduled to appear in a U.S. federal court on Monday.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients and researchers report that the drugs, known for promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity, can also alleviate PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and hormonal imbalances. While larger clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits and establish treatment protocols, the initial results offer new hope for managing a condition with limited effective options.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Japan are moving forward with clinical trials for a revolutionary drug designed to regrow human teeth. The drug functions by suppressing the USAG-1 protein, which has been shown to inhibit tooth growth in animal studies. Following successful trials in mice and ferrets, the first human trial will involve 30 men missing at least one tooth. Researchers are hopeful that this groundbreaking treatment could become publicly available by 2030, offering a biological solution for tooth loss instead of relying on implants or dentures.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has confirmed it will launch a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers clashing with striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent trial against the miners collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, welcomed the news as a long-overdue step toward truth and justice for the affected mining communities.</p>
