        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the high cost of beauty maintenance is an "insidious force" in women's financial lives. She describes the recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel" that profits from insecurity and functions as a depreciating asset. The article details Tassin's perspective, suggesting that women are socialized to prioritize beauty as social capital and offers strategies for a "detox" to reclaim money, time, and energy.</p>

          <p>A woman's Reddit post went viral after she detailed a family conflict over breakfast duties for her sister's two young children. The sister, who moved in after a breakup, would sleep until 1 p.m., leaving the poster to feed the kids. After several days of the children complaining about her cooking and demanding different meals, the woman finally told them to ask their mother, sparking a confrontation. The online community largely sided with the poster for setting boundaries.</p>

          <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has hailed the beginning of a disarmament process by the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) as the end of a "painful chapter." The move follows a symbolic ceremony where PKK fighters in northern Iraq set their weapons on fire, answering a call from their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to end the four-decade conflict. While Erdogan celebrated the development, he insisted it was not the result of any negotiations or concessions from his government.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that while many students believe finance offers the best career prospects, other data shows that some humanities degrees may lead to better employment outcomes. According to the New York Fed, recent graduates with majors like art history and philosophy have lower unemployment rates than those with economics or computer science degrees. This trend is causing some major firms, such as BlackRock, to actively recruit liberal arts graduates for their creative thinking and soft skills.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the right-wing backlash against the new "Superman" film for being "superwoke" is largely overblown. While director James Gunn acknowledged the character's immigrant origins, the film itself is presented as a classic American story of assimilation and heartland values shaping a hero. The article contends that despite being an alien refugee, Superman's story has rarely delved into the complex politics of U.S. immigration, making the current culture war controversy surrounding the film feel misplaced.</p>
