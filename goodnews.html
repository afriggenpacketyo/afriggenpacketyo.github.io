          <p>Brentford has rejected an improved bid of £40 million from Newcastle for striker Yoane Wissa, deeming the offer below their valuation of the player. The proposed deal included a £35 million initial fee with an additional £5 million in add-ons. Wissa, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, has reportedly expressed his desire to join Newcastle and held talks with Brentford's owner. The rejection marks the second time Newcastle's offer for the 28-year-old forward has been turned down, leaving his future at the club uncertain as discussions continue.</p>

          <p>A recent financial analysis highlights the significant returns savers can achieve by investing in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current economic climate. Despite rates having cooled from their recent peaks, they remain high enough to generate substantial interest on a large deposit like $125,000. The article breaks down the expected earnings across various terms, from a 3-month CD yielding over $1,300 to a 5-year CD generating nearly $30,000 in interest. This positions CDs as a secure and predictable investment option for those seeking stable growth amidst market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lowe's reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by increased demand for smaller home projects. Concurrently, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion, a strategic move to strengthen its business with home professionals. While sales to DIY customers showed solid performance, CEO Marvin Ellison noted that demand for larger projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates. The acquisition is part of Lowe's strategy to position itself for growth when the housing market eventually becomes more active.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's finance chief, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, signaling rapid growth since the launch of ChatGPT. Despite this financial milestone, Friar emphasized that the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for GPUs and processing power to train and run its advanced AI models. This high demand is driving OpenAI to pursue massive datacenter projects and diversify its infrastructure partners beyond Microsoft. The company's annual recurring revenue has now reached $10 billion, with expectations for continued aggressive spending to meet future needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a "superfood" supplement designed to protect honeybees from threats like climate change and habitat loss. The new food provides all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, particularly lipids called sterols, which have been difficult to manufacture until now. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement produced up to 15 times more offspring that reached adulthood. This breakthrough could be crucial for supporting global honeybee populations, which are vital for pollinating a majority of the world's leading crops and are currently facing severe declines.</p>

          <h2>GE Vernova Invests $41 Million to Expand Generator Manufacturing for AI-Driven Energy Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:56:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GE Vernova is investing at least $41 million in its Schenectady, New York, facility to expand its generator manufacturing capacity. This move aims to meet the surging demand for electricity, largely driven by the energy-intensive needs of AI data centers. The investment will improve the production of generators that are paired with the company's heavy-duty gas turbines, which are reportedly sold out for the next several years. This expansion addresses the critical need for more power-generating capacity and positions GE Vernova to capitalize on the ongoing AI infrastructure boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest figure in the survey's nearly 90-year history. This decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of adults now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to their health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. The trend is most pronounced among young adults, who are increasingly viewing alcohol as a health risk. This change reflects growing awareness of scientific evidence linking alcohol consumption to negative health outcomes, including cancer.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Impact of Federal Reserve Rate Cuts on HELOC Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:37:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could lead to lower monthly payments. Since HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a cut in the federal funds rate usually results in a corresponding drop in the HELOC rate. However, the timing of payment relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule and the loan's billing cycle. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan terms and budget for potential rate fluctuations in either direction to manage their debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
