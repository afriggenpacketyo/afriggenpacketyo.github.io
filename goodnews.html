          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts but slowing from the previous quarter's pace. While the growth keeps China on track for its annual 5% target, underlying weaknesses persist, including a slowdown in retail sales and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Amid these challenges and growing deflationary pressures, there are increasing calls for the government to implement further stimulus measures to support domestic consumption and stabilize the economy.

          <p>SiriusXM is launching its first ad-supported subscription plan for in-car listening, a strategic shift for the traditionally commercial-free audio company. The new, cheaper tier is designed to convert customers who do not subscribe after their free trials expire and to compete with other streaming options. This move mirrors strategies used by companies like Netflix to drive revenue and subscriber growth in a competitive market, with the company betting that a lower price point will expand its customer base.</p>

          <p>A review of Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," explores its unique approach to autobiographical storytelling. The article praises the work for embracing the gaps and absences in memory, framing personal history as a conversation between recollection and forgetting. By classifying the deeply personal story as a novel, Ullmann challenges the boundaries between fact and fiction, suggesting that all autobiography is a form of novelization shaped by the unreliable nature of the human mind.</p>
