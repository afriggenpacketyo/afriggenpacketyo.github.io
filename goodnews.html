        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, signaling a shift in global investment dynamics. Analysts suggest investors are moving away from U.S. dollar assets due to President Trump's trade war. Bank of America analysts noted that China's economic recovery and weaker U.S. dollar are favoring emerging markets, contributing to the capital inflow.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, saw its shares jump over 10% in its Hong Kong Stock Exchange debut, marking the biggest IPO of the year. The company, which supplies major carmakers like Tesla and Toyota, raised almost HK$35.7bn ($4.55bn) from the listing, with funds earmarked for building a factory in Hungary. Despite U.S. lawmakers' concerns over potential national security risks, CATL is investing heavily in new technology, including fast-charging batteries. Tim Buckley says the US should be looking to work with Beijing on the advancement of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose as much as 14% during their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday, with the IPO raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion). The company plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. CATL's global expansion coincides with similar moves by other Chinese EV makers, though these efforts have faced challenges due to U.S. and EU tariffs on Chinese EVs. Despite a revenue drop in 2024, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump as the president of the Kennedy Center, alleges that the center's financial reports contain "criminal" debt and deferred maintenance, claiming to have found $26 million in "phantom revenue." Grenell intends to refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney's office. Kennedy Center officials attribute the deficit figures to a review by the new chief financial officer, while a spokesman for former chairman David M. Rubenstein defends the center's previous management, stating that financial reports were reviewed and approved by the audit committee, the full board, and a major accounting firm. The upcoming season will feature both union and nonunion casts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will commission JAMSTEC, Eneos Corp., and others to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess environmental impact. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon. The move comes as Japan seeks to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, with forests' CO2 absorption capacity declining due to aging trees.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to shore up its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate was reduced to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. Zichun Huang from Capital Economics forecasts further lending rate cuts by year-end, while Allan von Mehren from Denske Bank revised the 12-month target for the offshore yuan to 7.15 from 7.35.</p>
