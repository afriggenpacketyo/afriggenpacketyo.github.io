          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against a blogger who accused him of being a Kremlin asset and planning the January 6 Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas awarded $250,000 in damages after the defendant, Jim Stewartson, failed to respond to the lawsuit. The judge determined that Stewartson acted with malice, stating that while criticism of public figures is protected, defamatory falsehoods are not. Stewartson claimed he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described it as a frivolous attempt to intimidate him.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged in the second quarter, rising from 23% to 31%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is largely attributed to Samsung's innovation in foldable screen technology with its Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, its lack of a foldable option has created an opening for Samsung to capture consumer interest. Analysts expect Apple to respond with a slimmer iPhone model soon and potentially its own foldable device by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a coalition of European leaders issued a strong statement of support for Ukraine. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Finland, along with EU institutions, insisted that Russia cannot have a veto over Ukraine's future membership in NATO or the EU. They also pledged to continue strengthening sanctions and economic pressure on Russia's war economy until a just and lasting peace is achieved. The statement signals a unified European effort to manage the diplomatic fallout from the bilateral U.S.-Russia meeting.</p>

Chambers, who began her Parkrun journey in 2016 at the age of 88, has become a local legend and an inspiration to her community. Despite her age and recent health challenges, she remains determined, stating that if she sets a goal, she tries to achieve it.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American archaeology student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her first-ever excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, about 1.5 inches long with a decorative finial, was found near the route of a major Roman road. Experts believe the high-status object, likely used by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes, may have been part of a pair with a similar item found in 2021. The discovery provides a valuable glimpse into the early medieval period in northeastern England, long after the fall of the Roman Empire.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its homicide rate falling to a 50-year low. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that treats violence as a public health issue. The city's program focuses on identifying the small number of individuals at the highest risk of being perpetrators or victims of gun violence and proactively offering them intensive support, including housing, job training, and mental health services. Law enforcement acts as a backstop for those who refuse help, creating a "carrot and stick" approach that has proven remarkably effective, though it now faces threats from federal funding cuts.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Advise Saving for Retirement Earlier Than Most Americans Think Ideal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a recent survey suggests Americans believe 27 is the ideal age to begin saving for retirement, financial advisors strongly recommend starting much earlier. Experts emphasize the significant advantage of compound interest, where money earned on an initial investment begins to earn its own returns over time. Starting to save even in one's early 20s allows decades for this compounding effect to work, potentially leading to a dramatically larger nest egg by retirement age. The article highlights that delaying savings, even by a few years, can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars less in retirement funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are facing homelessness for the first time in their lives due to rising housing costs and economic instability. In response, healthcare organizations like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, are increasingly getting involved in securing housing for their clients. Recognizing that stable housing is essential for health, these groups are partnering with developers and even purchasing their own properties. This trend highlights a national crisis that experts call a "scandal," as the number of destitute elderly and disabled individuals continues to grow.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research conducted on wild chimpanzees in Uganda has revealed that their complex communication, which combines vocalizations and gestures, is primarily learned from their mothers and maternal relatives. The study, published in PLOS Biology, found that young chimps develop communication styles similar to their mothers but not their fathers. This suggests that these behaviors are socially transmitted rather than purely genetic, as offspring spend their early years in close contact with their maternal line. The findings imply that the capacity for socially learned communication is an ancient trait shared by both chimpanzees and humans.</p>

The bear, tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, gained notoriety for crossing multiple major freeways and navigating urban areas. Her decision to den and raise cubs in the area has generated excitement and some concern among local residents.

          <p>California has approved a groundbreaking conservation plan aimed at protecting the western Joshua tree from the long-term threats of climate change and development. The plan identifies key habitats where the species might thrive in a warmer future and introduces regulations to protect them. While environmentalists have lauded the forward-thinking approach, the law has sparked controversy among some high desert residents and officials. They argue that the new permit and fee requirements for removing or damaging the currently abundant trees will stifle necessary housing and infrastructure projects in one of Southern California's last affordable regions.</p>

The hotline operates on the principle that peer-to-peer support can be uniquely effective, as teen volunteers can often better understand and validate the struggles of callers.
