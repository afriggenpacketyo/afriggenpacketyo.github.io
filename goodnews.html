          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates currently offer higher returns than the inflation rate, making them an attractive savings option. As of August 1, 2025, top 6-month CDs can yield up to 4.45% APY, significantly higher than the national average. Experts recommend considering online banks for better rates due to lower overheads and exploring short-term CDs, given the inverted yield curve where shorter terms often offer higher returns. Laddering CDs can also help investors capitalize on these rates while planning for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have seen significant asset growth, topping $13.74 trillion, attracting investors with lower costs and tax advantages compared to mutual funds. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of a clear ETF investment strategy to navigate market fluctuations. Key recommendations include avoiding trading during market open and close due to high volatility, favoring the less 'frothy' middle hours. Additionally, instead of attempting to time the market, which is often ineffective, investors are advised to use dollar-cost averaging and consider limit orders for more controlled purchases.

          <p>Cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew praised the England vs India Test series as the best since the 2005 Ashes, citing its intensity, combative nature, and immense skill. The series, which saw a record 7,187 runs scored and every game reaching the final day, delivered compelling drama. Agnew emphasized that such competitive five-day matches are vital for Test cricket's appeal, asserting that administrators considering four-day Tests should reconsider. The final moments, including Chris Woakes' hobbling appearance, underscored the pure drama of the match.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill" introduces a temporary $40,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which phases out for modified adjusted gross incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. This creates a "SALT torpedo" with an artificial 45.5% federal tax rate for high earners in that income bracket. Experts advise managing unexpected income and utilizing tax breaks, such as switching to pretax 401(k) contributions, to keep earnings below these thresholds. Strategic financial planning is crucial to navigate these changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of UK car finance customers could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions paid by lenders to dealers. The Financial Conduct Authority is establishing a compensation scheme, with first payments expected in 2026.

Consumer groups advise against using claims companies, suggesting individuals write directly to their lenders to inquire about their case and establish facts. (not investment advice)</p>

Rising costs and the lack of a permanent location force price hikes, making it difficult for some families to afford.

Her father, a former writer for Jim Henson, had a deep connection to the Muppets, including contributing to the Swedish Chef's accent. Watching the show with her children created a "cocoon" of nonsensical 1970s humor, offering an antidote to dread and logistical burdens. The experience allowed her to reconnect with forgotten childhood memories and her father's playful spirit, illustrating how art can provide solace and connection during profound loss.</p>
