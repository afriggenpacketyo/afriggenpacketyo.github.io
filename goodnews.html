          <p>As it turns twenty, Reddit is navigating the threat posed by artificial intelligence, which scrapes its vast user-generated content for training models. The company is actively defending its data, highlighted by a recent lawsuit against AI firm Anthropic for alleged unlawful data scraping. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging AI for its own benefit, launching "Reddit Answers," a tool that generates responses based solely on Reddit conversations and directs users to the original discussions. This dual strategy aims to protect the value of its unique human-generated content while adapting to the new technological landscape and enhancing user experience.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited Kyiv, declaring that supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia is the most critical task of Germany's foreign and security policy. Amid intensified Russian bombardments, Wadephul pledged continued military, humanitarian, and economic aid, emphasizing that Russian President Putin seeks capitulation, not negotiation. While Germany remains a top supporter, it still withholds long-range Taurus missiles, instead planning to help Ukraine develop its own independent long-range capabilities. The visit underscores Germany's commitment as European allies work to compensate for uncertain U.S. support.</p>

The resurgence is attributed to increased participation from international investors, significant capital inflows from mainland China, and strong post-listing performance for newly offered stocks.

          <p>This opinion article posits that the second Trump administration is successfully implementing a grand strategy centered on American interests, characterized as "peace through strength." The author argues that this approach has created new opportunities for commerce in regions like the Middle East while isolating Iran, contrary to critics who claim it causes chaos. The piece cites strategic strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as evidence of this doctrine, asserting they served both to support allies like Israel and to demonstrate that diplomacy is preferred, with force being a last resort to bring parties to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>An alliance of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to rebuild support and drive voter engagement following the party's losses in the 2024 elections. With an initial six-figure investment, the program aims to mobilize thousands of volunteers to connect with voters in non-political settings and provide direct feedback to inform party strategy. This effort comes as the party seeks to unify after recent internal disputes and prepare for crucial 2026 midterm elections, focusing on key House districts and gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey.</p>

          <p>Homicide rates across the United States are falling significantly, with a drop of at least 14% in 2024, marking a sharp reversal from the surge seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Crime analysts suggest the primary driver for both the rise and fall of violence was the pandemic's disruption of daily life and social services. As public services, community programs, and local government employment return to pre-pandemic levels, support systems for at-risk youth are being restored. This, combined with community violence intervention programs, is credited with helping to interrupt cycles of violence and reduce murders nationwide.</p>

          <p>Canada has withdrawn its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms just hours before it was set to take effect, paving the way for trade talks with the United States to resume. The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump called the tax a "blatant attack" and halted negotiations, threatening higher tariffs on Canadian imports. The proposed 3% levy would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. Canadian officials stated their preference has always been a multilateral agreement and that the tax was rescinded to advance a comprehensive trade deal.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada has formally acknowledged the Indian origins of a new sandal design following accusations of cultural appropriation. The footwear, which closely resembles traditional Kolhapuri sandals from Maharashtra, was showcased at Milan Fashion Week without crediting its roots, sparking backlash in India. In response, Prada stated it is now in contact with an Indian industry body and is open to dialogue with local artisans. Kolhapuri sandals, which trace their history to the 12th century, were granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag by the Indian government in 2019.</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, a prominent Belarusian opposition blogger and one of the country's most well-known political prisoners, has been freed and is now in exile after more than five years in detention. His release, along with 13 others, followed a rare visit to Minsk by a senior U.S. delegation. Tikhanovsky, who was held in solitary confinement and lost significant weight, described the harsh conditions but stated his spirit is unbroken. His wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who ran for president in his place in 2020, expressed wariness about the diplomatic engagement that led to his release.</p>
