          <p>Manchester United has secured a deal to acquire 22-year-old Slovenian forward Benjamin Sesko from Red Bull Leipzig for a reported £73.7 million. The agreement includes a substantial guaranteed payment with additional performance-based add-ons. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle, will finalize his move to Old Trafford after completing a medical. This signing is part of a broader offensive overhaul for the club, which has already spent significantly on new forwards this summer and is reportedly open to selling existing players like Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International (RBI) announced mixed financial results for its second quarter, with revenues surpassing expectations but earnings per share falling short. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and growth at Tim Hortons, which offset a 1.4% decline in same-store sales at Popeyes. Burger King showed modest growth, particularly in the U.S. as its turnaround efforts continue. RBI executives noted a slight improvement in the consumer environment and reiterated their full-year forecast, signaling a focus on innovation at Popeyes to counter increased competition.

This move is seen as a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for access to the trillions of dollars held in American defined-contribution retirement accounts. While these assets have been traditionally excluded from 401(k)s due to higher risks, fees, and lack of transparency, the order signals a major potential shift in retirement investment strategy.

          <p>Archaeologists at Pompeii have uncovered new evidence showing that survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to the devastated city. These individuals, likely unable to afford relocating, established an informal and precarious settlement amidst the ruins. The findings indicate that former ground floors of buildings were repurposed into cellars with ovens, suggesting a community living in difficult conditions. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event, revealing a previously overlooked chapter of resilience and survival in the ancient city's history.</p>

          <p>The NFL has clarified its new policy regarding ammonia inhalants, commonly known as smelling salts, after initial reports of a total ban caused an outcry from players like George Kittle. The NFL Players Association confirmed that the rule only prohibits teams from providing the substances, but players are still permitted to use their own. The league's concern, based on FDA warnings, is that the inhalants could mask concussion symptoms. However, players argue the stimulants are used for energy, and the new policy is seen by some as a convoluted attempt by the league to reduce its liability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is releasing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2026-27 academic year ahead of schedule, with beta testing already underway. This earlier launch is expected to provide more time to identify and fix technical issues that plagued the form's rollout last year, which saw delays and complications. Financial aid experts have welcomed the move, as an earlier and smoother application process is crucial for students. Timely FAFSA submission is a key predictor of college enrollment and helps families access essential aid, including grants, loans, and work-study programs.</p>

The mission was conducted in complete winter darkness and sub-zero temperatures, requiring the crew to use night vision goggles to land a C-130 Hercules on a specially prepared ice runway. The U.S. National Science Foundation, which operates the base, requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources on-site.

          <p>Eli Lilly significantly raised its full-year 2025 guidance after reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The pharmaceutical giant's strong performance was driven by soaring demand for its diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss treatment Zepbound, which generated nearly $5.2 billion and $3.38 billion in revenue, respectively. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for 2025. This positive earnings report was somewhat overshadowed by disappointing trial results for a new experimental obesity pill, which caused the company's shares to fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs currently offer more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early August 2025, average rates for fixed-rate home equity loans hover around 8.3-8.4%, while the average variable HELOC rate is about 8.26%. These products allow homeowners to tap into their property's value, but it's crucial to understand the differences between them and the associated risks. Since the home serves as collateral, homeowners should carefully compare offers from various lenders to secure the best possible terms. (not investment advice)</p>

While the company hailed the result as strong for an oral agent, the data fell short of some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's shares to drop significantly. Some doctors noted that while the pill offers a convenient, needle-free alternative, the level of weight loss was slightly lower than existing injections like Wegovy. The trial also saw about 10% of patients on the highest dose discontinue treatment due to side effects. (not investment advice)</p>
