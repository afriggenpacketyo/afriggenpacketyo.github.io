          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal grant money from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. These policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling protects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants that the administration sought to deny as part of a broader effort to compel local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration actions. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities across the nation.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. The article highlights the story of Tommy Fello, a restaurateur who had lost movement in his left side after a stroke and saw minimal improvement with traditional therapy. After receiving the implant at the Cleveland Clinic, he has made significant progress in regaining hand and arm function, demonstrating the potential of this first-of-its-kind technology to redefine recovery possibilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the great wealth transfer continues, families face challenges in passing down an estimated $25 trillion in real estate without incurring significant taxes or causing internal conflict. Financial advisors recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death, rather than as a lifetime gift, to take advantage of a "step-up in basis" that minimizes capital gains taxes for heirs. To protect the asset from lawsuits and disputes, experts suggest placing the home in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) and creating an operating agreement that outlines usage rules and buyout provisions. Setting aside liquid assets for upkeep is also crucial to prevent the property from becoming a financial burden. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest season of the animated show "South Park" has taken a direct and unrestrained critical aim at the Trump administration, featuring scathing parodies of the president and his cabinet members. This bold approach comes at a sensitive time for its parent company, Paramount, which has been under scrutiny from the administration following a legal settlement. Despite potential corporate pressure, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are leveraging their creative freedom, which is backed by a lucrative new streaming deal worth over a billion dollars. The show's high ratings suggest that its sharp political satire is resonating strongly with audiences, making it more relevant than ever.</p>

These changes signal that management is actively working to professionalize its processes for long-term growth, a strategy supported by Elliott to enhance shareholder value.

          <h2>Florida Communities Adapt and Rebuild for a Future of Stronger Storms</h2>

          <p>In the wake of devastating hurricanes like Ian, Florida is grappling with how to rebuild for a more resilient future against climate-driven storms. Some residents are choosing to relocate inland to higher ground, moving to meticulously planned communities like Babcock Ranch, which is designed with storm-proof features. Others with deep community roots are staying put, relying on city and nonprofit programs to rebuild their homes at higher elevations with hurricane-resistant materials. However, with federal support for mitigation measures declining, there is a growing struggle to fund these crucial, though costly, preventative projects, despite their proven long-term economic benefits.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger, social-media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents in Congress. These challengers argue that the party's aging establishment has grown complacent and out of touch, failing to respond with sufficient urgency to the threats posed by the Trump administration. Citing a need for new energy and a different approach to connect with voters, they are no longer willing to wait their turn for leadership positions. This trend reflects a broader demand for generational change within the Democratic party, sparking internal debates about its future direction and strategy.</p>

          <p>Decades after his education was cut short by horrific abuse, a 75-year-old man has finally received his high school diploma. Eddie Horne was a student at the notoriously brutal Dozier School for Boys in the 1960s, where he endured vicious beatings that led him to drop out of school to support his family. He fulfilled his lifelong goal through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of the now-closed reform school. His graduation from St. Petersburg High School represents a story of profound resilience and serves as an inspiration for overcoming severe adversity.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologists Highlight Tinted Sunscreen's Unique Protection Against Visible Light</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While standard sunscreen protects against UV radiation, dermatologists are emphasizing that it does not block visible light, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, especially in people with darker skin. Tinted sunscreens, which contain iron oxides, offer this crucial protection by blocking visible light rays that penetrate the skin more deeply than UV. This can help prevent the formation of dark spots that often result from skin inflammation like acne. As awareness of this issue grows, experts are calling for more research and a wider range of product tints to make this form of sun protection more accessible and effective for all skin tones.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruptive activity, sending fountains of lava shooting up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This latest display is part of an ongoing eruption that began in December and has been characterized by frequent, dramatic episodes of molten rock. The eruption is currently contained within Halemaumau Crater and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular and accessible show for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are closely monitoring the activity, which provides valuable insights into the volcano's complex underground magma system.</p>

          <p>Following recent devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, residents are taking soil cleanup into their own hands due to concerns about contamination from burned structures. With government agencies not providing widespread soil testing, community workshops are teaching DIY bioremediation techniques to detoxify yards. These methods use natural materials like specific plants, fungi, and biochar to trap or break down contaminants such as heavy metals and dioxins. This grassroots effort reflects a growing awareness of soil health and provides a sense of empowerment for residents worried about the safety of their gardens and the potential health risks for their families.</p>
