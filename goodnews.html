          <h2>Psychologist Warns Against Using Comparison in Relationships</h2>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [other person]?" as particularly damaging to relationships. The article explains that such comparisons lead to insecurity and feelings of inadequacy in the recipient, who may start questioning their worth. The root cause is often a fear of openly communicating needs, leading to bottled-up frustrations that eventually erupt in harmful comparisons. The psychologist suggests that partners should focus on clear and direct communication of their needs to foster a secure and emotionally close relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has refuted rumors that he is considering running for a third presidential term, which is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. In an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press," Trump stated that despite receiving numerous requests to do so, he is not pursuing another term. He mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors. Trump also defended his handling of the economy, despite recent economic contraction, attributing any issues to his predecessor and claiming the U.S. will soon have the greatest economy in its history.</p>

          <p>The article critiques media reports portraying American workers as universally disengaged and unhappy, arguing that many of these narratives are driven by surveys conducted by HR firms and media outlets with their own agendas. The author suggests that these surveys often lack scientific rigor and overemphasize negative aspects of work. The article posits that while job dissatisfaction can be a motivator for improvement, many people are content with their jobs and understand the pressures employers face. The author encourages readers to take such reports with a grain of salt and focus on personal solutions to job dissatisfaction.</p>

In contrast, Vanya suggests a different perspective, where the expression of many selves can be a form of liberation.</p>
