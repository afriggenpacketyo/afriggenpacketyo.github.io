          <p>The White House announced that it has reached a trade deal with China after two days of negotiations in Switzerland, although China referred to the agreement as a 'consensus.' U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer expressed confidence that the deal would help resolve the national emergency, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted 'substantial progress' without confirming a full agreement. The article highlights that China has yet to comment directly on the deal and that this development follows President Trump's announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom. The agreement aims to de-escalate trade tensions that have caused economic uncertainty and warnings of price increases for U.S. consumers.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Switzerland have developed a 'digital bridge' that wirelessly connects the brain to the spinal cord, helping paralyzed individuals regain movement and bodily functions. The article details how the technology, developed by French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, bypasses spinal cord injuries to restore communication between the brain and limbs. CEO of Onward Medical, Dave Marver, explains that patients prioritize regaining functions like bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation over walking. The system has also shown promise in Parkinson's disease patients, improving their mobility by stimulating the spinal cord. The scientists are now focused on conducting clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy for wider accessibility.</p>

The article explains that the statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea. The statue's return follows a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, after Buseoksa Temple claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The artifact is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>

Now, for the first time since 2008, the group is on the road playing shows again. The timing makes sense, given that Lewis over the intervening years has become something of an older-sister figure for a subsequent generation or two of smart young musicians writing about all the ways the world can disappoint a woman in her 20s.</p>
