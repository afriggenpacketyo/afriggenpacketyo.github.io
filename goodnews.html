          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the Karen Read case, from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022, to her recent acquittal on the most serious charges. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die, but her defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case involved two lengthy trials, with the first ending in a hung jury and a mistrial. The timeline covers key events, evidence, witness testimonies, and the significant legal and public fallout, culminating in a not-guilty verdict for murder.</p>

          <p>LeBron James has exercised his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season. This decision will make him the first player in NBA history to play for 23 seasons, surpassing his tie with Vince Carter. At 40 years old, James is also approaching Robert Parish's record for the most regular-season games played. The move solidifies a key piece of the Lakers' roster as they navigate the offseason, having recently seen Dorian Finney-Smith decline his option to enter free agency while still seeking to fill out the team around its star.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul explained his support for the Senate's Republican-led budget bill, citing its provisions for border security, defense spending, and tax cut extensions. Despite concerns from some fiscal conservatives about the bill's impact on the deficit and Medicaid, McCaul argued it is essential for national security, especially in light of recent events involving Iran. He also discussed the aftermath of the U.S. strikes on Iran, expressing confidence in the intelligence assessment that the program was set back for years. McCaul asserted that the deterrence is real and that the world is safer as a result of the military operation.</p>

          <p>The Brad Pitt-led racing film "F1 The Movie" has become Apple's biggest box office success to date, debuting with $55.6 million in the U.S. and Canada. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, the film exceeded analyst expectations and garnered an additional $88 million internationally, driven by the global popularity of Formula One. Despite its strong opening and positive audience scores, the movie's high budget of over $200 million means it still has a long road to profitability. The release, handled by Warner Bros., marks a significant theatrical achievement for Apple, whose previous high-profile films have struggled to find similar box office success.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured his third victory of the season at the Austrian Grand Prix, holding off a persistent challenge from his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri. The one-two finish for McLaren narrows the championship gap between the two drivers to just 15 points. The race was dominated by the McLaren duo, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing a distant third. The event was disastrous for Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who was knocked out of the race on the first lap after a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli. Antonelli apologized for the incident but received a three-place grid penalty for the upcoming British Grand Prix.</p>

She later joked with the crowd, "If ever I fall, I know y'all will catch me." Her production company confirmed a "technical mishap" was the cause and that no one was injured during the incident.</p>

          <p>Automaker Lotus has reassured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, following an urgent meeting on Sunday. The discussion was prompted by reports that the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, a move that would risk 1,300 jobs. Lotus had previously paused production due to a 25% U.S. tariff on car imports. The UK government stated it was reassured by management's commitment to its UK operations, and Lotus insisted that Britain remains the heart of its brand, even as it explores strategic options for global competitiveness.</p>
