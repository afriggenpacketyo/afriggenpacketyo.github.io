This significant result highlights Verstappen's persistent challenge for the championship, despite a substantial points gap, following a recent resurgence by his Red Bull team. Drivers reported difficult conditions, including strong gusty winds and a very bumpy track, which tested their control and precision. The qualifying also featured a standout performance from Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who achieved a sensational fourth place, indicating a potentially thrilling and unpredictable sprint event.</p>

          <p>A viral phrase, "six, seven," derived from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," is causing widespread, playful disruption in classrooms and among teens. Despite the rapper stating he never assigned an actual meaning, the term has become a pervasive, seemingly random inside joke, prompting spontaneous shouts and laughter. Educators are reacting differently, with some schools banning the phrase due to classroom disruptions, while others attempt to embrace or simply endure the trend. Social media has amplified its reach, and experts suggest its unusual longevity is partly fueled by the enjoyment children derive from a secret code that playfully frustrates adults.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce, publicly apologized for his previous comments supporting President Trump's suggestion to deploy National Guard troops to San Francisco to combat crime. Benioff stated that after listening to local officials and residents, he no longer believes the National Guard is needed, clarifying his earlier remarks stemmed from "an abundance of caution" regarding his company's Dreamforce conference. His initial support for federal intervention sparked widespread criticism, particularly given his past advocacy for liberal policies and wealth redistribution. City and state leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have countered Trump's claims with data showing significant drops in homicides and robberies, asserting local authorities have the crime issue under control.</p>

          <h2>California Labor Leader's Charge Reduced to Misdemeanor After ICE Protest Arrest</h2>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have reduced the charge against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, from a felony to a misdemeanor for "obstruction resistance or opposition of a federal officer." Huerta was arrested during an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June 2025, accused of actively impeding federal authorities from serving a search warrant. His attorneys maintain that Huerta was exercising his First Amendment rights to observe and document law enforcement activity, arguing he is being targeted for his role as a prominent critic of the administration's immigration policies. This reduction follows recent acquittals in similar misdemeanor trials, underscoring the legal complexities and ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and protest rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exciting new trial results from North America indicate that the Galleri blood test, developed by American firm Grail, successfully detected over 50 types of cancer, with a significant three-quarters of these lacking any current screening programs. The test, which identifies cancerous DNA fragments circulating in the blood, demonstrated high accuracy, correctly ruling out cancer in over 99% of negative results. Over half of the cancers identified were at an early stage, when treatment is typically most effective. While these impressive findings suggest a major role for earlier cancer diagnosis, researchers caution that more evidence from large-scale studies, such as the ongoing NHS trial, is required to definitively prove a reduction in cancer mortality.</p>

          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley semiconductor company, has unexpectedly become a central player in the booming artificial intelligence infrastructure market with its distinctive purple active electrical cables (AECs). These specialized cables, costing between $300 and $500 each, are vital for interconnecting the numerous GPUs in massive AI supercomputing facilities, as evidenced by Elon Musk's xAI data center. Credo's stock has more than doubled this year, reflecting Wall Street's growing recognition of its crucial role. Analysts forecast the AEC market to reach $4 billion by 2028, with Credo commanding an estimated 88% market share due to the enhanced reliability of its cables in preventing expensive data center outages compared to fiber optics.

          <p>Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis project should evolve beyond its current design as a new town addressing housing and industrial needs, instead becoming a pivotal zone for cultural emancipation within the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The article posits that given the GBA's already sophisticated technological and network infrastructure, the next crucial competition will be in cultural influence, similar to global phenomena like Hollywood or K-pop. Consequently, the metropolis must strategically pivot its development from a property-driven model to one that prioritizes innovation and the creation of cultural content. This reorientation could establish Hong Kong as a global hub for cultural output.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk experienced declines after President Trump publicly stated his administration's intention to cut the monthly cost of brand-name GLP-1 weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic, to $150. This proposed price represents a substantial reduction from their current market prices, which can exceed $1,300 in the US, contrasting sharply with international rates. Although Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz clarified that negotiations with drugmakers for GLP-1s are still underway and not yet finalized, Trump's announcement significantly impacted pharmaceutical stock performance. The initiative aligns with Trump's "most-favored nation" pricing policy, aiming to standardize US drug costs with those in other developed countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints ascended to the top of the Prem table with a convincing 36-19 victory against Newcastle Red Bulls, who are still seeking their first league win of the season. Saints secured a five-try bonus point, an impressive feat given they spent half an hour of the match with a man disadvantage due to JJ van der Mescht receiving two yellow cards. Despite Newcastle drawing within two points twice during these periods, they ultimately failed to fully capitalize. This defeat prolongs Newcastle's league victory drought, which dates back to November of the previous year, while Northampton continues its strong, unbeaten run in the competition.</p>

          <p>Boeing has secured approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, marking a significant milestone almost two years after a near-catastrophic midair accident. The FAA had previously restricted Boeing's output to 38 planes monthly following a January 2024 incident where a door plug detached from an Alaska Airlines flight, later found to be due to uninstalled bolts. The FAA confirmed extensive safety reviews were conducted to ensure the production rate increase is safe, while Boeing reiterated its commitment to safety and quality. This approval, coupled with other recent regulatory concessions, indicates a renewed, albeit cautious, confidence in Boeing's manufacturing integrity after years of scrutiny.</p>
