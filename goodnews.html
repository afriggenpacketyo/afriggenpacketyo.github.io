          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, is contributing $22 million towards the construction of the White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with Donald Trump following his ban from YouTube after the January 6th Capitol riot. This contribution represents almost 10% of the estimated $250 million construction costs. While Trump has promised that taxpayers will not foot the bill, questions remain about the full list of donors and the exact amounts they have pledged. The Treasury Department has restricted its staff from sharing photos of the East Wing demolition due to security concerns, and the White House has dismissed criticism as "manufactured outrage."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electricity prices are increasing dramatically, driven in part by the growing demand from AI data centers. Tech companies are shopping for power from multiple utilities, potentially leading to double counting of energy needs and infrastructure overbuilding. This speculation could result in regular customers bearing the financial burden of unused infrastructure. While electricity prices are expected to rise in the near term, consumers may save money on household energy over time by switching from fossil fuels to electricity, particularly with electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Storm Benjamin, named by Météo France, is expected to bring wet and windy weather to the United Kingdom. While the most severe impacts will be felt across France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the UK could experience heavy rain leading to localized flooding and strong winds causing travel disruption. The Met Office has issued yellow severe weather warnings for both wind and rain. There is a small chance of gusts up to 75mph along the North Sea coast, which could topple trees, disrupt travel, and cause power cuts.</p>

          <p>An Ohio lawmaker has introduced a bill to prevent AI systems from being treated as people, including a ban on marrying AI. The bill aims to label AI as "nonsentient entities," preventing them from owning property, managing bank accounts, or holding corporate positions. The legislation also specifies that human owners or developers are responsible if an AI causes harm. The proposal is driven by concerns about the increasing emotional attachment people are forming with AI and the need to maintain human control.</p>
