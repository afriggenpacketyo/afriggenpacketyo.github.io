          <p>Thailand is mourning the passing of its former Queen Sirikit, the esteemed mother of King Vajiralongkorn, who died peacefully at 93. As the wife of King Bhumibol Adulyadej for over six decades, she was a deeply revered figure, often regarded as the nation's maternal symbol, with her birthday observed as Mother's Day. King Vajiralongkorn has decreed a royal funeral, and the royal family will enter a year-long period of mourning. Queen Sirikit had been battling various illnesses since 2019 and had largely withdrawn from public life after suffering a stroke in 2012, concluding a profound chapter in Thai royal history.</p>

          <p>Principal Brianna Lanoye of Buffalo Academy of Science was surprised with a heartwarming mock wedding ceremony, orchestrated by her students and staff. Lanoye, who had often expressed a wish to invite the entire school to her actual wedding, was visibly emotional upon seeing over 400 students and staff gathered in the courtyard. A student officiated the proceedings, where she and her fiancé Zach Klapp exchanged vows and candy ring pops. This unique event not only celebrated her upcoming marriage but also profoundly demonstrated the deep affection and strong community bond between the principal and her students, making it a truly memorable occasion for everyone involved.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured the fastest time in Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, though he voiced concerns about his long-run pace despite a strong single-lap performance. McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who are currently under pressure from Verstappen, struggled during the session, with Norris acknowledging the team was "a little bit behind" and experiencing balance problems. Piastri finished significantly lower in 12th place. This practice session indicates a potentially challenging weekend for McLaren, while Red Bull focuses on optimizing its race strategy, recognizing that single-lap speed alone will not guarantee victory.</p>

          <h2>Mysterious Santa Cruz Otter Resumes Attacking Surfers and Stealing Boards</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 20:16:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mysterious sea otter in Santa Cruz has once again begun attacking surfers and stealing their boards, a behavior reminiscent of the internationally known otter 841 from two years ago. The current otter's identity remains unclear, as it is untagged, but its actions closely mirror those of its predecessor. While federal wildlife officials are the lead response agency, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife currently has no plans for intervention. Research indicates that sea otter behaviors, including their unique feeding and interaction strategies, can exhibit extreme individuality and sometimes be passed down through family lines, raising questions about this otter's origins and motivations.</p>

          <p>The September Consumer Price Index (CPI) revealed an annual inflation rate of 3%, which was slightly below economists' forecasts, indicating a muted impact from President Trump's tariffs. This crucial economic data was released despite the ongoing government shutdown, primarily to facilitate the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment. Economists attribute a portion of the inflationary pressure to tariffs, as businesses pass on some import costs to consumers. The combination of rising inflation and a significant slowdown in job growth presents a complex challenge for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. Nevertheless, a quarter-point rate cut remains largely anticipated due to prevailing labor market risks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the clocks changing and winter nights drawing in, especially in northern UK regions, over a million people in the UK are susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression, marked by symptoms like lowered mood and anxiety, is directly linked to reduced daylight hours. Professor Hester Parr's 'Living with SAD' project at the University of Glasgow offers creative resources and "light routines," including therapeutic lamps being distributed in Orkney libraries. The article advocates for adopting a more positive, Scandinavian-inspired approach to winter, emphasizing outdoor engagement and creating cozy indoor light environments to effectively manage SAD symptoms and improve mental well-being.</p>

          <h2>UK MPs Advise Against Cutting Cash ISA Tax-Free Allowance in Upcoming Budget</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Treasury Select Committee, a group of Members of Parliament, has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against reducing the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the forthcoming Budget. The committee argues that such a cut, which could lower the annual limit from £20,000 to £10,000, is unlikely to foster a desired investment culture in the UK. This recommendation comes as Reeves reportedly considers various tax adjustments to address a significant £22 billion budget shortfall. The MPs stress that the country is not yet at a stage where reducing cash ISA limits would effectively incentivize broader stock and shares investment, noting widespread opposition from financial sectors.

          <h2>UK Drivers Face Dilemma as Automatic Cars Rise and Manual Driving Declines</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK drivers are increasingly choosing automatic cars, which now account for one-third of all vehicles on the road, a trend significantly driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. This shift creates a dilemma for new learners: obtaining an automatic-only license restricts them to automatics and electric vehicles, while a manual license offers broader driving flexibility. Despite the common perception that automatic tests are easier, manual tests actually boast a higher pass rate. Learners opting for automatics often face challenges such as a scarcity of instructors and higher lesson costs, yet many anticipate manual cars will soon become largely obsolete.</p>

          <p>The counting process for the Irish presidential election is scheduled to commence on Saturday, following Friday's vote to elect the country's 10th head of state. The election features two main contenders: independent politician Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, although Jim Gavin's name remains on the ballot despite his earlier withdrawal from the race. Early unofficial reports suggest that voter turnout might struggle to surpass the record low recorded in the 2018 presidential election. Ballot boxes will open at 09:00 local time, with the final result anticipated to be announced later Saturday evening at Dublin Castle, concluding several months of intense campaigning.</p>

          <p>Magnesium is rapidly gaining popularity as a "miracle mineral," with millions consuming supplements for perceived benefits related to sleep, digestion, and mental health, consequently driving a booming global market. While magnesium is undeniably vital, participating in over 300 bodily processes, dietitians caution against uncritical supplement use. They highlight the difficulty in accurately testing for true deficiency and point to the significant role of social media influencers in promoting these products. Experts like Kirsten Jackson strongly advise prioritizing a diet rich in magnesium-rich foods such as nuts, seeds, and leafy greens, warning of potential risks like diarrhea and, for those with kidney disease, life-threatening hypermagnesemia.</p>
