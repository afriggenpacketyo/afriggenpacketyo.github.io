        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, some financial experts are highlighting income funds that utilize options-based strategies as a potential haven for risk-averse investors. Invesco's senior portfolio manager, John Burrello, suggests these ETFs offer more structural protection because their performance is not solely reliant on stock correlations and can provide income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes. He notes that with an expected rate-cutting cycle, diversifying income sources away from Fed dependency is becoming increasingly important for investment portfolios. Burrello advises investors to seek funds managed by institutional professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research indicates that financial stability and the need for social and emotional support are primary motivators for men. Experts suggest that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their main source of support, making them more eager to commit. This trend is also observed by relationship coaches, who report that men are more likely to seek their services to find a partner.</p>

          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft. The incident happened as the flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, was heading to its gate with 113 passengers on board. No injuries were reported, and passengers were able to deplane normally after a delay. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other ground collisions and near-misses at U.S. airports. The cause of the collision is currently under investigation by authorities.</p>

          <p>Efforts have begun to repair the external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been reliant on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. Restoring a reliable off-site power source is considered critical for nuclear safety to ensure the cooling systems for the plant's six shutdown reactors function properly. The plant, Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since early in the full-scale invasion.</p>

Buffett argues that gold's value is purely speculative, relying on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future without it generating any intrinsic value. In contrast, he favors productive assets that deliver tangible returns, like crops from a farm or profits from a company, as their success can be rationally calculated. (not investment advice)</p>
