          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates escalating trade tensions with the United States, particularly following threats of increased tariffs from the Trump administration over India's trade with Russia. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee described its stance as "neutral," indicating a cautious approach while assessing incoming economic data. Despite the global trade challenges, India's economy has shown robust growth and low inflation, providing a stable backdrop for the bank's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Indiana Fever 100-91, extending their own successful run to eight wins in their last nine games. The Fever, who were on a five-game winning streak, played without their star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury but remained an active presence from the bench. The Sparks capitalized on Clark's absence, with strong performances from Rickea Jackson and Kelsey Plum, who each scored 25 points. The victory solidifies the Sparks' position as they move closer to securing a playoff berth, benefiting from a recently stabilized and fully healthy roster.</p>

As part of the deal, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, valued at an estimated $2.2 to $2.5 billion. Under the terms, ESPN will own and operate NFL Network, integrating it into its upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service, and will also gain distribution rights for the RedZone channel.

          <p>As Japan commemorates the 80th anniversaries of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there is a growing urgency to preserve the first-person accounts of the aging survivors, known as 'hibakusha.' With the average age of the just under 100,000 remaining survivors now over 86, their numbers are rapidly declining. In response, museums and younger generations are working to keep their stories alive to educate the world about the horrors of nuclear weapons. One such effort involves a 12-year-old 'successor' in Hiroshima who guides foreign tourists, sharing the history of the attack and the personal story of his great-grandmother, who survived the blast.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by the fall of 2026. The decision to shutter the medium-security facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, is attributed to a declining statewide prison population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. No inmates will be released early; they will be transferred to other facilities. The site has a unique history, having originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel before being converted into a prison, and local officials hope it may one day be restored.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Setting Official Targets for Consumer Spending</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among China's economists regarding whether the country should set official, measurable targets for consumption in its upcoming five-year plan. Proponents argue that establishing a benchmark, such as the household consumption rate as a share of GDP, is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand. They point out that China's rate was a low 39.6% in 2023. However, other influential thinkers are skeptical, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as policy goals. This discussion is a key point of contention as Beijing formulates its economic blueprint for the coming years.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is making significant progress in his recovery from a shoulder impingement and could return to the active roster by late August. After an underwhelming start to the season, the Japanese phenom has been on the injured list but has recently begun facing live hitters and is scheduled for a simulated game. The Dodgers are encouraged by adjustments he has made to his delivery and his addition of a two-seam fastball, which could make him a valuable asset for the team's postseason push. While his role is uncertain, his return would provide welcome pitching depth for the World Series contenders.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp's parent company, Meta, has announced that it disabled 6.8 million accounts linked to fraudulent activities in the first half of this year. The company stated many of these accounts were tied to criminal scam centers in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to target people worldwide with fake investment schemes. The crackdown coincides with WhatsApp rolling out new security features designed to alert users to suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. This initiative is part of a broader effort to combat the rising tide of online scams conducted through messaging platforms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional approval. The judge stated the move could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone communities that rely on the funding for mitigation projects like stormwater management. FEMA had previously called the program "wasteful" but recently walked back comments about its termination, stating it was still under evaluation.</p>

          <p>A massive, China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year after being stalled for 17 years. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) won the contract for the Mes Aynak Mine in 2008, but work was delayed by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. The Taliban government announced last year that the project would switch to underground mining to better protect the historical relics. This development signals a major step forward for one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, designated XFG and unofficially named "Stratus," has become the third most prevalent strain in the United States, accounting for 14% of cases by late June. The variant, a combination of two other strains, was first detected in Southeast Asia and has been growing globally. The World Health Organization has added XFG to its watchlist but assessed its public health risk as "low," advising that current vaccines should remain effective against it. While there is no evidence of more severe disease, some anecdotal reports have associated hoarseness as a potential symptom of the new variant.</p>

Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, which included a record 18.6% one-year drop in motor vehicle thefts. While experts credit various factors for the decline, the report also noted a concerning increase in the number of law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ordinance is a public health measure designed to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to give property owners time to comply. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, in addition to air conditioning, to meet the new temperature standard.</p>
