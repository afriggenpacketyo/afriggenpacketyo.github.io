          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has articulated his vision for developing "personal superintelligence," positioning it as a tool for individual empowerment rather than large-scale automation. This announcement comes as Meta invests billions to hire top AI talent from competitors like OpenAI and Google, establishing a new Meta Superintelligence Labs. The strategy is reminiscent of the company's costly pivot to the metaverse, which has accumulated over $60 billion in losses for its Reality Labs division. Zuckerberg's letter aims to frame the multi-billion dollar AI spending spree as a long-term investment in a technology that will define the next decade.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club has announced its purchase of shares in industrial firm Dover, viewing its recent stock dip as a buying opportunity. The club's analysis highlights the company's record adjusted EBITDA and strong future sales outlook, suggesting the market has not yet recognized its potential. The article also identifies Starbucks and Palo Alto Networks as other potential investments, based on the former's turnaround strategy and the latter's strategic acquisition of CyberArk. These recommendations are presented as capitalizing on current market weaknesses and strategic corporate actions for potential future gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:29:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter of 2025, a significant rebound from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile factor influenced by the Trump administration's tariff policies. While consumer spending also increased, a key underlying measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since late 2022. Economists caution that the headline GDP figure overstates the economy's true strength, suggesting that growth is moderating to a slower pace despite the strong quarterly number.

This method uses an electromagnetic beam to vaporize rock, reaching temperatures over 930 degrees Fahrenheit and potentially extracting five to ten times more power per well than traditional geothermal methods. The technology is seen as a promising solution to meet the massive energy demands of the growing AI sector and data centers.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8-magnitude quake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula did not generate the catastrophic tsunami that many had feared. This scientific analysis explains that while the megathrust quake displaced a massive amount of water, the resulting tsunami's impact is determined by various factors, including the local seafloor topography and the quake's depth. One possibility is that the earthquake occurred deeper than initial estimates, which would reduce the amplitude of the waves. The presence of advanced early warning systems across the Pacific also played a crucial role in allowing for timely evacuations.</p>

It would also create a public list of companies that offshore call center work, making them ineligible for certain federal loans and grants.
