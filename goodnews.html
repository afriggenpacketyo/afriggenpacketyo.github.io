          <p>Nine Democratic candidates for New York City mayor participated in their first debate, addressing issues such as housing, affordability, crime, and their strategies for dealing with the Trump administration. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunners, exchanged criticisms regarding their records and campaign funding. Cuomo defended his administration's handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and the sexual harassment allegations against him. The debate also featured attacks on current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is seeking re-election as an independent candidate. </p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may protect against dangerous infections. A study showed that babies with Bifidobacterium longum had a significantly lower risk of hospitalization for lung infections. Researchers believe this early encounter with microbes is crucial for immune system development. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. </p>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The ruling sides with environmental groups challenging the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. The court order will remain in effect until at least July 18, pending a full hearing on the matter. Environmental groups argue that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public input. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, spurred by concerns raised in a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Experts argue that the report's claims of harm to women are misguided and lack transparency. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review and has been used by millions of patients since then. </p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely. These prescription medicines are only available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI. </p>
