        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system named Aeneas that can fill in missing text from damaged ancient Roman inscriptions, as well as estimate their date and geographical origin. The tool assists historians by rapidly analyzing a vast database of 176,000 inscriptions to find relevant parallels, a process that would traditionally take months or years. While there are concerns about AI introducing errors, tests have shown that historians working in conjunction with Aeneas produce more accurate results than either working alone. This technology is being hailed as potentially transformative for accelerating the study and understanding of ancient history.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in select U.S. cities that will allow women drivers and riders to request a preference for being paired with other women. The feature, set to roll out next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, aims to provide more choice, control, and comfort for women using the platform. While the preference is not guaranteed, it increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman match. This initiative follows a similar feature Uber introduced in other countries and comes as the company continues to address long-standing safety concerns, including sexual assault and harassment incidents, on its platform.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Part of Tennessee Law Criminalizing Aid for Minors Seeking Out-of-State Abortions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 10:56:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a key provision of a Tennessee law that criminalized adults for helping minors obtain out-of-state abortions without parental consent. The judge ruled that the law's "recruitment provision," which banned providing information or travel assistance, constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination and violated the First Amendment. The case was brought by a Democratic state representative and a pro-abortion advocate. While this part of the law was struck down, the judge upheld other sections that criminalize physically transporting or harboring a minor for the purpose of an out-of-state abortion, rejecting claims that the law was unconstitutionally vague.</p>

This initiative, which already includes major fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, aims to transform the $7.1 trillion money market industry by enabling faster, more efficient, and continuous transactions. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds pay a yield, making them an attractive option for large investors to manage cash. The banks envision this as a foundational step toward a future where these digital assets can be seamlessly transferred as collateral, increasing efficiency across the financial system.

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that a "clean, healthy and sustainable environment" is a human right. In its ruling, the UN's highest court affirmed that states have a legal obligation to protect the climate for present and future generations and that failing to do so may violate international law. The case, initiated by Pacific Island nations, called for legal clarification on state responsibilities regarding greenhouse gas emissions. While the opinion is not legally binding, it carries significant moral and legal weight and is expected to influence future climate negotiations and litigation worldwide.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. Hayes and Palombo had been jailed for their roles in manipulating the benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs globally, but always maintained their actions were common practice and known to their superiors. Following the ruling, calls have been made for a full public inquiry into the prosecutions and the role of the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Barbados have rediscovered the Barbados threadsnake, the world's smallest-known snake, which had not been seen for almost two decades and was feared to be extinct. The tiny snake, which can fit on a coin and measures up to four inches long, was found by a research team under a rock in a small forest. The species is blind, burrows for termites and ants, and was first formally identified as a unique species in 2008. Conservationists hope that the rediscovery of this endemic creature will champion the cause for protecting the island's remaining unique wildlife habitats from further development.</p>

          <p>As rising costs and interest rates push more households into debt, financial experts are highlighting several effective relief strategies. Options range from methodical repayment plans like the debt avalanche, which prioritizes high-interest debt to save money, to debt consolidation using personal loans or balance transfer credit cards to secure a lower interest rate. For those with more severe struggles, a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can negotiate better terms with creditors. More drastic measures like debt settlement, which aims to reduce the principal owed, and bankruptcy are also available but come with significant risks to one's credit. (not investment advice)</p>

At the time, the 19-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence, while her assailant received a lighter penalty for lesser charges. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 79, sought to clear her name, leading to a retrial where prosecutors have formally apologized and requested her acquittal. The case is a landmark moment for South Korea, challenging historical judicial perspectives on self-defense in cases of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>China maintained its position as the world's leading shipbuilder but saw its share of new global orders dip to 68.3% in the first half of the year, down from nearly 75% in the same period last year. The decline in order volume is partly attributed to shipowners' caution in ordering new oil and LNG tankers, given the United States' prominent role as an exporter of these commodities. Despite the slight decrease, analysts believe China's competitive advantages in the shipbuilding industry remain strong. The US is the world's largest exporter of LNG and saw record-high crude oil exports in 2024, influencing global shipping dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed an innovative software platform that they claim breaks the "curse of dimensionality" in aircraft design, a long-standing challenge that limits the number of variables designers can optimize simultaneously. To demonstrate its capability, the researchers applied the software to the design of the US Navy's canceled X-47B stealth drone. They reported dramatic improvements by optimizing 740 variables at once, enhancing stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion—the very trade-offs that led to the American program's cancellation. This breakthrough could allow for the creation of more advanced and efficient aircraft by removing previous computational constraints.</p>

While New Hampshire ranked poorly for weather, it scored number one for safety and was in the top 10 for healthcare and tax-friendliness. Notably, no Sun Belt states like Florida or Arizona made the top 10, as the analysis emphasized that factors like public safety and access to healthcare contribute more to daily quality of life than just sunny days.

This process, known as kleptoplasty, allows the slug to sustain itself on sunlight like a plant, turning a brilliant green. The phenomenon challenges traditional views of evolution, suggesting that symbiosis—the merging of different life forms—may be a more significant evolutionary driver than previously thought. While the exact genetic mechanism remains a mystery, the slug serves as a striking example of how organisms can be far more interconnected with their environment than once believed.</p>
