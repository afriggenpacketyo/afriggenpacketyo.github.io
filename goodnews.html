          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 10:13:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates remaining high, experts advise potential homebuyers to closely monitor Federal Reserve meetings and tariff developments for potential impacts on interest rates. Strategic use of temporary rate buydowns is recommended to secure more affordable payments during the initial years of a mortgage, with the option to refinance later if rates drop. Negotiating closing cost credits from sellers can also help offset the costs of higher rates, making homeownership more accessible. Experts suggest that while waiting for lower rates might seem appealing, rising home prices could ultimately make buying later more expensive, advising buyers to act if they find an affordable home they love (not investment advice).

          <p>Alaska's congressional delegation is celebrating the Trump administration's decision to reverse a Biden-era rule that restricted oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported a 16.3% increase in U.S. sales for May, driven by an employee pricing program and despite rising tariff costs. The sales growth was primarily fueled by a 17.2% increase in vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines and a 29% rise in hybrid models. These gains offset a 25% decline in sales of all-electric vehicles, including the electric F-150. The automaker attributes the strong sales to its "From America, For America" employee pricing program, which was introduced as President Trump's auto tariffs took effect.
