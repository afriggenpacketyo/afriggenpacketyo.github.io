          <p>Several Asian economies are actively reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committed to promoting local currencies in trade and investment. This move aims to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations and strengthen regional payment connectivity, as investors and officials recognize the potential weaponization of the dollar in trade negotiations. China is promoting bilateral trade settlements in yuan, and BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems to bypass SWIFT and reduce dollar dependency. The trend reflects a broader global shift away from the greenback, with central banks gradually reducing the dollar's share in reserves, and investors increasingly hedging their U.S. dollar exposures.

          <p>Japan's ambassador to China, Kenji Kanasugi, emphasized the need for China and Japan to improve public opinion towards each other as they navigate shared concerns about tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite recovering international tourism, travel between the two countries remains sluggish due to lingering negative perceptions and anxieties among Japanese citizens about visiting China. Relations have been strained by wartime history, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's treated water release. Political friction has also increased as Tokyo aligns more closely with Washington's efforts to contain China, further complicating the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Nintendo's Switch 2 gaming system achieved record sales, surpassing 3.5 million units within four days of its launch, causing major U.S. retailers to display "out of stock" notices online. This strong start for Nintendo's first new console in eight years positions the company to potentially meet its goal of selling 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Analysts predict that initial demand will remain robust, potentially leading to even higher sales figures in the coming months. The Switch 2 has been met with enthusiasm, with fans lining up for hours to purchase the upgraded console, and this success could mirror or surpass the original Switch's popularity.</p>

          <p>Preparations for the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico, are overshadowed by political tensions, including protests in Los Angeles, trade disputes, and potential travel bans.

Despite these challenges, experts believe that both Canada and Mexico will stand up to Trump's policies, and fans will still travel to the games.

          <p>A recent report by PwC suggests that the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) may diminish the importance of formal college degrees, as skills and knowledge become more rapidly outdated. The report indicates that employers are placing greater emphasis on current skills rather than past education, particularly in AI-exposed fields. With AI tools facilitating rapid knowledge acquisition, individuals are encouraged to upskill in AI to remain competitive in the evolving job market.
