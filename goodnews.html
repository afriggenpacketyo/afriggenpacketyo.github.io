          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a Belarusian opposition leader jailed in 2020 after challenging Alexander Lukashenko, has been released from prison. Rights group Viasna reported that Tsikhanouski was pardoned. Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in her husband's place, released a video thanking the U.S. for its efforts in securing his release. His release coincided with a visit by U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

This follows National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard's testimony that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Reed believes Trump may be rejecting this assessment to justify a potential attack against Iran. He added that if Gabbard made a false statement, it should be corrected immediately.</p>

          <p>The superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily last year, has been recovered. The yacht sank during a storm, resulting in the deaths of British tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others. The recovery operation involved slowly raising the vessel from the seabed and pumping out the seawater. The hull will be transported to Termini Imerese for further investigation into the cause of the sinking. A previous report indicated the yacht was likely knocked over by extreme wind, and the recovery is crucial for understanding the full circumstances of the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts and dermatologists suggest that US sunscreens are less effective than those available overseas, particularly in UVA protection. Regulatory differences, where sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug, limit the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients in the US. Other countries, like France and South Korea, have approved a wider range of ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen, suggesting broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling favors civil liberties groups who argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and isolates non-Christian students. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws have been challenged in Arkansas and await signature in Texas, setting up a potential legal battle over religion in schools.</p>
