          <h2>Navigating Shopping Amidst Evolving U.S. Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 07:30:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With fluctuating tariff policies causing consumer uncertainty, shopping expert Trae Bodge offers advice on how to save money. Key tips include looking for sales events like Memorial Day and Amazon Prime Day, checking the origin of products to understand tariff impacts (especially considering the USMCA agreement), and purchasing domestic goods to avoid price hikes on imported produce. Bodge advises against panic shopping, suggesting instead that consumers accelerate planned purchases of big-ticket items like dishwashers or laptops. This strategic approach helps mitigate potential price increases due to tariffs. Optimism remains relatively stable as consumers are given actionable steps to avoid the worst of economic issues.</p>

          <p>Toyota has unveiled a redesigned version of its all-electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S., renaming it the 'bZ' from 'bZ4X' for the 2026 model year, likely to distance it from its poorly reviewed predecessor. The original bZ4X faced criticism and a recall due to wheel detachment issues. The 2026 bZ addresses these concerns with a 25% increase in EV range and up to 50% improvement in horsepower. These upgrades aim to enhance the vehicle's competitiveness in the EV market, improving the outlook for Toyota's EV offerings.</p>
