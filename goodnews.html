Strong performance in its streaming division and theme parks helped to counterbalance the ongoing decline in its traditional television business.

Disney also raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in its future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite implementing significant cost-cutting measures, Manchester United is reportedly in a position to finance a major transfer for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, valued at up to £74 million. The club's ability to pursue the deal is attributed to savvy financial management, including structuring payments over long-term contracts and generating funds by loaning out players with high salaries. This approach allows the club to make substantial investments in its squad while navigating a period of financial restructuring under its new ownership.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has officially approved the €13.5 billion ($15.5 billion) construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, which will link Sicily to the mainland. The project, which has been debated for decades, is set to become the world's longest suspension bridge upon completion, carrying both road and rail traffic. Proponents, like Transport Minister Matteo Salvini, hail it as a revolutionary development for southern Italy, despite persistent concerns over seismic risks, environmental impacts, and potential mafia interference.</p>

The program will run from September 29, 2025, to June 30, 2026, allowing organized groups of Chinese tourists to enter the country without a visa. This policy is expected to revitalize regional economies and follows a similar unilateral visa-free measure that Beijing extended to South Korean travelers last year, reflecting a mutual effort to encourage travel between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a formal blog post, chipmaking giant Nvidia has publicly declared that its products do not contain any hidden "back doors, kill switches, or spyware." The company's chief security officer emphasized that embedding such vulnerabilities would be counterproductive to building trustworthy systems and would be a gift to malicious actors. This statement serves as a direct rebuttal to speculation and aims to reassure customers and governments amid heightened geopolitical tensions surrounding the security of advanced AI technology.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual crime report, violent crime rates in the United States fell to their lowest levels since the 1960s during 2024. The data, voluntarily submitted by thousands of law enforcement agencies, showed a 4.5% year-on-year decrease in overall violent crime, with murders dropping by 14.5%. These figures directly contradict the political narrative of a surging, out-of-control crime wave that was prevalent during the recent presidential election campaign, indicating the nation was safer than it had been in decades.</p>
