          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has elevated his ‚Äúelection integrity‚Äù accusations to the criminal level, targeting a county judge, two City Council members, and a former county election administrator. The individuals were indicted for ‚Äúvote harvesting‚Äù and tampering with evidence, sparking surprise among Latino voting rights activists who claim the raids by Paxton's office are politically motivated and aimed at suppressing Latino voters. The investigation stems from a referral from a Republican district attorney and follows Donald Trump's false claims of voter fraud, with Paxton's office vowing to continue working to protect election integrity. The article highlights the ongoing debate over voter suppression and election integrity in Texas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the possibility of federal funds rate cuts looming, savers are considering whether to renew their maturing CD accounts. Despite potential rate cuts, renewing a CD account can still be a smart move, as the rate cut trajectory could change and the cuts are likely to be small. The article argues that avoiding a high-rate CD account based on speculation doesn't make sense, and savers would benefit from renewing to earn high returns regardless of broader rate climate. The article recommends assessing options with your bank to determine which will be better for your maturing funds now.</p>

          <p>Homeowners should consider three key factors before pursuing a $100,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC): it's the cheapest way to borrow home equity now, it's likely to become less expensive in the months ahead, and volatility will need to be priced in. With average home equity levels high, many homeowners may be exploring their borrowing options, but a HELOC's variable interest rate requires careful planning. The article recommends calculating repayments against various interest rate scenarios and considering a home equity loan if a fixed rate is preferred.</p>
