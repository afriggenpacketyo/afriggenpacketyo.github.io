          <p>A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has commenced, marked by the release of the final 20 living hostages captured on October 7, 2023. The exchange also includes the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. As part of the diplomatic efforts, President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset and is attending a peace summit in Egypt with other world leaders. The article notes that some released hostages are now receiving comprehensive medical and psychological care as they reunite with family.</p>

          <p>Despite Meta Platforms' stock being stuck in a range recently, analysts at Citi have placed a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the company. This optimism is based on signs of growth in Meta's core advertising business and estimates that it is gaining a larger share of ad budgets. While concerns exist about competition from OpenAI's video generation tool, Sora, the firm sees potential for the stock to move higher, setting a price target of $915. The broader tech market saw gains, partly fueled by a new partnership between OpenAI and Broadcom. (not investment advice)</p>

In an interview, the actors emphasized that the movie is designed to provoke conversation and debate about its blurred moral lines and ambiguous truths.

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that the Middle East is "doomed" without a viable peace process that leads to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Speaking ahead of a peace summit in Egypt, the king emphasized that a two-state solution is the only path to lasting stability in the region. He expressed hope that the current U.S.-brokered ceasefire could provide a political horizon for progress but conveyed deep mistrust of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. King Abdullah stressed the urgency of the moment, stating that peace is the only option to avoid perpetual conflict.</p>

          <p>In a high-interest-rate environment, several persistent myths about credit card debt can negatively impact personal finances. Contrary to popular belief, carrying a balance does not improve your credit score; it only costs you money in interest. Another harmful misconception is that making only the minimum payment is an effective debt management strategy, when in reality it can take decades to pay off the principal. The article also debunks the idea that closing old credit cards is beneficial, explaining that it can actually harm your credit score by increasing your utilization ratio and shortening your credit history.

          <p>Jack Wilshere, once an Arsenal prodigy whose playing career was curtailed by injuries, has been appointed manager of League One side Luton at the age of 33. This marks a return to the club where he began as a youth player before joining Arsenal. After retiring as a player in 2022, Wilshere transitioned to coaching, working with Arsenal's U-18s and as a first-team coach at Norwich. He now takes charge of a Luton team aiming to recover after successive relegations from the Premier League, hoping to build a new identity as a manager.</p>

          <p>This article explores the unexpected mood of hope in Israel and Gaza following the start of a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners. The author speaks with Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh, who describes a "paradoxical optimism" born from the immense suffering of the past two years, suggesting people may now be more willing to consider new paths to peace. While acknowledging the fragility of the situation, the piece posits that the end of the war could create space for a new political reality to emerge. The analysis credits President Trump's unconventional approach with creating an opportunity for this potential shift.</p>

          <p>Scottish football club Rangers is reassessing its options for a new head coach after top candidate Steven Gerrard ruled himself out of a return to the club. A new shortlist has been compiled, reportedly containing more than two names. Former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl is said to have held talks with the club. However, other previously linked managers, including Graham Potter and Michael Carrick, are reportedly not among the current candidates. The club is seeking a replacement for the recently sacked Russell Martin, but an announcement is not expected in the immediate future.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded on Monday, recovering a significant portion of the losses incurred after President Trump's surprise threat of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports late last week. The market rally was fueled by the president's more conciliatory tone over the weekend, where he stated on social media that relations with China "will all be fine." The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both saw substantial gains, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq also rising. The initial tariff threat had caused the S&P 500's worst single-day drop since April, highlighting the market's sensitivity to trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

The comments come after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods following the imprisonment of former president Jair Bolsonaro.

This improved outlook persists despite challenges from tariffs and inflation. However, the forecast for the labor market is less robust, with predictions of weaker job gains for the remainder of the year and an unemployment rate rising to 4.5% in 2026.

          <p>This article examines the monthly payments for a $300,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current interest rate environment. With average HELOC rates now at 7.84% following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, a 10-year loan would cost approximately $3,615 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $2,839. These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago when rates were higher. The article explains that since HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers can automatically benefit from future rate cuts without needing to refinance. (not investment advice)</p>
