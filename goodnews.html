          <h2>Katy Perry Experiences Mid-Concert Prop Malfunction in San Francisco</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:27:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped. While performing her song "Roar" suspended over the audience, the prop malfunctioned, causing a brief but startling dip. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. The incident highlights the risks associated with complex aerial stunts commonly used in modern large-scale concert productions, similar to a recent issue on Beyoncé's tour.</p>

          <p>A weather alert has been issued for the Boston region, with strong to severe storms expected on Sunday afternoon and evening. The primary threat is damaging wind gusts, with a secondary risk of large hail, particularly in areas north of Massachusetts. A cold front is expected to trigger the storms, which will move through western Massachusetts in the afternoon and reach the Boston area between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Forecasters are advising residents to stay near safe indoor locations and have a way to receive weather warnings.</p>

          <h2>UK Debates Pros and Cons of Shorter Summer School Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue a shorter break could help reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and mitigate "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, stress the need for a long break to recharge and plan, and some fear it could concentrate vacation demand, driving up prices. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of the school calendar in response to modern economic and social pressures.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor has suggested that savers are missing out on financial rewards by favoring safe cash accounts (Isas) over stocks and shares investments. The government is considering new policies to encourage investment, including sending details of investment opportunities to those with low-interest savings and potentially altering the tax-free allowance for cash Isas. Critics warn this could backfire if new investors face market volatility, while others point out the need to address the gender gap in investing. The debate centers on shifting some of the £300 billion held in cash Isas to fuel the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defensive specialist Marcus Smart is set to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. The former Defensive Player of the Year plans to sign a two-year, $11-million deal, filling a key need for a strong perimeter defender on the Lakers' roster. Smart, who spent most of his career with the Boston Celtics, brings toughness and experience to a team looking to contend in the competitive Western Conference. His addition is seen as a crucial move to bolster the team's defense alongside its offensive stars.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are seriously considering a reunion with veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who played for the Clippers from 2011 to 2017, would add depth, playmaking, and veteran leadership to the roster. The potential signing aligns with the team's strategy to increase its ball-handling capabilities and support its current stars. At 40, Paul would likely accept a reserve role, contributing his experience to a team with championship aspirations in the Western Conference.</p>

Germany played over 100 minutes with only 10 players after an early red card, but managed to equalize and hold on.

          <p>Interest in learning Mandarin, once touted as the language of the future, appears to be declining in several Western nations, including the U.S., UK, and New Zealand. University enrollments for Chinese language studies in the U.S. and Britain have dropped significantly from their peaks over the last decade. While data is limited, the trend suggests a shift away from the language, potentially influenced by geopolitical tensions and changing perceptions of China's global role. This marks a notable reversal after years of rapid growth in Mandarin language programs across the Global North.</p>

His day included a bizarre incident where his shot from the rough dislodged another golf ball that had been buried underground, leading to a bogey. However, he immediately recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole, thrilling the supportive home crowd at Portrush. Despite the rollercoaster round, McIlroy finished the day six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler but feels he has given himself "half a chance" for a final-day charge.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on a stronger European security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, known as the "E3." This shift, marked by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about the United States' commitment to NATO under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK could supplement, or even one day replace, the US security guarantee for Europe.

For Rashford, the move represents a chance to revitalize his career at a top European club.

          <p>A report from Bank of America has made a striking comparison, suggesting that quantum computing could represent the most significant human breakthrough since the discovery of fire. Analysts argue the technology's ability to perform incredibly complex calculations at near-instant speeds could "warp-speed human knowledge and development." They predict it could revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and logistics, and could also turbocharge the development of artificial intelligence. While major milestones have been achieved, a quantum computer has not yet solved a practical, real-world problem faster than a classical computer. (not investment advice)</p>
