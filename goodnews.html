          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, has dedicated a new seven-foot bronze statue, 'Requiem,' commemorating the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre where 28 Chinese people were killed and 14 injured. This initiative, supported by local students and history museums, marks a significant shift from a previously inconspicuous plaque, aiming to acknowledge a violent chapter of its anti-immigrant past. The monument's unveiling comes as researchers unearth artifacts from the burned Chinatown, providing a deeper understanding of the labor tensions that led to the deadliest incident of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history. Mayor Max Mickelson, despite his county's anti-immigrant voting record, advocates for honoring the town's diverse migrant history.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has expressed confidence that his party can "pull this round" as they head into their annual conference, despite recent opinion polls showing Labour trailing Reform UK. Starmer used the opportunity to renew his attacks on Nigel Farage, accusing Reform of seeking to "tear this country apart" with divisive policies, particularly regarding immigration. He highlighted the conference as a platform for Labour to offer an alternative to what he termed "toxic divide and decline." Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also commented on immigration, emphasizing the need for migrants to contribute to their wider community for long-term settlement.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has acknowledged and thanked Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for its 17-year investment, following reports that Berkshire sold its remaining stake earlier this year. BYD executives described the divestment as "completely normal" for investors, noting Berkshire made a substantial profit. Despite this unfazed public stance, BYD's shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong, reflecting investor concerns. The company recently cut its 2025 sales target and reported its first quarterly profit decline in over three years, signaling potential cooling in its rapid growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Return May Signal a Shift Away from Ideology in US-China Relations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 21:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that the return of US President Donald Trump could lead to a "reverse convergence" in US-China relations, moving away from traditional ideological frameworks. The author suggests that the US may adopt an approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace more akin to China's, rather than China converging with liberal democratic values. This perspective challenges the long-held Western "convergence theory," which oversimplifies global social change and power dynamics. The article argues that this potential shift marks an early stage of a future trend, altering the dynamics between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry secured a vital fourballs victory at the Ryder Cup, extending Europe's lead to 11½-4½ despite facing a hostile New York crowd at Bethpage. The European pair endured crude personal insults and disruptive shouts, with Lowry nearly confronting a fan and McIlroy forced to back away from shots. European captain Luke Donald condemned the "personal insults" and lack of golfing etiquette, while security was enhanced and warnings displayed to fans. Their win, sealed on the 18th green, was crucial in moving Europe within three points of their first away victory since 2012.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first commercial rice crop in Cambridgeshire, an experiment previously dismissed as a joke, now ripe for picking after the country's hottest summer on record. Led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, this trial explores future food sources and climate change mitigation. Growing rice on re-wetted peat soils could lock in greenhouse gases, offering a model for sustainable agriculture. While commercial viability is still distant, the project suggests UK-grown rice could become a reality within a decade, addressing both food security and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have won an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes affect the experience of using a shoe rack. Their research, stemming from observations in university hostels, identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the culprit and demonstrated that a short blast of UVC light effectively eliminates the odor by killing microbes. The study led to a prototype for a UVC-equipped shoe rack, providing a delightfully inventive solution to a universal domestic problem. This article highlights the humorous yet inventive nature of Ig Nobel-winning scientific endeavors.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's forthcoming book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers a rare glimpse into his 30 years as the court's swing justice, particularly his decisive votes on same-sex marriage and abortion. Kennedy, who states "The cases swung, not me," expresses deep concern over America's current political discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival. He recounts the personal impact of his gay marriage decision on his relationship with Justice Scalia and his own moral conflicts regarding abortion, ultimately upholding a woman's choice based on constitutional liberty. This article delves into his evolving judicial philosophy.</p>

          <h2>The Efficacy of Collagen Supplements in Reducing Signs of Skin Ageing Explored</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, examining various forms like marine, bovine, and vegan collagen. While some users report positive effects on skin, hair, and nails, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin cells directly. Industry-funded studies often suggest significant improvements, contrasting with independent research showing no effect. Experts recommend marine collagen for its Type 1 content, but ultimately advise that sunblock, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking have a far greater impact on skin health than expensive supplements.</p>
