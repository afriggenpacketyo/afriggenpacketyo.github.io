          <p>Above the Law, a legal industry website, has become a hub for lawyers critical of major law firms that have agreed to provide pro bono services to President Trump. The article details how the site has gained traction by publishing leaks and insider information, often skewering firms perceived as accommodating the president. Lawyers within these firms, feeling demoralized, are using Above the Law as a platform for catharsis, according to the article. The site's founder, David Lat, notes that the site's coverage has even led to better treatment of administrative staff within the targeted firms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will "eat some of the tariffs" imposed by President Trump, following a direct demand from the president. This claim contradicts earlier statements from Walmart indicating that the company would need to raise prices for consumers to offset tariff costs. The article notes that Trump's initial tariff plans sparked market turmoil and criticism, leading to a partial reversal with reduced tariffs on China. Bessent maintains that Walmart's initial warnings were a "worst-case scenario" for legal purposes.</p>

Hawaiians have been sewing leis for over 1,000 years, using them as an expression of aloha. However, an estimated 90% of flowers used in leis are now imported due to dwindling local flower farms. Lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis."</p>
