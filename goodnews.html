          <p>The UK government is considering transforming the state-owned Post Office into a mutually-run business owned by its employees. This proposal comes as part of a public consultation on the service's future, aiming to reform its culture following the major Horizon IT scandal. The scandal resulted in hundreds of sub-postmasters being wrongfully convicted of theft due to faulty accounting software. The consultation will also review the necessity of maintaining 11,500 branches and what future services, such as banking, the Post Office should provide to ensure its viability.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with top accounts providing high, locked-in rates. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 2.01% APY, some online banks offer significantly higher rates, such as 4.40% APY for a one-year term. The article suggests that savers can find the best rates by exploring online banks, which have lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs due to the current inverted yield curve.

          <p>For individuals seeking a safe place for emergency funds, high-yield savings accounts currently offer interest rates that significantly surpass national averages, providing a buffer against inflation. While the national average savings rate is a low 0.38% APY, top high-yield accounts from online banks are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30%. The article recommends that consumers choose high-yield accounts, specifically from online banks that pass on operational savings, and compare different options to maximize their earnings on savings.

          <p>Chris Kirby, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, transformed a small-scale hummus operation started with a $450 blender into a company projected to earn $50 million this year. After leaving a career in restaurants, Kirby developed Ithaca Hummus while studying at Cornell, initially selling at a local farmers market. By focusing on deep market penetration rather than rapid geographic expansion, the brand grew steadily and is now sold in over 8,000 stores. Kirby has maintained control by avoiding venture capital, focusing on profitability and long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular safe-haven asset, with its price subject to various market forces. As of July 11, 2025, the price of gold stood at $3,357.20 per ounce, though this figure fluctuates based on factors like supply and demand, economic conditions, and inflation. The article explains that geopolitical uncertainty and a weaker U.S. dollar tend to drive gold prices up, while rising interest rates can make the non-yielding asset less attractive. Central bank policies and overall market sentiment also play a significant role in its valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is renewing its diplomatic efforts to have global nuclear powers sign its Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (SEANWFZ). Adopted in 1995, the treaty aims to keep the region free of nuclear weapons. Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to signing the treaty without reservation, and there are indications Russia may follow suit. This diplomatic push occurs as global powers like the U.S. and China compete for influence in the region, with the AUKUS submarine pact creating additional regional tensions.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a former member of New York City's rent guidelines board defends the concept of a citywide rent freeze for stabilized apartments, arguing it is a critical lifeline, not an unrealistic idea. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she asserts that freezes are necessary to protect low- and moderate-income New Yorkers from homelessness. The author argues that criticism of rent freezes is part of a broader real estate industry agenda to weaken and ultimately dismantle rent stabilization protections, which landlords have challenged in court.</p>
