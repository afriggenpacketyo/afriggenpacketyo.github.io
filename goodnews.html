          <p>In an era dominated by artificial intelligence, the ability to discern quality and appropriateness, or 'taste,' is becoming increasingly valuable, according to this article. AI can generate vast amounts of content, but it lacks the human sensibility to determine what is meaningful, beautiful, or resonant. The article argues that taste, cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, is essential for leaders and individuals alike. It highlights the ethical dimension of taste, emphasizing the importance of integrity and awareness in decision-making to avoid amplifying biases and exacerbating societal problems.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that belief in 'love at first sight' has significantly increased among single Americans, rising nearly 30 percent since 2014. The survey suggests this trend may be linked to the prevalence of dating apps, which encourage quick judgments about potential partners. Psychologists note that while 'passionate love' may occur rapidly, its long-term sustainability is uncertain, and 'compassionate love' develops over time. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey reveals a continued belief in lasting love among singles.</p>
