          <p>England's women's football team, the Lionesses, returned home to a jubilant reception after winning the Euro 2025 tournament. They secured their title in a dramatic 3-1 penalty shootout against Spain, with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton making two crucial saves. Hundreds of fans greeted the team at the airport, and they later attended a reception at Downing Street hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. An open-top bus parade is scheduled in London to celebrate the victory, which was the most-watched television event of the year in the UK.</p>

          <h2>A Financial Guideline for Retirees: Understanding the 4% Rule in the Context of Annuities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 15:55:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the "4% rule," a well-known retirement strategy suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a portfolio annually will likely make it last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against what a traditional portfolio could provide. For instance, an annuity offering a 5% payout rate might seem superior to a 4% withdrawal, but factors like inflation adjustments and liquidity must be considered. The rule helps retirees evaluate if an annuity's security and longevity protection outweigh the flexibility of traditional investments, often suggesting a hybrid approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tropical storm in the central Pacific has rapidly intensified to become Hurricane Iona, the first hurricane of the season in that region. Located approximately 895 miles southeast of Honolulu, the Category 1 storm does not currently pose an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Iona to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. While the central Pacific has been quiet, the eastern Pacific has already seen several named storms this season, including two major hurricanes.</p>

          <h2>Wall Street's Recession Fears Ease as Trump's Trade War Tariffs Appear Less Severe Than Feared</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 15:10:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street's worst fears about a tariff-induced recession are subsiding as the effective tariff rates from the Trump administration's trade policies appear to be settling in a 15-20% range, lower than the 25% or more that was once feared. Following a trade deal with the European Union, economists are noting that the drag on the U.S. economy may not be large enough to trigger a full-blown recession. Major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase have lowered their recession risk assessment, citing a strong global growth backdrop and a more modest inflationary impact than initially anticipated.

          <h2>Judge Orders Trump Administration to Continue Medicaid Funding for Planned Parenthood Clinics Nationwide</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 15:05:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. The order blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to halt these payments for one year to abortion providers. In her ruling, Judge Indira Talwani stated that cutting off the funds would likely cause patients to suffer adverse health consequences, including reduced access to contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Planned Parenthood had argued that it would risk closing nearly 200 clinics, potentially affecting over a million patients, if the Medicaid funding were to be cut off.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale, two-year study of over 2,100 older adults provides strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve thinking and memory. Participants in the intensive program, which included aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and cognitive training, showed cognitive function scores similar to people one to two years younger. The results from the POINTER study suggest that such lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline. Researchers are now focused on translating these findings into accessible community programs to promote better brain health nationwide.</p>

          <p>Shareholders of Wise, a major UK-based financial technology company, have voted to move its main stock market listing to the United States. The company believes a U.S. listing will provide greater access to the world's largest capital market and increase its brand awareness there. The vote was controversial because it was bundled with a proposal to extend a dual-class share structure, which grants enhanced voting rights to its co-founder and CEO. Despite opposition from another co-founder, the resolution passed with a strong majority, and the move is expected in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
