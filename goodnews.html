          <p>A new tax bill proposes 'Trump Accounts,' similar to 529 college savings plans, offering tax incentives for early savings. Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While custodial brokerage accounts may incur a 'kiddie tax,' 529 plans offer tax-free growth for qualified education expenses. Experts suggest 529 plans are superior for higher education savings due to federal tax-free growth and the option to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed President Trump's tax bill, a victory for the GOP but sparking concerns over its economic impact. The bill includes tax cuts and spending adjustments, with Democrats opposing its effects on the social safety net. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would disproportionately benefit higher-income households. While the bill advances to the Senate, its path is uncertain as several Republican senators have expressed the need for significant changes. On Wall Street, major indexes fell as analysts worried about the bill's potential to increase federal deficits.</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the U.S. starting in June, following a similar warning from Adidas regarding the impact of tariffs.

Almost all of Nike's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100 and clothing and equipment, with exemptions for certain products like Air Force 1 trainers and children's items.</p>

          <p>The spring housing market continues to struggle, with sales of previously owned homes in April falling to the slowest pace since 2009. High interest rates and low consumer confidence are contributing factors, as sales decreased 0.5% from March and 2% from the previous year. Inventory jumped 9% month-to-month and nearly 21% year-over-year, leading to cooler prices. The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, a modest increase of 1.8% year-over-year, and cancellation rates are rising.</p>

          <h2>UK Public Sector Workers Offered Up to 4.5% Pay Rises</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 09:20:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of public sector workers in the UK, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay rises of between 3.6% and 4.5%. The government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies higher than the 2.8% it previously budgeted for. While unions had threatened action if pay awards were not increased, the Treasury has said rises above this will have to be funded through savings from existing budgets. The education department has announced additional funding to cover the rises, but schools will be asked to partially fund the awards through improved productivity and smarter spending.</p>
