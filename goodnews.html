          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have introduced a series of measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amidst ongoing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China aims to boost liquidity and support key sectors such as technology and real estate, alongside initiatives for consumption and elderly care. However, some economists believe that borrowing may not be significantly impacted by these rate adjustments. The Chinese government is also planning further support for small and medium enterprises and the private sector to mitigate the effects of tariffs and promote employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mitsubishi Motors has signed a memorandum with Foxconn's EV developing arm, Foxtron Vehicle Technologies, to outsource the production of electric vehicles. The EVs are intended for rollout in Australia and New Zealand in the latter half of next year, with manufacturing to be undertaken by Yulon Motor Co. in Taiwan. This agreement signifies a notable shift for the Japanese auto industry, which has traditionally been hesitant to outsource manufacturing outside the automotive sector. Additionally, Mitsubishi plans to launch new EVs supplied by Nissan, targeting the North American market in 2026.</p>

          <p>China's modernization efforts, guided by the Communist Party, are rooted in its unique history, culture, and national conditions, with a focus on socialist principles. This path prioritizes common prosperity and aims to reduce wealth gaps, contrasting with modernization models that have widened disparities. The Chinese approach emphasizes balancing material advancement with cultural and ethical development, nurturing creativity and well-rounded individual growth. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, China's modernization process presents both complex challenges and valuable experiences for other nations with large populations.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have largely disregarded the recent escalation of tensions with Pakistan, maintaining optimism due to India's strong growth prospects and macro fundamentals. Analysts suggest that structural reforms and resilient domestic demand are contributing factors, with investors viewing any market pauses as momentary. The progress in India's trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., also supports market confidence. Experts believe that Indian assets will remain stable despite the increase in geopolitical tensions, citing historical precedents and strong investor sentiment.</p>

          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in Parliament in England and Wales that would allow criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings to face an additional two years in prison. This measure aims to prevent offenders from evading justice, as highlighted by victims' families whose loved ones' killers refused to attend sentencing. The bill also grants judges additional powers to punish offenders who disrupt court proceedings. Supporters of the bill view it as a step in the right direction, ensuring that victims' families receive some measure of peace and justice.</p>
