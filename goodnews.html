          <h2>Boeing Reports Significantly Reduced Losses and Increased Sales in Second Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:10:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing announced a major improvement in its second-quarter financial performance, substantially reducing its losses and increasing revenue by 35% to $22.75 billion. The company's recovery is highlighted by its delivery of 150 airplanes, the most in a single quarter since 2018, before the 737 Max crises began. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism, labeling 2025 as a potential "turnaround year" while noting that production of the 737 Max has stabilized at the FAA's limit of 38 per month. However, challenges persist, including further delays in the certification of its new Max 7 and Max 10 models and the looming possibility of a strike at its defense unit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Resist Presidential Pressure and Maintain Current Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:08:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's urgent calls for interest rate cuts, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady this week. Economists place the probability of the Fed maintaining its current rate at 96%, as policymakers remain focused on controlling inflation. For months, Trump has publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering borrowing costs, but Powell has consistently argued that the economy's solid performance does not necessitate immediate cuts. The central bank aims to preserve its ability to act if the administration's new tariffs reignite inflationary pressures, with most analysts predicting a potential rate cut is more likely in September.

          <h2>JPMorgan Nears Agreement to Assume Control of Apple Card from Goldman Sachs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:03:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card credit card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. According to sources familiar with the matter, JPMorgan has emerged as the leading contender after other potential issuers like American Express and Barclays stepped aside. The move would transfer Apple's significant credit card business, including its substantial loan book, to the nation's largest card issuer. This development follows Goldman Sachs's decision to exit its consumer-facing partnerships, marking a strategic shift for both financial institutions and a major consolidation in the co-branded card market.

          <p>American swimmer Katie Ledecky continued her historic dominance by winning another gold medal in the 1,500-meter freestyle at the swimming world championships in Singapore. Finishing with a time of 15:26.44, she now holds 25 of the top 26 fastest times ever recorded in the event. This victory marks her 22nd world championship gold and her 28th overall world medal, further solidifying her status as the most decorated female swimmer in history. The win was a bright spot for the U.S. team, which has been contending with a widespread gastroenteritis illness that affected many of its athletes before the competition began.</p>

          <h2>IMF Raises Global Growth Forecast, Citing Easing US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, now projecting 3% growth in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. This upward revision is partly attributed to a surge in U.S. imports as businesses rushed to get ahead of impending tariffs, a phenomenon known as "front-loading." The IMF noted that the softening of some U.S. tariffs and proactive growth measures by certain governments have contributed to the more optimistic outlook. However, the organization also warned that the potential for higher future tariffs and increased global uncertainty could still suppress economic activity and pose risks to the stability of the recovery.</p>

          <p>A representative for musician Phil Collins has refuted widespread online rumors that the 74-year-old Genesis frontman is in hospice care. The spokesperson clarified that Collins is currently recovering from a recent knee surgery and is not terminally ill. Concerns for his health have been ongoing, as Collins has publicly discussed his struggles with a spinal injury from 2007 that left him with nerve damage and unable to play the drums. During Genesis's 2022 tour, he performed while seated in a chair. The representative stated that any speculation about him being in hospice is "completely incorrect," reassuring fans about his condition.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new initiative called "Green Apron Service" to refocus on hospitality and improve the customer experience in its cafes. The strategy, part of CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan, emphasizes warm and engaging interactions to make Starbucks visits a consistent habit for consumers. This program is a response to lackluster sales and aims to create a more welcoming environment, supported by better staffing and technology to maintain fast service times. The company is investing heavily in this human-centric approach, hoping that superior guest experience will differentiate it in a competitive market and help reverse recent declines in same-store sales.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual trade development, Indian importers have purchased a record 150,000 metric tons of soyoil from China. This move was driven by a supply glut in China, which prompted Chinese crushers to offer the oil at a significant discount compared to India's traditional suppliers in South America. A surge in soybean imports led to excess soyoil and soymeal inventories in China, creating an opportunity for Indian buyers to secure the commodity at a lower price. The deal benefits both nations, helping Chinese producers reduce their stockpiles while providing India with a more competitively priced source of edible oil.</p>

          <p>An international research team has confirmed that a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, known as Catalhoyuk, was a society centered around women. By analyzing DNA from 131 skeletons buried under homes, scientists discovered that household members were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilineal structure where men moved in with the woman's family. This finding supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The study also revealed that grave goods were far more abundant with female bodies than male ones, further suggesting an elevated societal status for women in one of the world's oldest inhabited places.</p>

          <p>India, home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tigers, has reported an increase in its tiger population to over 3,600. Despite this conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain, primarily due to habitat fragmentation. The expansion of agriculture, infrastructure, and urban areas is dividing forests into smaller, isolated patches, which disrupts tiger movement, breeding, and access to prey. Conservationists emphasize that protecting these vital wildlife corridors is as crucial as increasing population numbers. The ongoing challenge is to balance development with the preservation of functional ecosystems to ensure the long-term survival of the species.</p>

          <p>According to Juliet Schor, a lead researcher who has studied hundreds of companies piloting a four-day, 32-hour workweek, three key strategies are crucial for a successful transition. The first is aggressively cutting down on meetings by making them shorter, more efficient, or replacing them with written updates. The second involves re-engineering work processes to be more efficient, such as by optimizing tasks in a factory setting. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects that do not align with core goals. These methods have allowed businesses to maintain productivity and boost profits while improving employee well-being.</p>
