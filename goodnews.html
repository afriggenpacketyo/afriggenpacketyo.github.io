          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated he was not pressured by President Trump on how to vote on interest rates ahead of the recent decision. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the committee approved, confirmed his conversation with the president was brief and congratulatory. He dismissed concerns about his independence, emphasizing his commitment to explaining his differing economic views and his intention to serve only until his term ends in January 2026. The discussion highlights ongoing tensions regarding the Federal Reserve's autonomy under the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fate of TikTok in the U.S. may depend on a licensing agreement for its powerful algorithm, a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and China. The Chinese government, which previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, now appears open to a deal involving "the use of intellectual property rights." This potential framework could allow a new U.S. entity to use the technology under license from parent company ByteDance, though national security concerns about data access and content manipulation remain. A final agreement is pending a call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made significant progress toward a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, but did not finalize an agreement. This outcome follows earlier statements from the administration suggesting a deal was nearly complete. Under a U.S. law, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, must divest its American business or face a ban, a deadline President Trump has repeatedly extended, most recently to December 16. The ongoing negotiations reflect the complexities of balancing national security concerns with the app's significant commercial value.</p>

The session was challenging for McLaren's Lando Norris, who crashed at Turn Four, damaging his car and limiting his track time, which he described as a "costly" mistake. Despite the crash, Leclerc noted that McLaren's true pace seemed formidable, suggesting they could be a major threat in qualifying. Hamilton expressed satisfaction with improvements made to his car's braking system, feeling more confident on the demanding Baku street circuit.</p>

          <h2>Retailers Adopt 'Tariff Hacking' Shipping Strategies to Mitigate Trade War Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 11:36:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a "B2B2C" (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the financial impact of U.S. tariffs on consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party merchant of record, which purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price. Companies like ESW and Global-e facilitate this process, allowing retailers to absorb tariff costs without raising prices. While some see this as a creative adaptation, customs brokers warn it could be a short-term solution that risks future audits and scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever have advanced to the WNBA semifinals for the first time since 2015 after a dramatic 87-85 Game 3 victory over the Atlanta Dream. The team achieved this milestone despite the season-ending injury to their star player, Caitlin Clark. Aliyah Boston scored the game-winning basket with just 7.4 seconds remaining, and Lexie Hull secured the win with a subsequent steal. The sixth-seeded Fever will now face the No. 2 seed Las Vegas Aces in the next round of the playoffs, capping a remarkable and resilient run.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the price increase for the new iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking at the launch of the new models, Cook stated there was "no increase for tariffs in the prices." This statement comes after analysts widely expected tariffs to impact pricing, even as Apple has been shifting its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam to mitigate these costs. During the previous quarter, Apple reported an $800 million hit from tariff-related expenses, highlighting the financial pressures from ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw's upcoming start, potentially his last at Dodger Stadium before his announced retirement, will be broadcast exclusively on Apple TV+. The game is part of a package of Friday night games that Major League Baseball sold to the streaming service, meaning local sports networks like SportsNet LA will not carry the broadcast. This situation has caused some frustration for local fans who subscribe to the team's dedicated channel. The arrangement mirrors a similar exclusive broadcast in 2022 when Albert Pujols hit his 700th career home run on an Apple TV+ game.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually.

The tax break, part of a bill passed in July, applies from 2025 through 2028 and phases out for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income over $150,000.

This information, cited from sources, is still considered speculative, and an official offer might come later than initially anticipated. The news caused Warner Bros. Discovery shares to rise by approximately 1.5% to around $19 per share. A successful acquisition would create a massive media conglomerate, combining two major film studios and extensive portfolios of television networks and sports rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese shipping company SeaLegend Line has launched a new "Arctic express" service from China to Europe, marking a growing commercial interest in the Northern Sea Route. The vessel is transporting time-sensitive and high-value goods, such as e-commerce parcels and power batteries, aiming to offer a transit time that is faster than traditional sea routes via the Suez Canal but cheaper than rail. The route connects Qingdao to ports in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. This development reflects China's increasing use of the Arctic passage as a viable alternative for shipping to Europe.</p>
