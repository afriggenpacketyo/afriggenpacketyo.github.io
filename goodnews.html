          <p>The Secret Service questioned former FBI Director James Comey about an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some Trump administration officials interpreted as a call for the former president's assassination.

Trump, who has been the target of assassination attempts, said Comey knew exactly what the post meant and was calling for his death. The incident highlights ongoing tensions between Comey and Trump, dating back to Comey's firing during the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for much of the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust significantly reduced visibility. The National Weather Service confirmed it was only the second time in its history that it had issued a dust storm warning. The storm was caused by strong winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust and carrying it through the region. The dust storm prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports and caused near-zero visibility on several interstates.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key negotiating points. The EU is seeking a new "youth mobility scheme," but concerns exist about the impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are also a sticking point, with the EU calling for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal and UK fishing groups seeking changes. A UK/EU youth mobility scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, and the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.</p>

          <p>A passenger, Catherine Snowdon, traveled on a British Airways flight to Madrid under the wrong identity, with her boarding pass displaying the name of a man named Huw H. The discrepancy was not detected at check-in or at the boarding gate. Upon arrival in Madrid, Snowdon discovered her return flight had been cancelled because British Airways believed she had not traveled on the outbound flight. The airline offered a goodwill voucher and refunded the cost of the extra ticket.</p>
