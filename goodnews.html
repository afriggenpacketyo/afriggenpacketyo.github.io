While Kuiper has a significantly smaller number of satellites in orbit compared to Starlink, Amazon aims to deploy thousands more by 2029. The burgeoning low Earth orbit satellite market is attracting substantial investment, with projections of 70,000 satellites by 2031, driven by the potential for 6G communications and providing internet access to underserved populations globally.

          <p>A four-year-old mystery surrounding a wedding crasher at a couple's Ayrshire wedding has finally been solved. Michelle and John Wylie discovered a stranger in their wedding photos and, despite extensive inquiries, could not identify him until an internet sleuth intervened. The man, Andrew Hillhouse, was revealed to have accidentally attended the wrong wedding, mistaking it for another event two miles away. He realized his error only when the bride walked down the aisle but felt committed to staying, leading to his appearance in the couple's cherished memories.</p>

          <p>On "The Wayne Rooney Show," Wayne Rooney recalled the infamous 6-1 Manchester derby defeat in 2011, describing it as a "horrible" experience that felt like "goal after goal." He humorously admitted he should have canceled his birthday party that night, which was attended by both United and City players, including Joe Hart and Gareth Barry. Rooney also discussed his iconic overhead kick in a 2011 derby, which he scored despite playing poorly, and highlighted his first Premier League title win in 2007 as his favorite derby memory.</p>

          <p>California's Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and enable high-density housing near public transit. The legislation, championed by Senator Scott Wiener, allows for buildings up to nine stories near certain transit stops, impacting single-family neighborhoods. Supporters argue drastic measures are needed for the state's affordability crisis, while critics call it an overreach that strips local control. The bill's passage was bolstered by an agreement with a powerful labor group, adding union hiring provisions to certain projects.</p>

The author argues that with the United Nations increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, and the marginalization of the Global South, new governance approaches are urgently needed. The SCO, embodying principles of cooperation among diverse cultures and political systems, provides a platform for states to address global fragmentation.
