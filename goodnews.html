          <p>A significant heat wave is forecast to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with potential daily record highs expected in parts of the Rockies and Plains before the heat shifts to the Midwest, mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Temperatures are predicted to reach well into the 90s or even triple digits, with high humidity exacerbating the effects, and officials are urging residents to stay indoors with air conditioning and take precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are proposing a ¬£10,000 bonus for new army recruits to boost troop numbers amid concerns about global instability. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Lib Dems, emphasized the need for the UK to be better prepared given the threats posed by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. The plan aims to increase the number of trained soldiers from just under 71,000 to more than 73,000. The Lib Dems also suggest distributing pamphlets to every British home to ensure war readiness and the scheme would be limited to 3,000 personnel, costing ¬£60m from the defence budget.</p>

This action is part of a global movement to return the human remains of indigenous peoples taken abroad for research.
