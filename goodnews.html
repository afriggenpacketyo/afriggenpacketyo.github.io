          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will originate from India to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company is also shifting production of iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods to Vietnam for the U.S. market. While Apple's sales in China have decreased, Cook affirmed that China will remain the primary manufacturing location for products sold outside the U.S. Overall, Apple reported increases in earnings and revenue, driven by strong iPhone demand in other regions. </p>

          <p>Santa Cruz, California, has implemented a new soda tax of 2 cents per ounce on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. This move positions Santa Cruz as the first city to introduce a new soda tax since the ban was enacted in 2018. Proponents of the tax framed it as a stand against the American Beverage Association, while opponents argue it burdens working families already facing high prices.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme, the cat from Newquay Zoo has been moved to Germany's Black Forest where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. While thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests, efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.</p>
