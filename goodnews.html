          <p>Stable Recovery, a free residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation program at Kentucky's Taylor Made Farm, provides a unique path to healing by integrating horse care into the recovery process. Roughly 50 men, many with histories of homelessness and incarceration, work with thoroughbred horses, gaining structure, purpose, and meaningful career training in the horse industry. Co-founders Christian Countzler and Frank Taylor, both in recovery, attest to the profound bond between "broken people" and horses as a powerful therapeutic tool. This article celebrates the program's high success rate, with 22 of its 25 graduates maintaining sobriety and employment, and notes its recent expansion to include a women's house, showcasing a transformative approach to addiction.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant deal with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower drug prices in the United States to match rates charged in other developed countries. Pfizer also agreed to participate in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted drugs directly to consumers. This article highlights Trump's long-standing push to reduce drug costs, a goal he largely failed to achieve in his first term, and how he leveraged the threat of 100% tariffs on imported drugs as a "powerful tool" to secure this concession. While the immediate financial relief for all Americans remains unclear, particularly for existing drugs, this agreement marks a symbolic victory against the drug industry's previously united front and may set a precedent for other pharmaceutical companies.

          <h2>The Controversial Origins and Evolution of College Rankings</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>College rankings, now a pervasive and influential aspect of higher education, originated as a "shocking experiment" in 1934 with Edwin Embree's informal list of "greatest universities." This article traces their controversial history, from initial attempts like Kendric Babcock's 1911 study that was suppressed due to public and institutional backlash, to the eventual dominance of U.S. News & World Report's lists in the 1980s. It details how rankings evolved from subjective measures of "eminence" to more statistical analyses, driven by institutional anxiety, consumer demand, and the appeal of controversy. The article also highlights how universities have subsequently adapted to and, in some cases, actively gamed these metrics to enhance their perceived standing in an increasingly competitive academic environment.</p>

Far from collapsing, China is actively restructuring its economy, with this technically trained and innovation-driven cohort leading the charge. Many of these business leaders, who came of age during China's reform era, originate from provinces with strong business cultures and effectively blend their experiences of past scarcity with emerging market and technological opportunities. This article posits that these entrepreneurial forces are crucial to China's resilience, driving competitiveness at scale and ensuring its continued integration into global systems, thereby reshaping its economic future.</p>

          <p>A team of divers from a shipwreck salvage company has unearthed over 1,000 silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, off Florida's aptly named "treasure coast." This remarkable fortune originates from a Spanish fleet that was tragically wrecked by a hurricane on July 31, 1715, scattering its precious cargo across the seabed. This article highlights the significant historical value of the find, noting that visible dates and mint marks on the recovered coins offer valuable insights for historians and collectors alike. Salvage company officials describe the discovery of such a large quantity of coins in a single recovery as both rare and extraordinary, providing a tangible link to the "golden age of the Spanish empire."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, highlighting its profound role as a practice of survival and care for enslaved Africans in Cuba. It emphasizes how Lucumí fosters character, balance, and connection to the divine through orishas, serving as an act of resistance against white supremacy and forced conversion. The article actively works to destigmatize the religion, addressing pervasive misconceptions like "witchcraft" and sensationalized views of animal sacrifice, explaining that rituals are prayerful, respectful, and often involve sharing meat with the community. Scholars argue that the historical vilification of Lucumí was a strategic tool to justify colonial oppression and demonize non-Christian, African-derived practices.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the widely utilized FICO credit score, experienced a significant stock surge of over 20% following its announcement of a new pricing model. This model allows mortgage lenders to directly license FICO scores, effectively bypassing traditional credit bureaus. The strategic shift aims to eliminate "unnecessary mark-ups" and offer lenders greater choice in both pricing and distribution models, which is expected to improve FICO's financial performance. This article highlights that while FICO's shares rallied, major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax saw their stocks fall, reflecting investor anticipation of their disintermediation. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte lauded the move as a "creative solution" to foster a safer, stronger, and more competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article contends that Democrats are employing more extensive, albeit often under-the-radar, resistance strategies against the Trump administration than their frustrated voters realize. Their approach leverages procedural powers in Congress, including filibusters, blanket "holds" on nominations, and forced roll call votes, to delay and obstruct the administration's legislative agenda and appointments. Crucially, a highly effective legal strategy outside of Congress, involving hundreds of lawsuits, has successfully blocked, reversed, or significantly delayed many of Trump's executive actions. This article highlights the disconnect between these procedural and legal efforts and the intense pressure from a Democratic base that perceives their party as "weak" or "ineffective," particularly during the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has successfully completed a $6.6 billion secondary share sale, allowing current and former employees to sell stock at a staggering $500 billion valuation. This transaction, which saw approximately two-thirds of the authorized shares change hands, firmly establishes OpenAI as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. This article highlights strong investor confidence in OpenAI's long-term prospects, even at this elevated valuation, and underscores the company's strategic use of secondary sales to retain top AI talent amidst intensifying industry competition. This approach enables employees to monetize their equity while the company remains private, deferring a traditional initial public offering. (not investment advice)</p>
