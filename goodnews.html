          <p>South Korea's central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, primarily due to concerns over household debt. This decision aligns with economist expectations and follows new, stricter property regulations in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. While inflation remains stable and economic growth outlook improves, uncertainties from ongoing US trade talks and potential tariff impacts pose risks. The Bank of Korea monitors housing market stability and household debt, with analysts suggesting a possible rate cut in November if trade and housing policies progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former official policy adviser has urged China to avoid falling into Western "discourse traps" on issues like state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. He emphasized the need for China to confidently defend the Communist Party's rule and challenge perceived "double standards" regarding its rise. While acknowledging China's significant achievements, the adviser noted that Western media often interprets these differently, leading to intense resistance from China. He warned that the current confrontational approach might not only fail to convince Western societies but also risk a backlash among Global South countries.</p>

          <h2>California's Proposition 50 Special Election Sees Unexpectedly High Voter Turnout</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's special election on Proposition 50, a Democratic-led effort to redraw congressional districts, is experiencing unexpectedly high early voter turnout. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, comparable to a presidential election year, with Democrats significantly outpacing Republicans. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed the proposition, highlight its importance for national democracy against partisan gerrymandering. Despite concerns from some Republicans about potential voter suppression tactics, the strong early Democratic showing suggests an advantage for Proposition 50's passage, aiming to counter efforts to entrench power.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are making strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells." These cells, which can break away from a primary tumor and later cause cancer to spread, were identified in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had an aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer. A clinical trial successfully used drugs to eliminate these cells, with only two out of 51 participants experiencing recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. The next step involves larger trials and exploring applicability to other cancers, offering new hope.</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island. The mother, father, and son spent almost two days sheltering in a barn on Naushon Island before the son managed to use the boat’s washed-up marine radio to make a mayday call. A relative alerted authorities when the family didn't return as expected. The family was flown to a hospital, with one member in critical condition, highlighting the importance of quick thinking and quality safety equipment in survival situations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:19:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Menopause screening will be officially incorporated into NHS health checks in England starting next year, for women aged 40 to 74. The initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice and support, including treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or counselling, thereby bringing menopause into mainstream health discussions. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes this will improve support, as many women suffer in silence due to lack of information and stigma. Campaigners welcome the move but emphasize the need for staff training and improved uptake of health checks, particularly in marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Helen Ledwick, a former BBC journalist, is raising awareness about pelvic organ prolapse, a common but often taboo condition she experienced two weeks after her second childbirth. Prolapse occurs when pelvic organs slip from their position, causing physical and emotional distress, yet many women and health professionals lack awareness. Ledwick felt isolated and received unhelpful initial advice, leading her to launch a podcast and write a book to break the silence. Women's health specialists confirm the prevalence of such issues, emphasizing that symptoms can vary and can be improved through exercises or medical treatment.</p>

The article notes the song's striking relevance to current US issues, particularly ICE raids and unaccounted detained persons, urging communities to stand proud of their roots.</p>
