          <p>The U.S. has brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, aiming to end the conflict in eastern DRC over its vast mineral wealth. The agreement, set to be signed in Washington, seeks to end fighting and attract American investment in the region's resources, including coltan, cobalt, and gold. However, the deal's success hinges on the cooperation of the M23 rebel group, which is not a signatory and believed to be backed by Rwanda. The U.S. aims to secure access to critical resources and counter China's dominance in Africa's mineral sector through this transactional approach.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the importance of public pools for mental, physical, and social health, highlighting their ability to boost moods and provide a sense of community. Public pools have historically served as "third places" for people to gather, but desegregation led to the decline of many public pools as suburbanites retreated to private clubs. The author advocates for reinvesting in public pools to provide accessible recreation for everyone. Public pools offer a chance to find transcendence in the everyday, and are essential for the health, happiness, efficiency, and orderliness of a large number of the city‚Äôs residents, especially in the summer months.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban the supply of plastic wet wipes to consumers starting in December 2026, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The move aims to reduce environmental harm caused by plastic and microplastic pollution, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business supplies. Research indicates that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment, with substantial quantities entering river systems. The ban is supported across party lines and includes an 18-month transition period for manufacturers to adapt.</p>

These shrines honor spirits' claim to the land, providing them a place to dwell, and the red soda serves as a replacement for blood offerings. Spirits, like humans, have a sweet tooth, making the sickly sweetness of the soda appealing. The tradition originates from animism mixed with Brahmanism, with the offerings intended to ensure protection and good fortune. The presence of red Fanta in Thai groceries serves as a reminder of the cultural and spiritual significance interwoven into daily life.</p>

          <p>Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, is leading the city's response to increased immigration enforcement and protests. As the Trump administration targets Los Angeles, Bass has denounced the actions and emphasized the importance of immigrants to the city. Bass's leadership is being tested as she navigates the crisis, balancing the needs of the city's immigrant population with the need to maintain order. She has also had to confront some of those taking to the streets, demanding that protests be ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù and responding sharply to anti-Ice graffiti on downtown buildings and businesses.</p>

          <p>Mark Walter, the chairman of Guggenheim Partners, is set to become the new majority owner of the Lakers. Walter transformed the Dodgers into a juggernaut in Major League Baseball. Walter is committed to the city of Los Angeles in various ways. He is going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year, and make sure the city feels proud of the Lakers and the legacy that they‚Äôve already built with the Buss family.</p>
