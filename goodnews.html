          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his third start of the season, Ohtani's fastball reached a career-high 101.7 mph, though he remained hitless in four at-bats. Despite his strong pitching performance, which included one strikeout and allowing only a single and a walk, the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive domestic policy package narrowly cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate, advancing after a tense and prolonged vote. The measure passed 51-49 only after several Republican holdouts reversed their opposition, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The successful vote sets the stage for a final debate and vote on the controversial 940-page bill, which still faces significant opposition from Democrats and uncertainty in the House.

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to voluntarily encourage customers to make healthier choices. Under the partnership, retailers will decide on methods such as offering promotions on healthy food, adjusting loyalty point systems, or reformulating products. The initiative, part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, aims to tackle rising obesity rates and reduce pressure on the health service by making nutritious options more accessible and appealing.

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to simulate Olympic conditions and build resilience to unfamiliar environments. The initiative aims to foster a stronger team spirit and help swimmers, like silver medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, perform at their peak even when facing challenges like shared living quarters and travel logistics.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Why Cities Experience Higher Temperatures During Heatwaves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "urban heat island" effect is the key reason why cities often feel significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, especially during heatwaves. This phenomenon occurs because dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, which is then slowly released, raising air temperatures. The lack of vegetation and water, combined with waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, exacerbates the effect, making urban populations more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and extreme heat.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, as experts warn that sunburn in childhood significantly increases later risk. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, health charities and dermatologists emphasize that early education is a key preventative measure.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, bringing a close to the vehicle's 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program.

Having achieved a 98% success rate over its lifetime, the H2A series is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, positioning Japan for the competitive commercial satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and sending a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The event, which organizers framed as a celebration of human rights, drew a much larger crowd than in previous years, with many attendees motivated by the government's attempt to suppress it. The ban was based on a controversial "Child Protection" law, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled the march to proceed as a council-organized event.</p>
