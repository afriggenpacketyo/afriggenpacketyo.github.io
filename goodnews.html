          <p>Carvana reported record first-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street expectations with a 46% increase in year-over-year sales, reaching nearly 134,000 units. The online used vehicle retailer's revenue soared to $4.23 billion, a 38% increase from the previous year, and it also achieved record net income of $373 million. CEO Ernie Garcia addressed potential tariff impacts, downplaying significant effects on the business. The company anticipates that changes in new vehicle prices could positively influence used car sales, but the overall net effect remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that the U.S. is nearing trade agreements, potentially announcing a "major trade deal" with the United Kingdom, which could be the first of several agreements with countries like Canada, Italy, India, and Japan. Negotiations are ongoing as businesses and investors seek clarity amid existing tariffs, including a 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods and high tariffs on Chinese imports. Experts suggest that while some countries may quickly comply with U.S. demands, comprehensive deals could take longer to finalize due to long-term implications.</p>

          <p>Following the death of international relations scholar Joseph Nye, known for the concept of "soft power," Chinese scholars have expressed cautious views on his intellectual legacy. While Nye's idea of soft power was widely praised and adopted in China, scholars suggest his policy influence was limited, and his attitude towards China wasn't as friendly as some believed. Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have emphasized soft power, incorporating values and culture to influence others and gain consent, in contrast to hard power.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including Tom Brady and Stephen Curry. The judge ruled that plaintiffs failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the platform. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in 2022, which resulted in billions of dollars in losses for customers. The ruling narrows the scope of the multidistrict litigation accusing the celebrities of promoting a fraudulent platform.</p>
