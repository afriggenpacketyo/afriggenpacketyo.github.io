        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially taken effect, reducing tariffs on British cars and aerospace exports. In exchange, the UK has eliminated tariffs on American beef and ethanol, a move criticized by Britain's domestic bioethanol industry. However, the deal leaves a significant issue unresolved, as a 25% US tariff on UK steel and aluminum remains in place. This tariff could potentially double to 50% if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline, creating major uncertainty for UK steel producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) experienced a dramatic resurgence in the first half of 2025, with funds raised soaring eightfold to US$13.5 billion. This performance propelled the city's stock exchange to the top of global rankings for the first time since 2019, surpassing both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts attribute the rebound to renewed international investor confidence and significant capital inflows from mainland China. The strong post-listing performance of newly offered stocks has further fueled the market's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the second Trump administration is successfully implementing a coherent grand strategy centered on American interests and 'peace through strength.' The author argues that this approach has created new opportunities for trade and cooperation in the Middle East while effectively isolating Iran. The article presents strategic military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities as calculated actions that simultaneously supported allies like Israel and demonstrated a preference for diplomacy, which was pursued immediately after. It contends these actions counter characterizations of the administration as either isolationist or warmongering.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to drive voter engagement and rebuild support following losses in 2024. The program will focus on registering voters and connecting with communities through non-traditional channels like book clubs and social media platforms. With an initial six-figure investment, the effort aims to deploy thousands of volunteers in key districts and states. This grassroots strategy is designed to gather feedback directly from voters and build momentum for the crucial 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>This story recounts the lasting impact of a simple, kind gesture from over thirty years ago. In 1990, Karen de Boer, a college freshman, overslept and missed the bus for a crucial performance with her school's prestigious choir, fearing it would end her choral career. Her neighbor, Pam, with whom she had a rocky relationship due to her own noisy behavior, offered to drive her an hour to the church without hesitation. De Boer reflects on this act not just as a ride, but as a profound gift of forgiveness that has influenced her for decades.</p>

Their reunion was organized by the USC Shoah Foundation, which is racing to record firsthand testimonies as the number of living survivors and witnesses dwindles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those wondering how to support a friend with cancer, survivors and advocates offer key advice, emphasizing presence over platitudes. The most important step is to reach out, as social isolation can be more painful than the treatment itself. Instead of talking, it is better to ask if the person wants to discuss their situation and then simply listen without offering comparisons or unsolicited advice. When offering help, be specific with suggestions like dropping off a particular meal, rather than making a vague offer that puts the burden on the patient to ask for assistance.</p>

          <p>Homicide rates across the United States are falling dramatically, with analyses showing a drop of at least 14% in 2024 and further declines expected in 2025. While policing tactics can play a role, researchers point to a broader primary driver: the societal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. They argue that the 2020 crime surge was linked to the shutdown of public services like schools, community centers, and mental health providers. As local government employment and spending have returned to pre-pandemic levels, these vital support systems for at-risk youth have been restored, helping to interrupt cycles of violence.</p>

While this marks significant progress and allows couples access to some public services like housing, the certificates are not legally binding. Japan remains the only G7 nation that has not legalized same-sex marriage.

          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has set his sights on winning the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat achieved by only five of the last thirty wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born wrestler to reach the sport's highest rank since 2017, adding to the pressure and attention surrounding his performance. Following a meteoric rise through the ranks in just 13 tournaments, Onosato hopes a strong showing in Nagoya will energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was hit by a major earthquake earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The final qualifying for the 153rd Open Championship features several compelling storylines as 288 players compete for just 20 spots. Ryder Cup veteran Ian Poulter is notably competing in the same tournament as his 21-year-old son, Luke, with either potentially knocking the other out of contention. Other prominent players from the LIV tour, such as Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood, are also making last-ditch efforts to qualify for the major at Royal Portrush. The high-stakes, 36-hole events across four UK courses highlight the raw drama of earning a place in golf's oldest championship.</p>

          <h2>Japan Welcomes China's Lifting of Blanket Ban on Seafood Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 02:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has described China's decision to lift its blanket import ban on Japanese seafood as a "positive" development. The comprehensive ban was first implemented in August 2023 in response to the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. While welcoming the move, a Japanese government spokesman stated that they will continue to press China to remove the remaining import restrictions. These ongoing bans still affect fisheries products from ten prefectures, including Fukushima, and have been in place since the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky has been freed after spending five years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, for challenging authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Released as part of a deal involving a rare US diplomatic visit, Tikhanovsky described the psychological toll of total isolation and his emotional reunion with his family. He was a prominent blogger whose attempt to run for president in 2020 led to his arrest and sparked mass protests led by his wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. He vowed to continue fighting for a democratic Belarus and the release of over 1,000 other political prisoners.</p>

          <h2>Family Wins Full Refund for No-Snow Lapland Holiday from Tour Operator TUI</h2>

          <p>A family from Cumbria has won a six-month battle for a ¬£3,500 refund from tour operator TUI after their "dream" trip to Lapland was ruined by a lack of snow. The family had booked the trip for its snow-based activities, but none could proceed due to unseasonable rain. An independent adjudicator ruled that the essential purpose of the holiday was defeated and that TUI had failed to comply with its own "no snow you don't have to go" policy. The family's successful appeal resulted in full compensation, setting a positive precedent for consumer rights.</p>
