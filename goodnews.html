Norm's entrance into the bar and his truthful, witty responses to the question of how he was doing were celebrated for their genuine quality. The author argues that Norm's willingness to be humble and admit to struggle, coupled with his strong connections with the bar's patrons, made him an inspiration in a world often filled with superficial interactions. The article suggests that Norm's example encourages a deeper connection with others by caring about their well-being from the start.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has been exemplary in cleaning up its streams, by some measures, more than any other state. A big part of the solution was simple: Give cows clean drinking water and keep them out of the streams. One farmer, Grant Victor, decided to fence his cattle off from Horse Creek, which wends through northeast Oklahoma, bisecting his family‚Äôs pastures and cropland. Today, Horse Creek is no longer on the state‚Äôs list of most contaminated waterways. And, thanks to practices such as the ones enacted by Mr. Victor, about 100 Oklahoman streams once polluted by runoff predominantly from farmland have been restored to health. That‚Äôs more than in any other state, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland. The appointment has been met with enthusiasm from metalheads, given Finland's status as a heavy metal capital. Lim's selection is based on his human rights work and international experience, including his service as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Chthonic has used its music to call attention to the struggles of Taiwan.</p>

          <h2>Keir Starmer Announces U-Turn on Winter Fuel Payment Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 16:19:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, reversing an earlier decision following political pressure. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments after the pension top-up became means-tested last year. The threshold will be changed to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again, though it remains unclear how many will regain their entitlement. The policy will be changed at the autumn Budget, with decisions made based on affordability.</p>
