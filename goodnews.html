          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced a significant 67% increase in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, reaching 19.53 billion Danish kroner. The company's overall revenues grew by 13% year-on-year, narrowly beating forecasts, though net profit slightly missed analyst expectations. Following a recent cut in its full-year guidance due to weaker U.S. sales forecasts, Novo Nordisk has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and enhance its commercial focus. The company's incoming CEO has emphasized a sense of urgency and a determination to aim for higher performance amidst recent stock declines. (not investment advice)</p>

Wilson, known for co-founding the Transit Riders Union, is running on a platform of progressive policies and has pledged to "Trump-proof" the city. Harrell, the establishment candidate, is defending his record on issues like affordable housing and public safety. The race highlights a clash between progressive activism and the city's political establishment, with Wilson aiming to become the first challenger to unseat a Seattle mayor in two decades.</p>

          <p>China's initiative to manage high levels of local government debt has seen its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a list of high-risk jurisdictions. The region was one of twelve province-level areas flagged by Beijing for concerning debt levels, which had previously led to the cancellation of major infrastructure projects. This development was revealed in a local budget review, which emphasized the need to consolidate this progress and continue debt resolution efforts. The achievement marks a significant step in Beijing's broader campaign, launched in 2023, to control and restructure debt in its most financially strained regions.</p>

          <p>The difficulty for crossover athletes to succeed in the NFL is highlighted by Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit's recent decision to end his 18-month pursuit of an American football career. Experts point to several major obstacles, including the immense complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar. Another challenge is the sheer depth of athletic talent in the U.S., particularly for "skill positions" like running back and wide receiver. While physically gifted, athletes like Rees-Zammit face a steep learning curve in "football IQ" and must compete against hundreds of players who have grown up with the sport's intricacies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is actively strengthening its trade relationships with Africa's leading coffee-producing nations to secure new supply chains for the booming domestic market. This strategic push is influenced by a surge in coffee consumption in China and a zero-tariff policy on certain African goods, creating a favorable import environment. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading the effort, signing agreements in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to invest in local coffee industries and procure large quantities of beans. Analysts suggest this move allows China to "lock in supply" by leveraging its growing market power and taking advantage of global trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has expressed confidence that the intense Formula 1 title fight between his drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will not lead to a serious falling out. Acknowledging that the teammates will likely "swap paint again," Brown believes their mutual respect, trust, and open communication will prevent their rivalry from turning bitter. With Norris and Piastri having won 11 of the season's 14 races, Brown anticipates the competitive tension will grow but is positive they will not deliberately run each other off the track. The team plans to proactively manage the relationship, recognizing the importance of their long-term partnership for McLaren's continued success.</p>

          <h2>Venezuelan Teenager's Two Goals Lead LAFC to Victory, Pushing Tigres to Near Elimination in Leagues Cup</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan David Martínez scored twice to lead Los Angeles FC to a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in a Leagues Cup match, leaving the Mexican club on the verge of elimination. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty in the 38th minute and, after Tigres equalized, secured the win with a skillful individual effort in the second half. The result severely damages Tigres' chances of advancing, as their progression now depends on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the win, LAFC's own path to the next round remains highly improbable, as they also have insufficient points to likely qualify.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return from the injured list, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 12-6 victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy's performance provided a much-needed spark for the Dodgers' offense, which had struggled significantly during the month he was sidelined with a knee injury. His comeback is seen as a crucial boost, akin to a major trade deadline acquisition, for a team that had been in a midseason slump. The game also saw positive offensive contributions from other key players, suggesting the lineup may be returning to form.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Indiana Fever 100-91, continuing their recent strong performance by winning their seventh game in eight outings.

The victory moves the Sparks, who are finally at full roster strength after a year of injuries, closer to a playoff position as they build crucial team chemistry.</p>

          <p>As the number of living survivors, or "hibakusha," of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki dwindles, a new generation is taking on the responsibility of preserving their first-hand accounts. With the average survivor now over 86 years old, individuals and organizations are working to ensure the horrors of nuclear war are not forgotten. The article highlights the work of a 12-year-old "successor" in Hiroshima who guides foreign tourists, sharing his great-grandmother's story and the detailed history of the attack to spread a message of peace. These efforts are seen as crucial to conveying the reality of the bombings to future generations amid rising global nuclear tensions.</p>

          <h2>California to Close Norco State Prison in 2026 Amid Declining Inmate Population</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 22:27:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 3,000 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will see its population transferred to other prisons, with efforts made to reassign employees. The site itself has a unique history, having originally opened as a luxury resort in 1928, and local officials are hopeful it can be redeveloped to restore its former glory.</p>
