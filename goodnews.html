          <p>The Rodon Group, a plastics injection molding company in Pennsylvania, is experiencing a surge in business due to the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. As companies scramble to navigate the changing tariff landscape, demand for Rodon's products, including K'nex toy sets, has increased by nearly 50%. While a U.S. agreement with China aims to reduce tariffs, uncertainty remains due to ongoing trade tensions and legal challenges. The Rodon Group has avoided tariff-related disruptions by investing in automation, enabling them to compete with overseas manufacturers. CEO Michael Araten emphasizes the importance of investing in STEM education to support domestic production. The stability of the industry is somewhat dependent on the future of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized Alabama's National Guard to protect civil rights advocates marching from Selma to Montgomery, a move reminiscent of President Trump's recent federalization of the California National Guard amidst immigration protests. Johnson's decision came after Alabama Governor George Wallace refused to ensure the safety of the activists. This action, though rare, was taken to enforce federal laws and prevent domestic violence, highlighting the historical use of presidential power in civil rights crises. The events of 1965 serve as a precedent for understanding the complexities of federal-state relations during times of social unrest.</p>
