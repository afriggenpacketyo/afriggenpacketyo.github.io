          <p>Queen Sirikit, the revered mother of Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn and the consort of the nation's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, has passed away peacefully at the age of 93 in a Bangkok hospital. She had been hospitalized since 2019, battling several illnesses, including a recent blood infection. For over six decades, Queen Sirikit was a prominent figure, known for her extensive international travels with King Bhumibol and her frequent appearances on global best-dressed lists in the 1960s. Her birthday was annually observed as Mother's Day in Thailand, underscoring her profound and enduring maternal role for the country.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen demonstrated dominant form by topping Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, securing the fastest time ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. In contrast, championship rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri of McLaren experienced a challenging day, with Piastri notably lagging more than 0.5 seconds behind Norris on long runs and ending up 12th fastest overall. Verstappen, despite reporting his car felt like "driving on ice" due to a lack of grip, maintained his lead. The session proceeded without major incidents, though Williams driver Alex Albon briefly brushed a wall on his qualifying simulation lap.</p>

          <p>As clocks move back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern UK regions experiencing barely six hours of daylight, over a million people are affected by Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Symptoms include low mood, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, exacerbated by limited access to social and medical support in rural areas. Professor Hester Parr, leading the 'Living with Sad' project, advocates for proactive coping strategies, such as developing "light routines" and creating cozy indoor environments. Orkney islanders are now piloting a "Wintering Well" program, distributing therapeutic lamps and activity guides from libraries to promote mental health and encourage engaging with winter outdoors.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against reducing the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, arguing it would be counterproductive. The Treasury Select Committee concluded that such cuts are unlikely to effectively foster an investment culture in the UK, given the current financial landscape. With the Chancellor facing an estimated £22bn budget shortfall, changes to ISAs were reportedly considered to incentivize shifting savings into stocks and shares. However, the committee emphasized that the UK is "a long way from that point" where such a measure would be appropriate, underscoring the widespread reliance on cash ISAs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges Over Necessity of Manual Driving Skills Amid Rise of Automatics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing debate questions the necessity of learning to drive a manual car as automatic vehicles now constitute one in three cars on UK roads, a trend accelerated by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. While passing a manual test offers the freedom to drive any vehicle, many aspiring drivers struggle with limited access to automatic instructors or the higher cost of automatic lessons. Despite a higher pass rate for manual tests, young drivers weigh the perceived ease and future relevance of automatics against the traditional manual license. Experts predict a gradual shift in instructor availability as electric vehicle prices decrease.</p>

          <p>Counting is now underway in the Irish presidential election, where voters cast ballots to elect the nation's 10th president, succeeding Michael D. Higgins. The race primarily features two contenders: Catherine Connolly, an independent politician backed by left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys, the Fine Gael candidate. Early unofficial indications suggest that voter turnout might struggle to surpass the record low of just under 40% recorded in the previous 2018 presidential election. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew from the campaign due to controversy, but his name remained on the ballot, with any votes for him to be transferred to the other candidates.</p>

          <p>Magnesium is being hailed as a "miracle mineral" for its purported benefits in sleep, digestion, and mental health, fueling a rapidly expanding global supplement market. However, health experts, including dietitians, caution that while magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, supplements are primarily effective only if an individual is genuinely deficient. They emphasize that strong scientific evidence often lacks to support the broad claims for various magnesium compounds promoted on social media. Experts recommend addressing potential deficiencies through diet first and advising caution with supplements, as excessive intake can lead to adverse effects, especially for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has mandated that the University of California publicly release the Trump administration's $1.2 billion settlement proposal, marking a significant victory for UCLA faculty advocating for transparency. The 28-page document details extensive federal demands for policy changes at UCLA, following accusations of mishandling antisemitism complaints, admissions practices, and gender identity issues. UC had argued that public disclosure would jeopardize negotiations and future settlements, but faculty successfully contended that the information is of paramount public interest. The controversial proposal includes demands such as preventing "anti-Western" international students and banning gender-affirming healthcare for minors at UCLA medical facilities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Jaime Moore, a 30-year veteran and current deputy chief, as the new head of the embattled Los Angeles Fire Department. Moore, known for his "progressive" leadership and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, is tasked with implementing reforms and preparing the department for significant events like the Olympics. His appointment comes at a critical time, following the mayor's ousting of the previous chief after the Palisades fire and an ongoing federal probe into the city's disaster response. While the union welcomed Moore, it also highlighted the LAFD's status as the most "under-resourced" fire department in the country.</p>
