          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but with new restrictions limiting its use to older adults and individuals with pre-existing conditions that increase their risk from COVID-19. This decision, detailed in the New York Times article, reflects growing skepticism towards vaccines and requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, potentially costing the company millions. Experts express concerns that these limitations may reduce vaccine accessibility and options for those seeking it for various reasons, including protecting vulnerable family members. The move marks a departure from previous norms where the CDC typically determined vaccine eligibility, leading to confusion and criticism regarding the FDA's motives.</p>
