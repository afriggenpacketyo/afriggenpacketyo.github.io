          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has encouraged the use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters redirect their sales to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs, similar to international ones, serve as a guarantee of payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can be used for both physical goods and services, with a payment period generally set at one year, providing a financial tool for businesses adjusting to trade war dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Brit School in Croydon has been awarded government funding to address building conditions, including a ceiling collapse that forced the closure of classrooms. The funding, part of a ¬£470m Condition Improvement Fund (CIF) package, will support the replacement of the main building roof and fire safety works. The school, known for its famous alumni, houses five buildings dating from 1909 to 2012, some of which face regular repair challenges.

          <p>India is seeking to tap into its rare earth reserves in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, aiming to become an alternative supplier for countries like the U.S. Indian officials are considering how to leverage India Rare Earths to increase rare earth magnet production, following China's pause in exports, which has affected manufacturers across various countries. Experts suggest that India could deepen collaboration with the U.S. on critical minerals to enhance future economic competitiveness. While China has signaled plans to ease controls, it still dominates the rare earth elements market, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior market strategist and head of research at the World Gold Council, John Reade, stated that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, are not an alternative to gold and do not threaten its role as a safe-haven investment. Reade pointed out that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasized that these digital assets do not pose any risks or comparison to gold, wishing proponents would stop marketing them as "gold 2.0." His comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies continues to grow, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar.
