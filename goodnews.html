          <h2>New Fossil Evidence Suggests Dinosaurs Were Thriving in North America Before Asteroid Impact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of fossils in New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America just before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. Researchers accurately dated fossils of species like Tyrannosaurus rex and the massive Alamosaurus to within 400,000 years of the asteroid strike. This finding challenges the long-held theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. However, some independent experts caution that evidence from a single location may not represent a complete global picture of dinosaur populations at the time.</p>

          <p>England's starting goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, will miss the upcoming friendly match against Brazil due to an elbow injury. Her absence guarantees a debut for one of the backup goalkeepers, either Khiara Keating or Anna Moorhouse. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that while the injury is not major, it presents an opportunity to test other players in the squad. The match is part of a homecoming series for the Lionesses to celebrate their recent Euro 2025 victory and begin preparations for the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble exceeded Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. Despite the positive results, the company reported flat sales volume, indicating that consumer demand is waning for some products as shoppers become more price-conscious. P&G's CFO noted that while the consumer environment is stable, shoppers are stretching their budgets by using products to the last drop. The company reiterated its full-year forecast but acknowledged the challenging economic and geopolitical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Volunteers organized patrols, offered to help children of undocumented workers, and held demonstrations to show solidarity. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between federal immigration policies and the stance of sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>This article explores how the concept of "aliens" has evolved in popular culture, from the little green men of the 1950s to modern interpretations in film and technology. Social scientist Christian Peters explains how these depictions often reflect prevailing societal anxieties, such as Cold War paranoia, corporate greed, and fears of the unknown. The term "alien" itself has historical roots in describing foreigners, and its use in immigration debates highlights themes of otherness and exclusion. The discussion extends to artificial intelligence, which some experts describe as a form of "alien intelligence" that is reshaping human existence.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool Manager Arne Slot Expresses Confidence in Mohamed Salah Amid Scoring Slump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has affirmed that he is not concerned about star winger Mohamed Salah's recent dip in goal-scoring form. Despite being the team's top scorer last season, Salah has only scored three league goals this term, and his longest-ever Premier League streak without a non-penalty goal continues. Slot attributed the slump to the normal fluctuations in a player's performance and adjustments to new teammates following a summer of significant spending on attacking players. He expressed full confidence that Salah, who has been a prolific scorer throughout his career, will soon return to form.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece frames the recent jewel theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris as a surprisingly lighthearted and captivating crime. The author argues that the non-violent heist, carried out by seemingly amateur burglars who escaped on mopeds, is a welcome distraction from more grim news cycles. The article suggests that such thefts often increase the fame and public interest in the stolen items, making art and history more accessible, albeit unconventionally. In a world of serious threats, the author finds a certain charm and democratic appeal in a well-executed, harmless caper.</p>

Strong investment returns, particularly from successful bets on technology, artificial intelligence, and rising M&A activity, also contributed significantly to the asset swell. According to Hedge Fund Research, this historic growth indicates strong investor confidence in the sector's ability to navigate market trends and geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. Current rates on top CDs, particularly from online banks, are significantly higher than national averages, with short-term CDs often providing the best yields due to an inverted yield curve. Savers can lock in these high rates for the duration of the CD term, which provides stability and protection against future rate drops.

          <p>In a significant political upset, the Plaid Cymru party has won the Senedd by-election in Caerphilly, a constituency held by the Labour Party for over a century. The result is a major blow to Labour, which finished in a distant third place, and a setback for Reform UK, which came in second despite a strong campaign. Plaid Cymru's victory is seen as a sign of shifting political tides in Wales ahead of the full Senedd election. The party successfully positioned itself as the primary alternative for change, capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with both the UK and Welsh Labour governments.</p>
