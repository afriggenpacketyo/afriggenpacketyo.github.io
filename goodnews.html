          <p>At 95, Clint Eastwood maintains his vitality through a disciplined lifestyle he has followed for decades, according to celebrity biographer Shawn Levy. The actor and director is described as a "lifelong gym rat" who has adhered to an organic, low-fat diet since the 1950s, long before such habits were mainstream. Another key practice for Eastwood has been daily Transcendental Meditation, which he has reportedly done twice a day since the 1970s, even while on film sets. These routines present a contrast to the rugged, tough-guy characters he often portrays on screen.</p>

The plan includes policies to support the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, modernize the electrical grid, and establish AI export packages for allies. A key focus is on setting new federal procurement guidelines to contract only with AI developers whose systems are deemed free of "ideological bias." The administration also intends to compel federal agencies to repeal regulations that hinder AI development and withhold funding from states with what it calls burdensome AI rules.

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a rain-soaked sprint finish in Valence. The peloton caught the last breakaway rider with 4 kilometers remaining, setting up for a bunch sprint that was complicated by a late crash involving some of Milan's key rivals. The win for the Lidl-Trek rider further solidified his lead in the points classification, extending his advantage for the green jersey. Overall race leader Tadej Pogačar finished safely within the peloton, maintaining his significant lead in the general classification.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division. Revenue from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming unit, which includes popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew by 16%. This growth helped compensate for a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which has been negatively affected by U.S. tariffs and changes in retailer ordering. Despite an overall net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year financial guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can be held legally responsible for their contributions to climate change and can be sued for failing to take sufficient action. The non-binding decision clears a path for climate-vulnerable nations to seek compensation from historically high-emitting countries for climate-related damages. The case was initiated by a group of Pacific island law students frustrated by the lack of global progress. The ruling also states that countries have a legal obligation to develop the most ambitious climate plans possible under international law.</p>

          <p>A feature in the Los Angeles Times explores the modern culture of dog ownership in L.A., where many treat their pets as children, leading to extravagant behaviors. The article highlights several examples, including a dog with more frequent flier miles than a business traveler and another who is a member of a posh, members-only dog park with a bar for humans. Other owners detailed preparing special human-grade meals for their "foodie" dogs or moving to a new single-story home to accommodate an aging pet. The piece reflects a growing trend where the well-being and comfort of canine companions are a top priority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a method using gene editing that could render mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria. By making a precise change to a single amino acid in a mosquito's genome, scientists were able to largely prevent the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the insect's salivary glands. The study, published in Nature, demonstrated that this genetic tweak could be rapidly spread through a laboratory mosquito population using a gene drive. While the technology is still years from field testing and faces controversy, it represents a potential new tool in the global fight against the deadly disease.</p>
