          <h2>New Research Challenges Long-Held Theory of Shackleton's Endurance Sinking</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 20:51:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher from Aalto University, Jukka Tuhkuri, has proposed a new theory for the sinking of Sir Ernest Shackleton's legendary ship, Endurance, in 1915, challenging the long-held belief that immense ice pressure was the sole culprit. Tuhkuri's study suggests the ship's inherent structural weaknesses were a primary factor in its demise. The vessel, built for less severe Arctic conditions, reportedly lacked sufficient cross-beams and diagonal bracing in its engine room, making it vulnerable to crushing forces. This new analysis, which consulted expedition diaries and structural data, offers a fresh perspective on one of history's most famous shipwrecks, whose remarkably preserved remains were found in 2022, two years prior to this article's publication.</p>

          <p>The head of Citic, Li, stated in an exclusive interview that Hong Kong should strategically broaden its financial connector role to encompass the entire Asia-Pacific region, not solely mainland China. He envisions the city as Asia's premier financing hub, attracting listings and raising capital for top-tier companies across India, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Singapore. Li highlighted Hong Kong's deep fundraising pool, high degree of capital freedom, and unique "one country, two systems" framework as crucial advantages for connecting Asian companies with global markets. This perspective emerges as mainland capital continues to flow into the city amidst ongoing US-China decoupling, reinforcing its pivotal position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a record high for the second consecutive day, lifted by a robust tech rally on Wall Street following a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD. Chip stocks, including Advantest, Tokyo Electron, Lasertec, and Renesas Electronics, were prominent gainers on the index, rising over 1% to 4%. The broader Topix index also saw an increase of 0.31%, while Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declined. U.S. equity futures showed slight dips in early Asian trading after major benchmarks set new records, with AMD's nearly 24% surge boosting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to their 32nd and 31st all-time highs of 2025, respectively.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a significant financial aid package exceeding $10 billion for U.S. farmers, particularly soybean farmers, who have been severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. Discussions involving the Treasury and Agriculture Departments are in early stages, with top economic adviser Kevin Hassett promising "big measures" soon to address the overflowing silos of unsold produce. President Trump previously suggested using tariff revenue to support farmers, stating that the administration would ensure farmers are in "great shape" despite current trade challenges. This initiative aims to mitigate the economic strain on a key agricultural sector and alleviate their financial hardships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, collectively generated more electricity than coal globally during the first half of this year, according to data from the global energy think tank Ember. Strong growth in solar and wind power met all new electricity demand, even contributing to a slight reduction in fossil fuel use worldwide. Developing countries, particularly China, led this clean energy expansion, adding more capacity than the rest of the world combined, while some developed nations increased reliance on fossil fuels. This marks a crucial turning point in global energy transitions, driven significantly by plummeting solar costs and rapid adoption.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed bullish sentiment on Take-Two Interactive, arguing its "scarcity value" could drive its stock higher following the privatization of major competitors like Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts. Take-Two, known for the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is now the sole major publicly traded American pure-play video game company. Cramer highlighted the anticipated May 2026 release of "Grand Theft Auto VI," a game gamers have awaited for over a decade, and the company's strong recent financial performance, including significant growth in GTA Online and NBA 2K. He suggested investors view any potential stock dips from game delays as opportune buying moments for long-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is set to increase parking meter rates by 50 cents per hour across its 35,000 paid spaces and extend paid parking hours, including Sundays and until midnight in nightlife areas. These changes, approved by the City Council, are expected to take effect by the end of October, with prices currently ranging from $1 to $8.50 per hour. City transportation officials state the measures aim to encourage vehicle turnover, benefiting businesses, and are projected to generate $14.4 million for the city. This comes as Los Angeles faces a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, with other nearby cities also recently raising parking rates to address financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Harry Kane has indicated he is open to discussing a new contract with Bayern Munich, signaling a decreased interest in returning to the Premier League. The 32-year-old England captain, who joined Bayern from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has scored 103 goals in 106 appearances, securing his first career honor with the Bundesliga title. While he once considered a Premier League return a certainty, his perspective has shifted after a couple of successful years in Bavaria. Kane expressed full commitment to Bayern, stating that winning a title has only intensified his motivation to achieve more and strive for bigger trophies, pushing him to be even better.</p>

          <p>China's decision to forgo its "developing country" privileges at the WTO is viewed as a strategic retreat, aligning with Mao Zedong's theory of protracted war, emphasizing a shift from weakness to eventual strength. While these privileges offer extended implementation periods and exemptions, China has already conceded some benefits and used the label to align itself with the Global South. By relinquishing this status, Beijing removes a key talking point for the U.S. and European Union, who criticized a hi-tech export powerhouse claiming benefits meant for far poorer states. This maneuver is seen as a tactical move to reframe the global trade battlefield in terms that favor China's long-term position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner commented on OpenAI's deals with AMD and Nvidia, emphasizing that these are purely announcements, not immediate deployments, and ultimately "the best chips will win." He views these partnerships as further evidence of persistent compute scarcity due to massive demand for AI services across the entire ecosystem, not just from OpenAI. The article also highlights the intensifying global AI arms race, noting OpenAI's Chinese rival DeepSeek's innovation in open-sourced models using domestically made chips, and its potential national security concerns flagged by the U.S. government. OpenAI's efforts aim to increase production and build more complex AI models to meet this growing demand. (not investment advice)</p>
