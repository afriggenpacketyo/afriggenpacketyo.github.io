          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith responded to former First Lady Michelle Obama's recent comments comparing sports talk shows to reality television. Smith took the opportunity to voice his lingering offense at remarks Obama made during the 2024 campaign, where she suggested a vote for Donald Trump was a vote against women. He clarified that while he did not vote for Trump, he felt her statement was a form of emotional blackmail that disregarded the diverse reasons people have for their political choices. Smith respectfully disagreed with both her political and media-related assertions, stating he remains "salty" about the campaign comments.</p>

Incumbent Matt Hayball is facing challenges from rookie James Burnip and newly signed American Kai Kroeger, with only one set to make the final 53-man roster. This continues a trend for the Saints, who have favored Australian punters, valued for their versatile kicking skills from their Australian rules football background. Despite the cutthroat nature of the competition, the players maintain a friendly camaraderie, focusing on personal performance in the intense environment.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Despite his promising performance, the Dodgers lost 4-0, with Snell giving up three runs on two home runs by Yandy Díaz. Both home runs took advantage of the unusually short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary stadium. While the result was a loss, Snell's sharp outing and command of his pitches were positive signs for the Dodgers, who are counting on his ace potential for their late-season and postseason ambitions.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear front-runner among the remaining candidates. With Harris out, contenders like former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are vying for prominence, but political observers note that none currently possess statewide name recognition. The wide-open field now places a greater emphasis on fundraising, endorsements, and the ability to build a public profile. The latest financial disclosures show a varied landscape, with some candidates holding millions while others will need to ramp up fundraising significantly.</p>

The production, starring Cynthia Erivo and Adam Lambert, has been highly anticipated, and Gad had previously expressed immense excitement about performing at the iconic venue for the first time.

          <p>Romanian leaders, including new President Nicusor Dan, participated in a ceremony in Bucharest to mark the European Day of Remembrance for the Genocide of Sinti and Roma. The event signals a significant shift in a country that has long been silent about its role in the Holocaust, during which over 25,000 Roma were deported to Transnistria under the Nazi-allied regime of Ion Antonescu. Speakers at the commemoration emphasized the need to confront this history, combat ongoing discrimination, and properly enforce laws against hate speech. The presence of high-level officials reflects a growing commitment to acknowledging the past and fostering a more inclusive public discourse.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are building on Ethereum, utilizing it for tokenized funds and stablecoin transactions, which now exceed the volume of Visa and Mastercard combined. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the platform's unexpected success but warns against the risk of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. Experts believe Ethereum's stability, security, and programmability have positioned it to become the essential plumbing for the future of finance, fundamentally rewiring how money moves.</p>

          <p>England's Charley Hull has moved into contention at the Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl, sitting just three shots off the lead heading into the final day. Hull shot an impressive six-under-par 66 in the third round, placing her in a tie for fourth. The leader, Miyu Yamashita of Japan, saw her advantage shrink to just one stroke after carding a two-over 74. With several players, including South Korea's A Lim Kim and American Andrea Lee, close behind, and with wind and rain forecast for Sunday, the stage is set for a dramatic conclusion to the major championship.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on content creators and algorithm-driven feeds rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research poll, 39% of Americans under 30 regularly get news from the app, consuming information through rapid-fire summaries, skits, and memes. Creators like Aaron Parnas have gained millions of followers by quickly summarizing breaking events, offering a format that appeals to a generation with a shorter attention span. While users find the platform convenient and less biased, concerns about misinformation and the influence of TikTok's Chinese ownership persist among lawmakers and media experts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that such factors alone do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining an individual, and that sweeps based on these broad profiles likely violate the 4th Amendment. The decision keeps in place an injunction requiring ICE and CBP agents to have specific evidence of illegal status before making an arrest. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, scoring 15 tries in a one-sided affair at Welford Road. However, the win was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer in the second half for a clumsy clearout, which could see her miss part of the upcoming Rugby World Cup. Before her dismissal, England's power and skill were on full display, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick. The match served as a warm-up for England, who are considered tournament favorites, while highlighting the significant gap in class between the two sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, a development driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to favorable economics, where solar has become cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that streamlines the approval process for projects under 75 megawatts. Despite the state government's removal of climate change from official policy, the economic benefits are fueling the boom. However, future growth faces headwinds from the phasing out of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>
