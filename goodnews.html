          <p>Elon Musk announced the end of his 130-day appointment as a "special government employee," thanking President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stated that the DOGE mission would continue to strengthen throughout the government. A White House official confirmed Musk's departure, stating that his off-boarding would commence Wednesday night. Musk also expressed concern that the new spending bill undermines the work of his DOGE team. The role was limited to 130 days as a special government employee, and the end date was set for this week.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings, driven by continued sales growth in its data center division, which is fueled by demand for GPUs for artificial intelligence software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's sales in China, a potential $50 billion market, with the company missing out on $2.5 billion in sales during the April quarter. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is focusing on AI inference, where its GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers, and its latest Blackwell chips are designed to improve AI answers through reasoning.

          <p>Current national average CD interest rates range from 1.70% to 2.01%, but top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41% depending on the term.

Online banks often offer more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks. Strategies for maximizing returns include considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

Analyst Charles Barkley argues that the title of "face of the NBA" cannot be assigned but must be earned, as Edwards continues to develop his game.
