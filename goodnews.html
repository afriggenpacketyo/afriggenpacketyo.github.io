          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks saw their stocks increase after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both entities, creating a combined entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated that the merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company. This deal unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership intended to prevent hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 7-3 loss to the New York Yankees, missing the opportunity to sweep the series after two previous wins. Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor start, failing to consistently find the strike zone, and the Dodgers made costly errors on defense and basepaths. The Yankees capitalized on Yamamoto's struggles, scoring early runs and preventing the Dodgers from building momentum. Despite home runs from Tommy Edman, Max Muncy and Andy Pages, the Dodgers couldn't overcome their inconsistent performance.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the distribution of bonuses from the Club World Cup by wearing shirts reading ‚ÄúClub World Ca$h Grab‚Äù during warm-ups. The MLS Players Association (MLSPA) expressed solidarity with the players, stating that the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of the prize money to the players. FIFA will pay MLS teams large amounts to participate, but the current collective bargaining agreement limits players to earning 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team. The MLSPA says the players have sought changes to the arrangement but the league has not offered a reasonable proposal.</p>
