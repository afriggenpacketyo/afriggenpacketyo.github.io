          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant increase after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a $1 billion purchase of the company's shares, his first open-market acquisition since 2020. The move, involving 2.57 million shares, was interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's future. This purchase comes as Tesla faces challenges from slumping sales and increased competition, but also as Musk pushes for a strategic pivot towards autonomous driving, AI, and robotics. The company is also asking shareholders to approve a new, potentially massive, pay package for Musk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued that this shift would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, contrasting it with what he described as China's long-term management view. This idea echoes previous suggestions from business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the pressure created by quarterly guidance. Supporters of the current system maintain that it provides essential transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching near-record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, financial experts suggest it may still be a worthwhile investment. They argue that gold has further growth potential, particularly with an expected interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which could make the precious metal more attractive compared to other assets. Gold is also valued as a hedge against a depreciating U.S. dollar and as a low-risk diversifier for investment portfolios during times of economic uncertainty. Various accessible investment methods, such as fractional gold and ETFs, allow individuals to enter the market without substantial capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed to a framework for a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok. The final details are expected to be completed in a call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week. This development follows a period of uncertainty after a law was passed requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban. President Trump has unilaterally delayed the enforcement of this law multiple times while negotiations for a potential spin-off of TikTok's U.S. operations into a new, American-majority-owned company continued.</p>

          <p>Russia is planning a major expansion of its nuclear energy capacity, with a goal to build 38 new reactor units of various sizes. The announcement was made by Alexei Likhachev, the head of state nuclear energy company Rosatom, at an International Atomic Energy Agency conference. This initiative aims to increase nuclear power's share of Russia's total energy production from just under 20% to 25% over the next two decades. The plan would roughly double the number of reactors currently operating in the country, reinforcing Russia's position as one of the world's largest users of nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth U.S. company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock value surged following a recent antitrust ruling where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared. Despite facing increased competition from AI challengers and significant regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen over 30% this year. This financial milestone marks a significant point in the company's history, approximately 20 years after its initial public offering and a decade after its restructuring under the Alphabet name.

          <p>A psychology expert advises against using generic conversation starters like "How are you?" to build genuine connections and trust.

This approach avoids boring social scripts and encourages others to share stories about things that bring them joy. The expert also emphasizes the importance of body language, like maintaining an open stance and mirroring gestures, to signal safety and build rapport more effectively in both personal and professional interactions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut, mortgage experts advise prospective homebuyers to act promptly but with discipline. Key recommendations include getting a fresh mortgage pre-approval to reflect increased buying power and comparing offers from various lenders to secure the best terms before locking in a rate. Experts caution against assuming one's current lender will offer the best deal or trying to time the market by waiting for further rate drops, as this can backfire. It is also crucial for buyers not to overextend their budget, even if they qualify for a larger loan, to avoid future financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs represent an affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. As of mid-September, average interest rates for 5-to-15-year home equity loans hover around 8.3%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 8.10%. These rates are considerably lower than most alternatives and are expected to decrease if the Federal Reserve implements further rate cuts. Experts advise homeowners to shop around for the best terms, as offers can vary significantly based on lender, location, and credit profile. (not investment advice)</p>
