The event, announced shortly before it occurred, is intended to stand up for the arts and LGBTQ progress, reminding attendees that the fight for equality continues. Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller organized the event after canceling a 2026 Hamilton production at the Kennedy Center due to the Trump administration's actions.

          <p>Super Micro Computer shares fell approximately 10% after announcing plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, and will repurchase $200 million of its stock from the note issuers. Despite the drop, Super Micro shares are up nearly 40% this year, driven by high demand for Nvidia's AI processors. The company also secured a major contract with a data center in Saudi Arabia, and has been viewed by Wall Street as an AI pure play.</p>
