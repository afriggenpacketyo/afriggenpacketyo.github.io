          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, met with White House officials to discuss potential tariff relief, as tariffs have historically burdened the fashion industry, causing companies to raise prices on goods. The meeting included Steven Kolb, the Council of Fashion Designers of America CEO, and Stephen Lamar, American Apparel & Footwear Association CEO, and Susie Wiles, White House chief of staff. The fashion industry supports ten million American jobs and has for many years paid high tariffs compared to the rest of the economy. There is long-lasting tension between Wintour and Melania Trump as the first lady was never been featured on the cover of Vogue, unlike several of her predecessors. The goal was to talk about balanced trade and how best to maintain those jobs in the US, and preserve American prosperity.</p>

          <p>This article tells the story of Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist who unmasked Russian spies and assassination plots, including the poisoning of Aleksei Navalny, which put him in President Vladimir Putin's cross hairs. The Kremlin tasked a fugitive financier, who had been recruited by Russian intelligence, to have Grozev killed, but the team enlisted for the surveillance is now behind bars. The financier lives in Moscow, visiting the Russian secret police headquarters, presumably trying to explain his failure. In London, six Bulgarian nationals were sentenced to prison for their involvement in the plot to kill Grozev, marking a rare successful prosecution of Russian agents operating on British soil.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has been promoting the project as a national priority, pushing Japan and South Korea to invest, and threatening higher tariffs if they don't offer favorable trade deals. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured, as countries seek to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. The project would initially serve domestic demand in Alaska, and the Department of Defense is prepared to support it with offtake agreements to supply gas to strategic bases across the state.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. The two main candidates are Lee Jae-myung from the liberal Democratic Party and Kim Moon-soo from the conservative People Power Party (PPP). Lee Jae-myung is leading in opinion polls despite facing ongoing legal cases and investigations for corruption, while Kim Moon-soo, who served as labor minister under Yoon, is trailing behind. The Democratic Party already holds a parliamentary majority, and the election is a significant step towards stabilizing the country after months of political instability.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are impacting Chinese restaurants, with Geng Xiaoyun, a restaurant owner in Beijing, forced to remove American chicken feet from the menu due to a 30% price increase. American chicken feet, known as "phoenix talons" in China, were favored for their spongy texture and superior taste compared to local alternatives. Geng is now sourcing chicken feet from Brazil or Russia but hopes to serve the American variety again once prices decrease. The owner hopes that the price of American chicken feet will come back down, as long as there are no big changes in the world's political situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal dispute over water costs. The agreement establishes a fixed price for delivering supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, adjusted annually for inflation, instead of paying MWD's rates. The settlement enables greater collaboration between the agencies, improving finances and facilitating water movement where needed, and also allows the Water Authority to sell supplies to MWD or other member agencies in Southern California. This settlement brings greater fiscal certainty and new opportunities to move water to communities that need it most, stabilizing water rates for San Diego County residents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture after pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that the closures would hinder the USDA's ability to support farmers in California, the nation's largest agricultural state. The original plan, part of broader government agency layoffs, aimed to save costs but was met with concerns about reduced access to essential resources for farmers. The administration will keep eight offices open, but is still considering the closure of one office in Mt. Shasta.</p>
