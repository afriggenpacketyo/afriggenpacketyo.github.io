          <p>In a significant act of cooperation, Mexico has extradited 26 prominent cartel members to the U.S. to face charges for drug trafficking, murder, and other violent crimes. This group includes leaders from the notorious CJNG and Sinaloa cartels, such as Abigael González Valencia of "Los Cuinis." The transfer occurs amidst ongoing pressure from the Trump administration for Mexico to intensify its crackdown on criminal organizations responsible for smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics. Both nations have hailed the move as a crucial step toward dismantling these dangerous networks and ensuring public safety.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, preparing properly before joining a debt relief program is crucial for success. This article outlines four key steps, starting with a comprehensive review of all debts, income, and expenses to understand the full financial picture. It is also essential to research and understand how different relief options, like settlement or consolidation, will impact personal finances, including credit scores and potential tax liabilities. Finally, creating a realistic monthly budget and pausing all new credit activity are vital for staying on track and achieving long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a benign inflation reading, many economists believe the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates at its next meeting. The central bank has held rates steady for months, balancing concerns about tariff-induced inflation against signs of a cooling economy. However, with the labor market showing a significant slowdown, a rate cut is now seen as a likely measure to prevent a potential economic downturn. Futures markets reflect this sentiment, with investors pricing in a nearly 96% chance of a quarter-point rate reduction in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club is reportedly close to completing a deal to sign highly-rated teenage defender Giovanni Leoni from Italian club Parma for a fee around £26 million. The 18-year-old Italy U-19 international has become a primary target for the Premier League side as it looks to strengthen its defense. In addition to Leoni, Liverpool is also in ongoing negotiations with Crystal Palace for their captain and England international, Marc Guehi. These potential acquisitions would significantly increase Liverpool's summer spending as they reinforce their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <h2>Small-Cap Stocks Experience Rally Amidst Investor Rotation Away from Big Tech</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks saw a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, as investors shifted away from megacap technology companies. This market rotation is fueled by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on loans to finance their operations and growth. In contrast, the Magnificent 7 index, which tracks major tech giants, experienced a slight decline, signaling a potential shift in market leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. Previously, the discount on most food items was only available during the holiday season. The move, which the company said was one of its most requested benefits, comes as rising tariffs are expected to lead to higher consumer prices. The expanded perk for its 1.6 million U.S. employees could help them offset the impact of inflation while also encouraging them to spend more at Walmart's own stores.</p>

          <p>U.S. homeowners are currently sitting on a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, with the average mortgage holder having access to about $213,000. This article explains how homeowners can calculate their available equity to potentially borrow against it using financial tools like home equity loans or HELOCs. The calculation involves subtracting the outstanding mortgage balance from the home's current market value, with lenders typically allowing borrowing up to 80% of the resulting equity. While this presents a significant financial opportunity, homeowners are cautioned to borrow responsibly as the home serves as collateral for the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

This article calculates the potential earnings for both, showing that with current top rates, a money market account at 4.40% APY would earn slightly more over a year ($2,200) than a high-yield savings account at 4.35% APY ($2,175).

          <p>According to AWS CEO Matt Garman, succeeding in the age of artificial intelligence will depend less on technical knowledge and more on strong "soft skills."

Garman emphasizes that creativity, flexibility, and the ability to adapt to new technologies will be paramount for future career success. He noted that even with AI handling administrative tasks, communication and other "people skills" will remain essential for effective collaboration and customer interaction.</p>
