          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek has claimed her first Wimbledon title in a stunningly one-sided final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This marks the first "double bagel" victory in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911 and Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title overall. The 24-year-old demonstrated mastery on grass, previously considered her weakest surface, while Anisimova struggled with nerves in her first major final appearance, committing numerous unforced errors.</p>
