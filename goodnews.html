          <p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara discusses ongoing efforts to reform the police department five years after George Floyd's murder, acknowledging the "open wound" Floyd's death left on the city. O'Hara emphasizes a focus on reducing crime while building community trust, adjusting arrest tactics, improving officer training, and restoring pride within the police force. Despite a shortage of officers and violent crime rates that have not improved as much as in other major cities, O'Hara remains committed to making a difference. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of six police agencies, but O'Hara assures that reform efforts will continue in Minneapolis. The optimism score is 65.</p>
