          <p>Charles Rangel, who represented New York in Congress for over four decades and was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, notably chairing the House Ways and Means Committee. His career included accolades for his military service in the Korean War, as well as a censure by the House for ethics violations, though he remained a respected figure and continued to serve in Congress. Tributes have poured in from fellow politicians, acknowledging his significant contributions to Harlem, New York City, and the nation.</p>

The museum's collection will include items amassed by Lucas over the years such as Hollywood memorabilia, book and magazine illustrations, comic books, and Norman Rockwell paintings.

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been identified in the United States, prompting concerns about its transmissibility and potential impact. Symptoms are reported to be similar to previous strains, though data suggests it may spread more easily. Meanwhile, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to seniors and those with underlying conditions, requiring new clinical trials for wider use, which could delay access for lower-risk groups. Experts caution that these restrictions may create confusion and reduce vaccination rates, despite the availability of other preventative measures like masking and hygiene practices.</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," has created a new HBO movie called "Mountainhead," a satire of nihilistic tech oligarchs. The movie centers on three billionaires who gather at a modernist mansion in Utah, where they fantasize about taking over failing nations and running them like start-ups. One of the billionaires releases content tools that make it easier to create deepfakes, leading to global instability. The article suggests that art and entertainment can make such figures feel real in a more visceral, emotional way, and that it is important for pop culture to engage with America‚Äôs disorienting descent into clownish authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are optimistic about resolving the trade war with the US after President Donald Trump delayed imposing 50% tariffs until July 9. The delay followed a call between Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to expedite trade negotiations. The EU has reiterated its "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Trump's history of flip-flopping on border taxes has left businesses uncertain, and his 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place. The EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on US goods, but they will be reinstated without a deal.</p>

          <p>Taylor Fritz and Emma Navarro, two of the top American seeds at the French Open, were eliminated in the first round. Fritz, the runner-up at last year's US Open, lost to Daniel Altmaier of Germany, while Navarro was defeated by Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain. This marked a significant setback for both players, as Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since 2007, and Navarro had previously reached the fourth round in Paris.</p>

          <p>Hungary's opposition leader, Peter Magyar, walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania to gain the support of ethnic Hungarians, an important voter group. Magyar is challenging Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who accuses Magyar of working for the Ukrainian secret service. Magyar's walk aimed to address the concerns of Hungarians and signal the end of the Orban era. Recent polls suggest Magyar and his Tisza Party could defeat Orban and Fidesz in the next parliamentary election.</p>
