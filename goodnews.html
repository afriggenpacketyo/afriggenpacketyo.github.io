          <p>Thousands of EE and BT customers across the United Kingdom experienced a significant network outage, leaving them unable to make or receive voice calls. The disruption also temporarily affected some users' ability to contact emergency services, although the government confirmed that 999 call functionality was restored. BT, which owns EE, acknowledged a technical fault was responsible for the issue and later announced the problem had been resolved with services returning to normal. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is in contact with BT to determine the full scale and cause of the widespread service interruption.</p>

          <p>Job postings mentioning artificial intelligence skills have surged, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years, significantly outpacing general job growth. A recent Brookings Institution report highlights that AI-related listings more than doubled in the past year alone, reflecting increased adoption of the technology by companies. While concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, these higher-paying jobs are spreading to other regions and non-tech sectors like finance and marketing. Experts note that while AI's impact is visible, it currently constitutes a small fraction of the overall labor market.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, suffered a significant network outage, with over 60,000 users reporting issues on the tracking site Downdetector. Musk acknowledged the problem on his social media platform, X, apologizing for the disruption and stating that service would be restored shortly. The outage occurred just one day after T-Mobile launched its new satellite service powered by Starlink, which is designed to provide mobile connectivity in remote areas. It was not immediately clear if the new T-Mobile service was impacted by the widespread network failure.</p>

          <p>Ride-sharing company Lyft is rolling out a new feature that allows passengers to designate drivers they liked as a "favorite" within the app. This function will prioritize matching the rider with their preferred drivers for future scheduled trips, aiming to enhance user experience and foster better connections. The company stated the feature gives riders more control and provides drivers with priority access to certain customers, potentially increasing their earning opportunities. This move follows competitor Uber's recent launch of a feature for female passengers to select female drivers, a service Lyft already offers with its Women+ Connect program.</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Outfitters Becomes Latest Meme Stock After Announcing Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 16:18:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally driven by individual investors. The stock gained significant attention on Reddit's Wall Street Bets forum following the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. With over 13% of its available shares sold short, the company was a prime target for a short squeeze, where rising prices force investors betting against the stock to buy shares to cover their positions. The rally provides a boost for the stock, which had fallen about 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked a lower-court decision in a North Dakota redistricting case that would have severely weakened the Voting Rights Act. The ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had stated that only the Justice Department, not private individuals or civil rights groups, could file lawsuits under Section 2 of the landmark 1965 law. The Supreme Court's order prevents this interpretation from taking effect and indicates the justices will likely hear the case, which could be decided by next summer. The case originated from a lawsuit by two Native American tribes who argued the state's legislative map diluted their voting power.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has made a remarkable return to his best bowling form, culminating in his first five-wicket haul in a Test match since 2017. After undergoing knee and hamstring surgeries, there were doubts about his ability to bowl again at the highest level, but his dedicated rehabilitation has paid off. During the current series against India, Stokes has taken the most wickets of any bowler and is bowling at his fastest average speed since 2019. His resurgence as a potent all-rounder, capable of turning matches with crucial wickets, has been a significant boost for the England team.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim that the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert is false. The posts, which have been viewed millions oftimes, feature a real image from the concert alongside a fabricated, AI-generated image in the style of the cartoon. A DW Fact Check confirmed that the alleged scene does not appear in the episode cited by the rumors or any other episode of the show. While the series has been noted for coincidentally foreshadowing some real-world events over its long run, this particular instance is a clear example of digital manipulation.</p>

          <p>Actress Molly Gordon, known for supporting roles in projects like "The Bear" and "Theater Camp," is stepping into her first film lead in "Oh, Hi!," a movie she also co-wrote and produced. Frustrated by a lack of leading opportunities, Gordon helped create the role of Iris, a woman who takes her non-committal boyfriend hostage to convince him of their compatibility. The film, described as a "rom-com gone wrong," allows Gordon to showcase a wider emotional and comedic range. This move reflects a growing trend of actors creating their own material to build the careers they want in a changing Hollywood landscape.</p>
