          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as "quantitative tightening," could end in the coming months. In a speech, Powell noted that the Fed is approaching its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for the banking system and that liquidity conditions are beginning to tighten. This process involves allowing securities purchased during the pandemic to mature without reinvestment, which effectively tightens monetary policy. While providing this update, Powell remained noncommittal on the future path of interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has executed its largest-ever forfeiture, seizing approximately $15 billion in bitcoin linked to a massive "pig butchering" scam. The operation was allegedly run by Chen Zhi, founder of the Cambodia-based Prince Holding Group, who remains at large. Prosecutors claim the group operated forced-labor compounds where trafficked individuals were made to carry out cryptocurrency investment scams that defrauded victims worldwide of billions. These scams involved building trust with victims online before convincing them to transfer funds under false pretenses for laundering by the criminal organization.</p>

          <p>With silver prices surging to nearly $50 per ounce, this article outlines the most liquid forms of silver for investors looking to sell. Government-minted coins like American Silver Eagles are highlighted as the easiest to sell due to their guaranteed purity and universal recognition among dealers. Silver bars from reputable mints, popular silver rounds, and pre-1965 U.S. "junk silver" coins are also considered highly liquid options for physical assets. For non-physical holdings, silver-backed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offer the quickest path to liquidation through a simple brokerage trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent research highlights a significant gap between the values of Gen Z employees and the priorities of hiring managers, potentially contributing to hiring difficulties. A study found that Gen Z's top values are self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping others. In contrast, hiring managers are primarily looking for candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. The article's author advises young job-seekers to be honest about their financial goals, which can help determine whether to adapt to traditional workplace expectations or seek careers aligned with their personal values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details potential pathways for individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, focusing on the concept of debt forgiveness. It clarifies that while there are no government-sponsored forgiveness programs for credit cards, consumers can negotiate with creditors through debt settlement companies to pay less than the total amount owed. This process, however, can negatively impact one's credit score. The article also presents bankruptcy as a last-resort option for complete debt forgiveness, alongside less drastic alternatives like debt consolidation loans and financial hardship programs.

          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has announced his support for suspending President Macron's controversial 2023 pension reforms in a bid to save his government from a no-confidence vote. The reforms, which raised the retirement age to 64, sparked widespread protests and were seen as a key part of Macron's agenda. To survive crucial upcoming votes, Lecornu needs the support of Socialist MPs, who made the suspension of the reforms their primary condition. This major concession highlights the fragile political situation in France and the president's desire to avoid further turmoil.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to pay the damages to families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims for falsely claiming the massacre was a hoax. He had argued that the judgment was a "financial death penalty" that violated his free speech rights. Jones has not yet paid any of the damages, and the denial of his appeal clears a path for the families to continue collection efforts.</p>

This evidence was presented during the stalking trial of Wandelt and her associate, Karen Spragg, who are accused of causing serious alarm and distress to Madeleine's parents. The prosecution alleges that Wandelt persistently claimed to be Madeleine and, with Spragg's help, harassed the McCanns with messages and visits, demanding a DNA test.

However, Europe's involvement is complicated by internal political factors and the need for a clearly defined mandate for any deployed forces. Securing a position on the U.S.-led "Board of Peace" may also require the EU to adjust its diplomatic stance toward Israel.</p>

While acknowledging the agreement was primarily brokered by the U.S., Starmer argued that the UK's diplomatic move, alongside allies, allowed it to work effectively "behind the scenes." Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the move, claiming it rewarded terrorism and diminished UK influence. Starmer also committed an additional £20 million in humanitarian aid and offered UK expertise for the reconstruction of Gaza.</p>
