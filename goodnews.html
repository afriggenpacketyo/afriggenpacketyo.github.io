          <p>Week 5 of the 2025 NFL season delivered a series of unexpected outcomes and significant shifts in team standings across the league. A major upset saw the Denver Broncos hand the Philadelphia Eagles their first loss of the season, ending their undefeated streak. Other notable results included the San Francisco 49ers' thrilling overtime victory against the Los Angeles Rams, and dominant performances by the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans. The Tennessee Titans and New Orleans Saints secured their initial wins, while the New York Jets remained the sole team without a victory, highlighting a wild week of football action.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to hit a record high following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's election of Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. This market rally was driven by gains in real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical stocks, with the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar. Analysts anticipate Takaichi's administration will likely maintain an accommodative monetary policy, fostering an economic environment aimed at expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships. This strategic policy direction further boosted investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million Apple and Samsung smartphone users in the UK could be entitled to a share of a £480 million payout if the consumer group Which? succeeds in its legal case against US tech giant Qualcomm. The trial, ongoing in London, accuses Qualcomm of engaging in anti-competitive practices by forcing Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential handset components. Which? claims these practices ultimately drove up smartphone costs for consumers. If successful, the estimated payout would be around £17 per affected British phone owner who purchased devices between 2015 and 2024.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of a "swag gap," which describes a noticeable difference in fashion sense or effort in appearance between romantic partners, is gaining traction on social media platforms like TikTok. While some individuals find such aesthetic disparities incompatible, others embrace them, emphasizing that personal style is a spectrum rather than a hierarchy. Relationship experts suggest that while significant style differences could lead to conflicts if one partner feels disrespected or superior, mutual respect and shared values are ultimately more crucial for a healthy relationship than matching wardrobes.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party plans to announce a "first-job bonus" at its conference, proposing a £5,000 tax rebate for young people towards their first home upon securing full-time employment. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride is expected to detail this proposal, which aims to divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account to help first-time buyers. The party asserts that these plans will be financed by substantial public spending cuts totaling £47 billion over five years, targeting areas such as welfare, the civil service, and the foreign aid budget to ensure fiscal responsibility and "reward work."</p>

A notable surge in cross-border capital flows between the city and mainland China this year underscores Hong Kong's enduring importance in facilitating China's global economic ambitions. Hu highlights the city's unique advantage as a proving ground for financial innovation, citing recent yuan-denominated dual listings as tangible evidence of its capacity to realize China's economic ideas and connect them with the international market.

          <p>President Trump has urged negotiators to "move fast" on a Gaza peace deal as crucial talks are set to commence in Cairo, aiming to end the two-year conflict. Hopes for a resolution increased after Hamas indicated it would consider parts of a US-led peace plan, which includes releasing the remaining hostages. While Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope for a hostage release "in the coming days," he signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. US and Egyptian officials are joining the discussions, primarily focusing on a proposed hostage-for-Palestinian prisoner exchange.</p>

Director Rob Reiner explained that both Spinal Tap films rely on minimal outlines rather than traditional scripts, making the editing process a complex "jigsaw puzzle with no picture on the box" due to the spontaneous dialogue.</p>

Despite recent breakthroughs, experts note that China still lags in complex analytics and highly developed supply chains. However, Beijing's state-led investments and strategic pressure on Washington aim to achieve self-reliance in advanced chip technology within five years. (not investment advice)</p>

Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes will "fix the broken system" by legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide key property information upfront. Proposed reforms also include the introduction of binding contracts to prevent parties from withdrawing late in the process, a move intended to boost professional standards and improve overall confidence and efficiency within the housing sector.</p>

While manager Arne Slot may allow Salah the freedom to focus on attack, the article suggests other players are not adequately covering for him, leading to defensive overloads. Despite recent disappointing results, the analysis emphasizes that Salah's scoring form is likely to return, and the team's broader issues are resolvable through better midfield support and improved game control as new player relationships and fitness levels develop throughout the season.</p>

He explains that public images, unlike some historical writings, often reflect widely understood societal messages and political debates, such as the concept of jurisdictional authority in the Han dynasty. Powers argues that art actively "participates" in political discourse, revealing how intergroup relations were imagined and demonstrating core political concepts like arbitrary privilege, which he likens to Montesquieu's idea of "honour" in aristocracies.</p>
