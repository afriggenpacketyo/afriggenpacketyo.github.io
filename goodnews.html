          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Powell Cautions About Persistently Higher Long-Term Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 10:16:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to remain elevated due to economic changes and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, which could pose challenges for both the economy and central banks. He cautioned that the era of near-zero interest rates is unlikely to return soon, emphasizing the Fed's reluctance to ease policy after previous rate cuts. While not directly mentioning President Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged their potential impact on slowing growth and boosting inflation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 10:12:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding forecasts and signaling a potential turning point, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The growth was driven by increased consumer spending and business investment, although analysts caution that this strong rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While the Labour government views the figures as encouraging, critics express concern over the impact of tax rises on economic progress. The Bank of England recently lowered interest rates, hinting at further cuts, though the stronger growth may temper market expectations.</p>

          <p>ESPN's NFL Draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. defended his coverage of quarterback Cam Ward after Miami Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal claimed he didn't speak with Kiper about Ward. Kiper highlighted that he ranked Ward higher than other draft experts, despite Cristobal's claim of speaking to numerous people about the player. The Tennessee Titans selected Ward as the No. 1 overall pick, and Kiper faced criticism for focusing on Shedeur Sanders' draft slide during the event. Kiper stated he also didn't speak to Deion Sanders about Shedeur either.</p>

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is working to counter the narrative that American meat is substandard.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. Deaths declined across all major drug categories and in most states, with experts attributing the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply and increased access to treatment. Despite this progress, the Trump administration is proposing cuts to many federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, raising concerns about sustaining the momentum. In 2024, 80,391 people died from drug-related causes, still considered unacceptably high.</p>
