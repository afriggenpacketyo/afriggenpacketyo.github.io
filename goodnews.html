          <p>Adolfo "Fito" Macias, the notorious leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, has been extradited from Ecuador to the United States. This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its citizens to a foreign country. Macias faces charges in New York for cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and firearms violations, following his recapture in June after a high-profile prison escape in January. His extradition is a significant moment in Ecuador's struggle against powerful drug cartels that have turned the nation into a key hub for global cocaine trafficking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines and conventional wisdom suggesting market turmoil, several underlying strengths are supporting the stock market. The article argues that strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, are setting a positive tone for the current season. Furthermore, it points to the economic stimulus expected from President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," which includes extended tax cuts and benefits for workers and families. Other positive factors include tax relief for businesses, reshoring of manufacturing, and massive investment in data centers and the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>
