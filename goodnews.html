          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, arrived in New Jersey following his release from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation due to his pro-Palestinian activism, which they deemed detrimental to foreign policy interests. Upon arrival, Khalil asserted his commitment to advocating for Palestinian rights, while New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. Judge Michael Fabiarz stated that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

The team also plans to partner with organizations like the California Community Foundation and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor to provide further aid. The Dodgers' actions follow criticism for their initial silence on the issue, given their large Latino fan base and influence in the region. Several players and figures associated with the team have spoken out against the immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski made MLB history after pitching into the seventh inning with a perfect game bid in his second MLB start. Misiorowski, who throws in the triple digits, became the first starting pitcher in the modern era to start his career with 11 consecutive no-hit innings. He finished the game with six strikeouts, topping out at 102.1 mph, before being pulled after allowing a home run. Misiorowski is also the only big leaguer since 1900 to have more wins than hits allowed in his first two career starts.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a tense week due to the intensifying war between Israel and Iran, and updates from the Federal Reserve. Investors closely monitored safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets such as oil. The Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged, following lackluster updates on the consumer and housing market. The Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady makes sense, considering the dueling dynamics and the uncertainty around tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that global population data may be underrepresenting rural areas by a significant margin. Researchers from Aalto University in Finland analyzed data from rural dam projects and found discrepancies compared to other population datasets. The study estimates that rural populations may have been underestimated by 53 percent to 84 percent between 1975 and 2010. While such underreporting could impact resource allocation, other experts remain skeptical of the study's findings.</p>
