          <p>In response to state laws restricting unofficial flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags. Salt Lake City approved flags with Pride, transgender Pride, and Juneteenth symbols, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official. These actions are viewed as a response to state measures perceived as targeting L.G.B.T.Q. flags, with city officials emphasizing values of diversity and inclusion. The Utah House speaker criticized Salt Lake City's move as a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are re-introducing the "SAFE Home Act" to prevent federally funded agencies from discriminating against potential adoptive parents who object to gender-affirming treatments for children. The bill aims to ensure parents are not required to provide medical, surgical, or psychological treatments related to gender identity. This legislation is partly a response to a Biden-era HHS rule promoting homes that affirm a child's sexual orientation or gender identity. The act seeks to protect the rights of parents to raise children according to their beliefs.</p>
