          <p>This article from DW discusses the dangers of thrombosis, a condition where blood clots form in blood vessels, blocking blood flow, even for top athletes like basketball superstar Victor Wembanyama and tennis icon Serena Williams, who have had to deal with it. Sports physician Pascal Bauer explains that athletes are not immune to the condition and that repetitive arm movements in sports like ice hockey, handball, basketball, volleyball, baseball, and tennis can increase the risk. The article also highlights the importance of preventive sports examinations, good training hygiene, and staying hydrated to reduce the risk of thrombosis, and it also mentions the use of blood-thinning medication as a treatment.</p>

          <p>This DW article examines Europe's reliance on US payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal and the concerns raised by ECB President Christine Lagarde about the risks of such dependence. Lagarde advocates for a European alternative to maintain control over digital payments, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions. While some experts downplay the extent of US dominance, the article highlights the growing use of app-based payments led by American tech firms and explores potential solutions like Russia's model of domestic transaction processing and the development of a digital euro, but also includes the European Payment Initiative (EPI) called Wero.</p>

          <p>This CNBC article reports that China is easing its ban on K-pop acts, signaling a potential shift to revitalize domestic demand amid a trade war with the United States. The move is seen as a tariff-proof sector that can stimulate spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce. Analysts suggest that China may also be seeking to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea, through cultural diplomacy, and the reintroduction of K-pop could foster regional goodwill and the approval for K-pop group Epex's concert is a "policy test case" that could pave the way for larger acts.</p>
