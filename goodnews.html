          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to address illegal migration across the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the military's focus is on national defense, while the UK Border Force is specifically tasked with policing the nation's borders. The comments came after nearly 1,000 migrants crossed the Channel and as the UK government proceeds with its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France. Former military commanders also cautioned that using the military would be complicated and unlikely to add much to existing efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" for its excessive length and florid detail. Judge Steven Merryday criticized the filing for violating federal rules that require allegations to be simple and concise. While the suit was thrown out, the judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, shorter complaint with a 40-page limit. The New York Times has maintained that the lawsuit is an intimidation tactic meant to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>Retired boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas supercar dealership, alleging fraud and deceptive trade practices in a multimillion-dollar transaction. Mayweather claims the dealership, Vegas Auto Gallery, misrepresented the history and value of a 2018 Maybach Landaulet he purchased. According to the boxer, he was charged $1.2 million for the vehicle, but later discovered the dealer had paid only $728,000 for it. The lawsuit also alleges the car lacked the required legal documentation, including title and inspection certificates, making the sale illegal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., though a final agreement has not yet been reached. Following a phone call, Trump expressed optimism, stating a deal is "well on its way," but a White House official cautioned that more work is needed. This development comes after months of uncertainty, during which the U.S. government has threatened to ban the popular video app over national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have announced a new policy proposal to establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, make it easier for the public to report crimes, and help restore confidence in policing. To fund the initiative, the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they estimate could save over £100 million. This policy announcement comes as the party kicks off its annual conference, aiming to appeal to voters by focusing on community-based solutions.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA superstar Kevin Durant has successfully regained access to his bitcoin holdings after being locked out of his account for years. The issue gained public attention after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference, highlighting the difficulties they faced with the cryptocurrency exchange's account recovery process. Durant, an early investor in both bitcoin and Coinbase itself, purchased the digital currency in 2016 when its value was significantly lower. The incident has sparked a broader conversation online about the quality and effectiveness of Coinbase's customer support services.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors at a staggering $200 billion valuation, according to sources. This potential fundraising round highlights the massive and rapidly increasing valuations for companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. However, Musk later posted on his social media platform X that the report was "fake news" and that xAI is not currently raising capital. The funds would likely be used to acquire AI chips and build out the necessary computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>England, the tournament host and top-ranked team, is set to face rival France in a highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final in Bristol. The Red Roses are strong favorites, having won their last 16 matches against the French and maintaining a 31-match world record winning streak. Despite a dominant win in a recent warm-up, England narrowly defeated France 43-42 in a tense Six Nations decider earlier this year, suggesting a competitive match is expected. The winner of this clash will advance to the final at Twickenham to face Canada, who upset defending champions New Zealand.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, despite the Federal Reserve implementing its first interest rate cut of the year. The 10-year yield climbed to 4.127% as investors balanced the Fed's move with signs of a resilient U.S. economy, including a positive weekly jobless claims report. This counterintuitive rise in long-term yields suggests that investors are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for future economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance. Policymakers have indicated that two more rate cuts are likely before the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

During a "Monday Night Football" game, a sideline reporter suggested Kelly and Brady collaborate on film and game plans two to three times a week. Kelly explained that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource for general football strategy and insights, the seven-time Super Bowl champion is not involved in the team's weekly preparations. The NFL has stated there are no policies prohibiting an owner from sitting in the coaches' booth.</p>

          <p>On the Hawaiian island of Molokai, a community-led nonprofit called the Molokai Heritage Trust is organizing an unprecedented effort to buy back over 55,000 acres of ancestral land. The land, known as Molokai Ranch, is currently owned by a Hong Kong-based investment firm and has been for sale since 2017 with an asking price of $260 million. After decades of neglect and failed development plans by various owners, the local community is taking the initiative to restore the land to "aina momona" (an abundant land). If successful, it would be one of the largest land purchases in Hawaii's history, returning stewardship to its Indigenous people.</p>
