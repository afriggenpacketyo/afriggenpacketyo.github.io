          <p>The Trent Rockets began their season in The Hundred with a decisive six-wicket victory over the Birmingham Phoenix, largely thanks to a formidable bowling performance. New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson was instrumental, taking three wickets for just 20 runs, which restricted the Phoenix to a modest score of 122-6. Despite an early setback with the dismissal of star batsman Joe Root, the Rockets chased the target with ease. Opener Tom Banton's 43 runs anchored the successful run chase, securing the win with 22 balls remaining in the match.</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported a narrower second-quarter loss, fueled by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. The company's sales surged 84% year-over-year, and it significantly increased output of the key material used in magnets for electric vehicles and electronics. This positive performance is bolstered by a recent $400 million investment from the U.S. Defense Department, making the government its largest shareholder. The company is now focused on scaling its magnet production facility in Texas. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. mining industry is receiving significant bipartisan federal support to reduce reliance on foreign-sourced critical minerals, particularly from China. A key project is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, which received a $114 million grant from the Department of Energy and will process ore for electric vehicle batteries. This initiative, supported by both the Biden and Trump administrations, reflects a national security priority to secure domestic supply chains for materials like nickel. The Pentagon is also directly investing in companies like Talon Metals to explore for more domestic mineral resources.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the harrowing Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that helped guide the crippled spacecraft and its crew safely back to Earth in 1970, an event famously dubbed a "successful failure." He was also a crew member on the pioneering Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the moon. NASA and his family paid tribute to his courage, optimism, and significant contributions to human space exploration, remembering him as a true hero.</p>

          <p>For individuals in creative or screen-focused professions, incorporating short physical breaks can be a highly effective way to overcome mental blocks and reset focus. Bestselling author Kelly Corrigan advocates for simple strategies like three-minute dance breaks to instantly change one's mood and stimulate new ideas. Other tactics include walking during phone calls and tidying one's workspace to care for the environment where creativity happens. By understanding and working with the body's natural energy rhythms, rather than forcing productivity, people can make these micro-adjustments a seamless part of their creative process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is proving to be a major revenue driver for tech giants, as both Meta and Alphabet reported strong quarterly sales that beat expectations, fueled by AI-powered advertising systems. Meta's CEO noted that AI has brought greater efficiency to its ad platform, contributing to a 22% year-over-year sales increase. In contrast, smaller competitors like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap struggling after a botched ad platform update. The trend suggests that massive AI spending is paying off for the largest players, widening the gap in the digital ad market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold futures fell from an all-time high after the White House announced it would issue an executive order to clarify "misinformation" regarding tariffs on the precious metal. The move came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association warned that a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss exports, which apparently included certain gold bars, could negatively impact the global flow of physical gold. President Trump's tariff policies had created uncertainty in the market, causing the price spike. Following the White House statement, gold prices pulled back from their record-setting levels.

Tesla has been running a limited, invitation-only pilot program in Austin using Model Y vehicles with a human valet. This regulatory approval marks a key milestone in Elon Musk's long-stated goal of launching a widespread autonomous ride-hailing network.</p>

          <p>Analysts report a significant surge in electric vehicle sales as consumers rush to purchase them before a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is eliminated on September 30. July saw the second-highest monthly EV sales on record, with their market share reaching an all-time high of 9.1% of total passenger vehicle sales. The tax credit, which was part of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act but is being ended by the Trump administration, has been crucial in bringing EVs closer to price parity. Experts predict a potential collapse in EV sales once the incentive expires. (not investment advice)</p>
