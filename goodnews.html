          <p>Government data from England indicates that pupils who experienced even partial absence during the first week of school in September 2024 were considerably more prone to becoming "persistently absent" throughout the academic year, defined as missing at least 10% of school days. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stressed the critical importance of strong attendance from the very beginning of the new term, highlighting that each missed school day negatively impacts a child's future prospects. Although overall attendance has seen improvement since the pandemic, it still lags behind pre-Covid levels, leading to renewed calls for enhanced support and strategies to address unauthorized term-time absences.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst is reportedly not seeking reelection in 2026, a decision confirmed by a senior Republican official. Ernst, a trailblazer as Iowa's first female Senator and the chamber's first female combat veteran, secured her second term in 2020. Her departure is anticipated to trigger a competitive Senate race, with Republican Representative Ashley Hinson already considering a bid for the open seat. Throughout her time in the Senate, Ernst held leadership roles and championed federal budget cuts, although she also faced criticism regarding a confirmation vote for a Defense Secretary amidst her advocacy for military sexual assault prevention.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Indonesia's President-elect Prabowo Subianto is well-positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic framework for global diplomacy, leveraging Indonesia's role as a mediator between diverse ideologies. With the United Nations often hindered by vetoes and conflicting national interests, the article advocates for a "next world order" that emphasizes cooperation rather than confrontation. Indonesia's extensive international ties and economic power, alongside the growing influence of middle powers, make Prabowo's "constructive pragmatism" a potentially effective model for rectifying the current international system's dysfunctions. The article suggests his message will focus on practical actions for global challenges.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's highly anticipated Netflix adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" has made its debut at the Venice Film Festival, realizing a long-held ambition for the celebrated director. Featuring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the iconic creature, the film adopts a three-part narrative structure to explore Frankenstein's origins and the creature's profound suffering. Del Toro highlighted his preference for practical effects over extensive CGI, emphasizing the article's central theme of defining humanity. While some early reviews commend its grand scale and artistic merit, others suggest it may lack narrative depth despite its considerable runtime.</p>

          <p>An article examines the potential for improving China-US relations by recalling their shared history of World War II cooperation, especially as the 80th anniversary of Victory Day approaches. It highlights the often-overlooked front in China and the unsung heroes, including Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen during intense Japanese bombing. This historical perspective suggests that the past Sino-American alliance against fascism could provide a foundational model for cultivating stronger bilateral ties in the contemporary era. The article posits that acknowledging this shared struggle might offer a pragmatic approach to diplomacy, fostering mutual understanding and trust between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A hotel's proposal to silence the 150-year-old town clock in Machynlleth, Powys, during nighttime hours (midnight to 7 AM) has been denied by the town council, which recently invested £55,000 in its restoration. Hotel co-owner Huw Morgan reported frequent guest complaints regarding the clock's quarter-hourly chimes disrupting sleep. Nevertheless, councillors firmly asserted that the chimes are an essential part of the town's "character," a sentiment echoed by some local residents who consider it merely "background noise." This article highlights a clash between preserving local tradition and accommodating the evolving needs of the tourism industry, prompting the hotel to consider alternative solutions, including legal action.</p>

          <p>This article examines the ongoing challenge of establishing uniform international guidelines for safe screen time for children, noting that scientific recommendations often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological and social shifts. Experts largely concur on a precautionary approach, advocating for screen-free periods for infants to foster environmental exploration and recommending limited, supervised exposure for older children. Excessive screen time is correlated with poorer language development, reduced motor skills, and diminished social interaction, as it displaces essential developmental activities. While acknowledging the potential benefits of technology, the article underscores the critical role of parental engagement, open dialogue, and clear boundaries to mitigate risks such as online grooming and addiction, promoting a balanced approach to media consumption.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has highly praised Jack Grealish's "maverick" performance after the winger contributed another two assists in Everton's 3-2 victory against Wolves, signaling a significant resurgence for the player on loan from Manchester City. Grealish, who experienced limited playing time last season, has rapidly emerged as a pivotal figure for Everton, becoming the first player to achieve consecutive multi-assist Premier League appearances for the club. Despite his impressive run of form, Grealish was notably excluded from England's most recent World Cup qualifier squad. Moyes commended Grealish's strong mentality and distinctive creative flair, expressing optimism for his continued development throughout the current season.</p>
