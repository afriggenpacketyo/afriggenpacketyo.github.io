          <p>A SmartAsset study reveals the income needed for a family of four to live comfortably in each of the 50 U.S. states, defining "comfortably" as allocating 50% of income to necessities, 30% to discretionary spending, and 20% to savings and debt payments. Massachusetts is the most expensive state, requiring over $300,000 annually, while Mississippi is the most affordable, needing at least $186,618. The study utilized MIT's living wage calculator to estimate essential costs, including housing, food, and childcare. The report indicates that costs of living grew in most states, with some experiencing double-digit growth rates. </p>

          <p>Gap is experiencing a comeback, reporting consistent same-store sales growth after years of decline, with its sales growing by 1% in fiscal year 2024. CEO Richard Dickson, known for reviving the Barbie brand, has helped revitalize Gap by hiring fashion designer Zac Posen and focusing on Old Navy, which accounts for over half of Gap's revenue.

          <p>President Donald Trump has effectively approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel after the Japanese company committed to significant investments in the American producer. Nippon Steel will acquire a 100% stake in U.S. Steel, with plans to invest $11 billion by 2028 and fulfill commitments related to governance, domestic production, and trade. The U.S. government will retain veto power over major management decisions through a "golden share." The decision reverses former President Joe Biden's block on the sale, addressing national security concerns and supporting the U.S. steel industry (not investment advice).</p>
