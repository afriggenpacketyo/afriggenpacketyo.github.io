        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill set to be introduced in Parliament in England and Wales aims to give judges the power to add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings, preventing them from avoiding the consequences of their actions. The families of victims, including those of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, have advocated for this change, emphasizing that it provides recognition and reparation for families, while also serving as a moment of reckoning for offenders. While powers exist to compel attendance, they are often not used due to the risks of restraining disruptive individuals in court, although additional options like restricting family visits and parole eligibility are being considered. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its sales growth expectations for 2025 due to lower-than-anticipated sales of its popular Wegovy weight loss drug, facing increased competition from copycat medications.

Wegovy sales reached 17.36 billion Danish kroner, slightly below expectations, and overall revenues amounted to 78.09 billion Danish kroner.

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor, argues that President Donald Trump‚Äôs plan to weaken the dollar, known as the ‚ÄúMar-a-Lago Accord,‚Äù is based on a flawed diagnosis of the U.S. economy. While the dollar‚Äôs reserve-currency status contributes to trade deficits, it is only one factor among many, and tariffs are not a cure-all. Rogoff suggests that the current account deficit is influenced by the balance between national saving and investment, with the fiscal deficit and the strength of the American economy being key factors, and reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war.</p>

This marks her first stage role in 17 years, with Simon Stone adapting and directing the play, which also stars Andrew Lincoln.

          <p>A New York Times article discusses Morocco's growing economic ties with China, particularly in the automotive sector, as it becomes a crucial conduit for Chinese companies seeking to bypass tariffs for exports to Europe. However, Morocco's status as a connector country has become precarious due to rising tensions between China and the United States, creating a difficult balancing act for the nation. While Chinese investments have boosted Morocco‚Äôs infrastructure and economy, the country is wary of alienating the United States, which it relies on for security and strategic partnerships.</p>
