The majority of travelers are expected to drive, benefiting from the lowest national average gas prices since 2021. Airports anticipate screening approximately 18 million passengers, with the TSA urging travelers to ensure they have REAL IDs or acceptable alternatives due to new requirements. Amid concerns about flight disruptions, travelers are advised to arrive early and adhere to updated regulations regarding lithium batteries in carry-on bags.</p>

          <p>A warship dating back to the Revolutionary War, discovered at the World Trade Center site in 2010, is set to be exhibited at the New York State Museum in Albany. The 50-foot-long vessel, identified as an American-built gunboat from the 1770s, was initially used during the Revolutionary War before being repurposed as landfill in the 1790s. Over the past 14 years, experts have worked to preserve and gather information about the ship with help from Texas A&M University historical preservationists.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Science Advances reveals that clownfish exposed to a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea shrank in size. Researchers measured 134 clownfish monthly over six months and found that most of the fish got shorter, possibly as an adaptation to survive hotter temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, suggesting that downsizing may help clownfish cope with heat stress. This study adds complexity to understanding how marine life adapts to climate change, particularly in the face of devastating coral reef damage.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to address costs associated with plant closures and restructuring. The automaker may also book an additional 60 billion yen in restructuring expenses this fiscal year as it continues its turnaround strategy. This move comes after Nissan announced a net loss of 670.9 billion yen for the fiscal year ending in March, with plans to shut down seven assembly plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally. The company is seeking to streamline operations and return to profitability amid declining sales and U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell on Friday as investors responded to President Trump's renewed threats of tariffs on Apple products and European Union goods. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 3 basis points to 5.039%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by 5 basis points to 4.507%. Trump's announcements, made via social media, included a recommendation for a 50% tariff on EU products and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., leading traders to seek safety in bonds. These moves follow concerns earlier in the week that Trump's budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit.</p>

Some touted the chance to bring its valuation in line with international peers with a U.S. listing, but some advisory firms warned that a new dual-class share structure was likely to reduce the voting power of minority shareholders.</p>

          <p>A new Apple TV+ documentary, Deaf President Now!, recounts the 1988 protest at Gallaudet University, a school for the Deaf, where students demanded a Deaf president. The students' actions led to the appointment of a Deaf president and galvanized the movement leading to the Americans With Disabilities Act. The film examines the nuances of Deaf culture and challenges viewers to rethink assumptions about Deafness and disability. Co-director Nyle DiMarco emphasized the importance of having Deaf people behind the camera to ensure authentic storytelling.</p>
