        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports. The deal includes arrangements such as allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with a 10 percent tariff, offering a partial exemption from new auto levies. This agreement is part of a broader effort to address global economic tensions arising from Trump's tariff policies, as Japan and the EU reaffirm their collaboration in maintaining global free trade amid these challenges. The deal could hint at future trade strategies for other countries amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Multiple newspapers are covering the new trade agreement between the US and the UK, with the Daily Mail highlighting its potential to save the British car industry. The Financial Times notes the UK secured concessions on car and steel exports but failed to reverse a flat ten percent levy on most goods. The Daily Telegraph reports the US can object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim the government dismisses. Several papers also report on the election of Cardinal Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born leader of the Roman Catholic Church, with the Guardian focusing on his past criticisms of Trump's refugee policies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:10:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after the U.S. announced tariffs on Indian exports, which are currently suspended. Experts suggest that a trade deal with the U.S. could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its access to global markets. While some concerns exist about the impact on domestic manufacturing, others believe that certain sectors, like pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly affected.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has arrested 44-year-old Samuel Patrick Groft in connection with a series of tree cuttings in downtown LA. Over a span of seven days, 13 trees were damaged, resulting in an estimated $170,000 in damages. Tips from the public and surveillance footage led to Groft's arrest, where he was found in possession of an electric chainsaw. Groft has pleaded not guilty to multiple felony vandalism charges and is currently being held on $350,000 bail; the motive for the crimes remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings due to inclement weather, but encouraging signs of a strong second quarter are giving investors optimism. Despite the earnings miss, comparable store sales increased 9.6% year over year to $1.45 billion, exceeding estimates. The company noted that top-line trends returned to normal levels in March, April, and May, with average weekly sales hitting all-time highs. However, an increase in the full-year commodity cost inflation outlook to approximately 4% is expected to put pressure on margins.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing growing pressure to allow players the choice between wearing skorts or shorts in matches. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams has criticized the enforced skort rule as sexist. A Gaelic Players Association survey found that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, as some players have threatened to refuse to wear skorts in upcoming matches.</p>
