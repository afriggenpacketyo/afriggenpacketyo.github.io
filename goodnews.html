          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock, his first open-market buy since 2020 and his largest ever by value. This significant insider acquisition was interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence, causing Tesla shares to rise over 2%. The purchase comes as the electric vehicle maker's stock has faced challenges this year due to sales slumps and the end of certain EV incentives. Analysts view the move as Musk reinforcing his commitment to Tesla's future in AI and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Early data on pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup suggests strong consumer demand, according to analysts at JPMorgan and Bank of America. Lead times, which measure the wait between ordering and delivery, are longer for the Pro models compared to last year's iPhone 16 launch, indicating robust interest. In China, a key market for Apple, the less expensive base iPhone 17 model has been particularly successful, likely due to a price cut and government subsidies. This positive initial reception has provided a boost to Apple's stock amid a challenging year for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should report their earnings every six months instead of quarterly, a change he argues would save money and encourage long-term strategic thinking. This proposal revives a long-standing debate, with many corporate executives supporting the idea to reduce the pressure of short-term market expectations. However, investor advocates and finance experts raise concerns that less frequent reporting could decrease transparency and potentially lead to more market volatility and opportunities for fraud. Any change to the current SEC mandate, which has been in place since 1970, would require a lengthy regulatory process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave rose significantly after the company revealed a major purchase agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. The deal obligates Nvidia to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032, signaling a strong, long-term partnership. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, relies heavily on the chipmaker's GPUs to serve its clients, including major tech companies like Google and Microsoft. This agreement reinforces CoreWeave's position in the competitive AI infrastructure market and boosted investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a downward trend and may drop further this week as the Federal Reserve is expected to announce an interest rate cut. Lenders often adjust their rates preemptively in anticipation of Fed decisions, meaning potential homebuyers could see lower rates even before the official announcement. The magnitude of the drop could depend on whether the Fed implements a 25 or a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction. However, borrowers should be aware that these lower rates are typically reserved for those with excellent credit, and market trends can shift quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Remains Most Cost-Effective, Despite Policy Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:09:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operational costs are significantly lower compared to fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile fuel prices. The report considers the impact of tax subsidies and President Trump's new tariffs, which are expected to increase costs for projects reliant on imported components, particularly battery storage. Despite these variables, experts conclude that a diverse energy portfolio is necessary to meet national demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are designed for long-term retirement income, but holders may need to access funds early for various reasons. The article outlines several strategic ways to withdraw money, each with different financial implications. Options include partial withdrawals, which often allow up to 10% of the value annually without surrender fees, or taking a loan against the annuity's value. For more drastic needs, one can surrender the entire contract for its cash value, though this incurs steep penalties. Other strategies include using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a better contract or utilizing special hardship riders.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly agreed to a framework deal that would transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations to a U.S.-controlled entity. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the agreement after negotiations in Madrid, stating that the commercial terms have been settled between the private parties involved. The deal aims to resolve long-standing national security concerns that the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could be compelled to share American user data with Beijing. The final details are expected to be settled in a call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
