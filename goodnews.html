          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is supported by growing institutional investment and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the coming months, despite potential short-term volatility from international trade disputes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. A temporary tariff truce with the U.S. also helped slow the decline in American-bound shipments, while imports saw their first increase of the year. This data highlights Chinese exporters' successful diversification efforts in response to U.S. trade policies, though the overall trade surplus widened significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore successfully averted a technical recession by posting a 1.4% quarter-over-quarter GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a first-quarter contraction. This growth was primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction, aided by a temporary de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, warning of significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
