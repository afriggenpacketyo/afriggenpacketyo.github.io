        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is moving the production of iPhones and other devices bound for the U.S. away from China, with India and Vietnam becoming major manufacturing hubs, according to CEO Tim Cook. This shift comes as the technology giant anticipates U.S. import taxes could increase its costs by approximately $900 million this quarter. While China will remain the primary origin for products sold outside the U.S., the transition to India and Vietnam involves significant investment and time. Apple is also planning to invest $500 billion across several U.S. states over the next four years, highlighting its commitment to the American economy.</p>
