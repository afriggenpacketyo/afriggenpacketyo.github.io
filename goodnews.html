          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amid Electric Vehicle Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 21:32:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting the ongoing boom in the electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025, with funds primarily allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China's EV market, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year, driven by strong EV sales in China bolstered by subsidies and incentives. Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, considers CATL a 'must own company' for investors in the EV space.</p>

The visit may include meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and a trip to Kyoto, a former Japanese capital, to engage in cultural diplomacy and further strengthen ties with Japan.</p>

          <p>ESPN NFL analyst Ryan Clark criticized Robert Griffin III's remarks about the Angel Reese-Caitlin Clark rivalry, suggesting Griffin was joining a "hate train" and failing to consider the experiences of Black women. Clark highlighted Griffin's marriages to White women, implying a lack of understanding of the challenges faced by Black women athletes like Angel Reese. Griffin responded on social media, calling Clark's personal attacks "cowardly, spineless, and weak." The controversy arose after Griffin claimed Reese "hates Caitlin Clark" following a flagrant foul committed by Clark during a recent game, further fueling the ongoing debate surrounding race and sports media.</p>

Goodge described the run as a "revolving nightmare" but found strength in remembering his mother's battle with cancer. He also holds the record for the fastest British man to run across the US.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% in an effort to stimulate economic growth. This move follows earlier deposit rate reductions by state-backed commercial lenders, aiming to protect their net interest margin and paving the way for lower lending rates. The rate cuts are part of a broader package of stimulus measures, including reductions to lending rates and reserve requirements for banks, amidst concerns about deflationary pressure and trade tensions. Nomura has raised its forecast for China's GDP growth, but cautions about potential risks from the housing slump and possible tariff increases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision and allowed construction to restart on the Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island after initially halting work due to concerns about rushed permits. Governor Kathy Hochul intervened, emphasizing the project's importance for New York's renewable energy goals and the potential loss of over 1,000 jobs. The $5 billion wind farm, being built by Equinor, is expected to power 500,000 homes and is now set to be completed by 2027. This reversal comes despite Trump's historical criticism of wind power and signals a potential compromise on energy policy in New York.</p>

          <p>This article provides dietary recommendations for individuals with diabetes, emphasizing the importance of incorporating high-fiber foods to help regulate blood sugar levels. Chickpeas, chia seeds, edamame, raspberries, and avocados are highlighted as excellent sources of fiber that can be easily integrated into meals. Fiber slows down the digestion and absorption of glucose, preventing sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar, making it an essential component of managing diabetes effectively.

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned three ancient artworks to the Republic of Iraq after determining they were likely looted. The artifacts, including a Sumerian vessel and two Babylonian ceramic sculptures, were linked to British antiquities dealer Robin Symes, who was suspected of trafficking stolen antiquities. The recovery and return of these items were the result of criminal investigations into looted art, underscoring the ongoing efforts to combat cultural heritage trafficking. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has seized 135 antiquities trafficked by Symes, valued at $58 million.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which aims to combat online sexual exploitation, including the proliferation of AI-created deepfakes. The law makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish intimate images without consent and requires websites to remove such material within 48 hours of a request. The bill, championed by First Lady Melania Trump, received bipartisan support but has faced criticism from free speech advocates who fear it could lead to censorship. The first lady called the law a "national victory" that will protect children from online exploitation.</p>

While the government aims to further enhance its agreement with the EU, Reeves indicated that a trade pact with Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, is the next priority. Despite previous statements about a long-term relationship with China, Reeves stated that the UK is "not looking to have trade negotiations with China."</p>
