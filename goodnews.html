          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her recent comments regarding potential Medicaid cuts.

Scholten, who has previously run for higher office, aims to make the election a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly concerning Iowa soybean farmers affected by the trade war with China.</p>
