          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London faced significant disruptions due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, causing delays and cancellations. Some services originating in Glasgow were rerouted to start in Preston, Lancashire, resulting in several hours of delay. Passengers were advised to use alternative east coast rail services or seek refunds. Network Rail Scotland indicated that repair work was underway and aimed to reopen the affected line by mid-morning.</p>

          <p>Pupils at Dame Tipping Primary School in Havering-atte-Bower, east London, have been kept indoors due to a dive-bombing buzzard nesting in the playground. The school and Havering Council are concerned about potential attacks on children, as the buzzard has reportedly swooped on residents. While intervention options are limited due to the buzzard being a protected species, the school has turned the situation into a learning experience. Pupils have named the bird Brenda and are creating art, stories, and newspaper articles about it, even receiving a visit from a bird of prey expert with a Chilean blue buzzard eagle.</p>

          <p>South Korean voters are participating in a snap election to choose a new president following the removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces trial on rebellion charges. Pre-election polls suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win due to public dissatisfaction with the conservatives after Yoon's martial law declaration. The winner will be immediately sworn in and face challenges including a slowing economy, trade tensions with the U.S., and North Korea's nuclear threats. Both candidates have presented contrasting visions for the country's future, with Lee advocating for economic revitalization and Kim warning against Lee's potential abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Borussia Dortmund is reportedly confident in securing the signing of Sunderland midfielder Jobe Bellingham, despite significant interest from other European clubs. The German club believes they are in a strong position to acquire the 19-year-old, encouraged by indications that Bellingham desires to follow in his brother Jude's footsteps by joining Dortmund. While talks with Sunderland have not yet commenced, Dortmund anticipates reaching an agreement, bolstered by their successful end to the season and Champions League qualification. This move would see Bellingham join a club with a strong track record of developing young talent.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's decision to order Max Verstappen to concede a position to George Russell after a Turn One incident in the Spanish Grand Prix is being questioned. The stewards later determined that no further action was necessary, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for hard tires under a safety car is also under scrutiny, with Horner admitting they should have left him on his soft tires. These strategic missteps cost Verstappen valuable track position, impacting his overall race result.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is increasing its military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines, prepare its army for European conflict, and become a "battle-ready, armor-clad nation." Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the defense boost, citing the need to address the threat posed by Russia and adapt to a new era of global threats. The plans include increased production of submarines and weapons, investment in cyber defense, and the development of new drone technology. The initiative aims to send a message to Moscow and reinforce Europe's commitment to its own defense.</p>
