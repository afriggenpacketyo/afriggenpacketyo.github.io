While hailed as a move to bring stability, some contentious points remain, such as a 50% tariff on steel and potential diplomatic issues for Ireland. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status as one of the sport's modern greats. Despite having the overall victory virtually secured, Pogačar characteristically launched an attack during the final stage in Paris, ultimately finishing fourth in the stage but comfortably winning the general classification. The 26-year-old finished more than four minutes ahead of his main rival, two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard. This victory marks another dominant performance in Pogačar's decorated career, which also includes a Giro d'Italia title.</p>

          <p>An investigative report details the remarkable search for a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where political prisoners were thrown alive into the Atlantic Ocean. Led by journalist Miriam Lewin, a survivor of a detention camp, and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo, the investigation tracked the plane to the U.S., where it was being used for skydiving. The discovery of its flight logs provided crucial, documented evidence of the atrocities, which was later used in court to convict the pilots, bringing a measure of justice decades later.</p>
