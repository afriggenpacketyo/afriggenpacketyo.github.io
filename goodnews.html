          <p>Hong Kong is actively seeking strategies to attract tourists, particularly those with higher spending potential, as the city's image has suffered due to protests, strict pandemic measures, and a security crackdown.

The government is exploring new initiatives and marketing campaigns to highlight Hong Kong's unique cultural experiences and attractions. The city hopes to regain its position as a premier destination in Asia by offering a wider range of experiences to international visitors. The efforts are geared toward boosting the local economy and enhancing Hong Kong's global reputation as a vibrant and attractive place to visit.</p>
