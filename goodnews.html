          <p>This article clarifies rules regarding delaying Medicare enrollment and capital gains taxes on home sales. Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties unless you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, allowing you to keep employer-provided health insurance. Delaying enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account. The article also distinguishes between the home sale exemption for primary residences and 1031 exchanges for investment properties, noting that they cannot be used simultaneously but can be used on the same property sequentially under specific conditions. This information is intended to help readers make informed financial decisions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate the queen, with the goal of saving as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the rescue operation, and most bees are expected to return to their hives by morning. The incident caused a stir in the local community.</p>

          <p>This article humorously critiques the overuse and meaninglessness of corporate buzzwords. It argues that while buzzwords are intended to create a culture of inclusion and pack pithy meaning, they often impede trust and make employees feel insecure. The article highlights how Gen Zers and lower-status employees are particularly vulnerable to using jargon. It suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money and encourages people to use plain language instead. The piece offers a humorous take on workplace communication.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to unveil a major review of the military, addressing the "new, dangerous era" marked by a malevolent Russia and increasing global instability. The review is expected to emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, modernize the armed forces, and integrate public participation in national resilience. It will likely include announcements about increased defense spending, expansion of cadet forces, and a new civilian force to protect infrastructure. While some claim the review will be transformative, others suggest its impact may be marginal, with specific details about spending and procurement not expected until later in the year. The review reflects growing concerns about national security.</p>
