        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market is being challenged by its largest customers, including Amazon, Google, Meta, and OpenAI, who are increasingly designing their own custom chips. These tech giants are developing in-house silicon to reduce costs, optimize performance for their specific software, and decrease reliance on a single supplier. While Nvidia currently holds the majority of the market, analysts predict that custom chips from these companies could account for a significant share by 2028. This trend presents a long-term competitive threat that could impact Nvidia's substantial profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. figure skater Ilia Malinin began his Olympic season with a commanding performance, winning the Grand Prix de France by a remarkable 40-point margin. The 20-year-old landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, solidifying his status as a top contender in men's figure skating. His victory extends an unbeaten streak that has lasted nearly two years, achieved even without attempting his signature quadruple axel. The event in Angers, France, is the first of six in the Grand Prix series leading up to the Final in December.</p>

          <p>J.D. Power has released its 2025 North American Airport Satisfaction Study, evaluating "mega airports" that serve 33 million or more passengers annually. The study measures overall satisfaction based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and food and retail options. For the second consecutive year, the same three airports topped the list, recognized for their efficiency in core services such as check-in and security processes. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a significant impact on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Tim Curry's forthcoming memoir, "Vagabond," reveals the actor's reflections on his career, identity, and the label of "vagabond" that he feels best defines him. Curry recounts an early experience after "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" became a cult hit, where a theater employee accused him of being an imposter. He explains that, like a vagabond, his life has been one of constant movement and reinvention, making him reluctant to be pinned down. The excerpt sets the tone for a memoir that explores his varied roles without being a typical Hollywood tell-all.</p>

          <p>The Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to play its first official matches in four years, participating in a FIFA-sponsored tournament in the United Arab Emirates. The team's participation is a significant step toward recognition and sends a powerful message of defiance against the Taliban regime, which has banned women from sports and education. Players, many of whom fled Afghanistan in 2021, view their return to the pitch as a responsibility to represent the silenced women in their homeland. The squad is composed of players now based in Australia, the UK, Portugal, and Italy.</p>

          <p>Following more than a week of intense fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes, which were the worst since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, reportedly caused dozens of civilian casualties. Under the new terms, the Taliban has agreed not to support groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, a key point of contention for Islamabad.</p>

In her article, she highlights differences in work-life balance, noting Spain's generous paid time off compared to the limited vacation days common in the U.S. She also contrasts America's car dependency with the walkability of Spanish cities, and the stress of the U.S. healthcare system with Spain's more accessible model. Other points include feeling safer in public spaces, less pressure from tipping culture, and a less polarized social environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% Value Added Tax (VAT) on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he did not confirm the move ahead of the Chancellor's November Budget, he acknowledged that the government is "looking at all of these issues." The proposal comes as the government faces pressure to reduce energy costs, which have remained high since the 2021 price spike. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household approximately £86 per year, according to estimates.</p>

          <p>The annual Medicare open enrollment period, running from October 15 to December 7, is underway, allowing beneficiaries to make changes to their health and prescription drug coverage. Experts advise beneficiaries to carefully compare their existing plans with new options, as costs and coverage for doctors and medications can change significantly year to year. This year's enrollment coincides with a federal government shutdown, which could cause delays in accessing information from official channels like the 1-800-Medicare helpline. Therefore, some experts suggest waiting until later in the enrollment period to finalize decisions for 2026 coverage.</p>
