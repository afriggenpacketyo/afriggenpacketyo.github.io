          <p>A segment from "CBS News Sunday Morning" highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, a retiree whose passion for genealogy led to a revolutionary crime-fighting technique. By applying genetic genealogy, she successfully identified and helped capture the Golden State Killer, one of California's most infamous criminals. This innovative method has since become a crucial tool for law enforcement, enabling investigators to solve numerous cold cases by tracing family histories through DNA. The article also notes her work in another case involving the sexual assault of a young boy, demonstrating the broad impact of her forensic methods.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, presenting a significant challenge to historical U.S. dominance in space. The nation is targeting a crewed lunar landing before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development and testing stages. This ambitious timeline puts China in a direct race with NASA's Artemis program, which aims for a 2027 landing but faces technical challenges, such as the need for in-orbit refueling. The article highlights the intensifying competition as both nations push the boundaries of space travel and exploration.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly Gen Z, are using AI-powered dating assistants to improve their online dating experiences. Apps like Rizz and Keepler analyze conversation screenshots and suggest replies, helping users break the ice, maintain conversations, and even navigate being "ghosted." While some users find the technology boosts their confidence and helps them stand out, the trend raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest these tools can be beneficial as a supplement for connection, but caution against using them as a substitute for genuine human interaction.</p>

          <h2>Sex Therapist Identifies Four Common Behaviors That Quietly Damage Intimacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience outlines four common but often overlooked factors that can erode intimacy in relationships. These include excessive phone use, which signals a lack of presence, and unresolved feelings about an ex, which can prevent new connections from forming. The article also points to a negativity bias, where one assumes the worst about a partner's feelings, and unmanaged stress, which can act as a major brake on desire for many people. The therapist offers practical advice for couples to address these issues, emphasizing open communication and mutual understanding.</p>

          <h2>Negotiation Expert Explains Why Securing a Raise Requires a Multi-Step Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, securing a significant pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting. The process often requires several weeks of conversations, follow-ups, and documentation. She advises initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review, as budgets are often set by then. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get an immediate agreement. Valentine stresses the importance of patience and collaborative discussion, ensuring you schedule follow-up meetings and document the conversation to maintain momentum.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, signaling its intent to engage with the company's management and board to unlock shareholder value. Despite owning market-leading platforms like Viator and TheFork, Tripadvisor's stock has traded at a discount, partly due to past governance issues. Starboard may push for various strategies, including a focus on operational efficiency, a sale of one of its business segments to highlight its value, or exploring the potential of its vast travel data for AI applications. The move comes after Tripadvisor recently received multiple acquisition offers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick as the Lions ran in a total of eight tries in a dominant display in Adelaide. The match also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a second-half substitute. However, the win was tempered by news that center Garry Ringrose will miss the upcoming Test due to a head injury, and a knee injury to Luke Cowan-Dickie.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as White House press secretary for President Barack Obama, recently described the day after Donald Trump's 2016 election victory as his most challenging on the job. Speaking at a journalism conference, Earnest recalled the emotional and somber mood among a visibly demoralized staff. He detailed the difficulty of reconciling the administration's campaign warnings about Trump with the constitutional duty of ensuring a peaceful transfer of power. Earnest shared a poignant moment when President Obama gathered the communications staff in the Oval Office to deliver an early, unifying version of his public address.</p>

          <p>After experiencing chest pains, 13-year-old Micah Clayborne was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition causing severe heart failure that put him "close to sudden cardiac death." The diagnosis was particularly devastating as his mother, Dr. Brittany Clayborne, had also suffered from the same undiscovered condition, requiring a heart transplant years earlier. After receiving his own successful heart transplant, Micah and his mother launched Transplant Teenz, a non-profit virtual community. The organization provides a much-needed support system for teenagers nationwide who are navigating the stressful experience of waiting for or recovering from organ transplants.</p>

          <p>A year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned with rock samples from the moon's far side, a scientific debate is ongoing regarding the age of the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. Chinese scientists have proposed an age of 4.25 billion years based on direct analysis of the returned samples, a figure they consider more reliable than previous estimates derived from models or meteorites. However, their findings, submitted to the journal Nature, were reportedly rejected twice by a review panel. The article highlights the tension and differing interpretations within the international planetary science community over this significant geological feature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's free, unstructured play, which is crucial for their development. While wild animals and, historically, human children engage in constant physical exploration, today's youth are often sedentary due to safety fears and structured environments. Experts suggest this lack of free play can hinder the development of a robust "movement vocabulary," which is essential for preventing injuries and building physical fluency. The author encourages parents to allow for more spontaneous, animal-like play, asserting that it fosters healthier bones, better cognitive skills, and long-term physical resilience.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Katie Gatti Tassin, author of "Rich Girl Nation," describes the high cost of beauty standards as an "insidious force" in women's financial lives. She refers to the recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," a depreciating asset that requires ever-increasing investment. Tassin argues that this financial pressure is often overlooked in mainstream personal finance, which has historically been male-dominated. She proposes a "hot girl detox" exercise, encouraging women to analyze their spending and redirect the saved money toward paying off debt, building savings, or investing.</p>
