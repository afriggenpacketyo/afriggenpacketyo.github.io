          <p>Eutelsat shares rose by 22% after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise, led by the French state. This capital increase and a debt refinancing plan will support investments in Eutelsat's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities. The French state will become the largest shareholder with 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. Eutelsat sends satellites to space via rockets from companies like SpaceX and has a 10-year deal with the French armed forces to provide priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation.

          <p>An independent commission urges the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding after destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to guide the rebuilding process. The commission also proposed a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District, funded through a property tax, to focus on wildfire prevention. The commission presented over 50 recommendations to prepare neighborhoods for intense wildfires and address global warming.</p>
