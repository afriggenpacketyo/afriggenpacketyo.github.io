          <h2>UK to End Overseas Recruitment of Care Workers Amid Immigration Reforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 09:14:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to shift towards hiring British nationals or extending visas for existing overseas workers. This initiative includes raising the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and implementing stricter training requirements for domestic workers. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the measures as insufficient and advocated for an annual migration cap, while Cooper emphasized the need for fair pay agreements to attract UK workers to the care sector. The government also plans to make changes to international student visa rules to ensure universities maintain compliance standards. Optimism score is 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns about the impact on state coffers. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also expressed skepticism, as the coalition government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. In other news, former South Korean Employment and Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo registered his presidential candidacy after a failed attempt to replace him, and three Chinese nationals were arrested in Tokyo for allegedly running an illicit poker den. The Tokyo government has also begun redeveloping an expressway into an elevated green walkway. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Argentine boxer Fernando Martinez successfully defended his WBA super flyweight title against Japanese former champion Kazuto Ioka in a 12-round rematch. Martinez won by unanimous decision, repeating his victory from their July 2024 bout. Ioka, despite flooring Martinez in the 10th round, was unable to secure the win and failed in his bid to become the oldest Japanese man to win a world title. The fight was initially scheduled for December 31 but was postponed due to Martinez contracting the flu. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research vessel was observed lowering a pipe-like object into the sea within Japan's exclusive economic zone, near the Tokyo-controlled Senkaku Islands, which are claimed by Beijing. The Japan Coast Guard contacted the vessel, urging it to cease its activities, suspecting it was conducting oceanographic research without prior consent. This incident follows a similar occurrence in October 2023, where a Chinese research vessel was detected carrying out suspicious maneuvers in the same area.

          <p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman emphasized the importance of focusing on the present value of future cash flows when assessing a business's value, even amidst disruptive events like tariffs. Nuveen's chief investment officer Saira Malik highlighted the confusion in the investing backdrop and the need for clarity regarding tariffs, noting that a 10% tariff on the rest of the world could significantly impact GDP. While some may view Ackman's statement optimistically, it also suggests investors may be too bullish given the potential short-term disruptions to profits and cash flows from tariffs.

          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem, 'Infant Longing,' delves into the complexities of love, loss, and the world's cyclical nature of beginning and ending with innocence lost. The speaker reflects on a mother's role in finding and burying the slaughtered, and feeding her child longing at both the world's end and beginning. Kisses are portrayed as seals and openings, binding and revealing. The poem questions the difference between these kisses and seeks who will remove the metaphorical stone from the tomb, ultimately finding an infinite longing moving over the face of the deep.

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with the Trump administration. This agreement would provide certainty to the ¬£40bn aerospace sector, which supports 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal would also benefit the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners. The hoped-for aerospace agreement comes after the US kicked off an investigation on 1 May into whether imported aircraft, jet engines and parts represent a threat to national security.
