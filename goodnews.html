          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting on Monday. This comes just days after Trump publicly demanded Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns over the CEO's alleged ties to China. Following the meeting, which included cabinet members, Trump stated they would work with Tan to bring forward suggestions, signaling a significant shift in tone. The change reflects the administration's active and often unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry amid geopolitical tensions with China.</p>

The project, proposed by a New York developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for when construction might begin. Urban development experts note that despite high housing demand, challenges such as high interest rates and rising costs for labor and materials are making it difficult to start new construction projects.</p>

          <p>Young fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance to help the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory against the London Spirit at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old's impressive opening spell, where he conceded only four runs from his first 10 deliveries, was crucial in restricting the Spirit's chase of 164. Despite a strong innings from Australian David Warner, Baker's disciplined and pacy bowling earned him the player of the match award. Originals' captain Phil Salt praised Baker's performance, comparing his skill to that of England great James Anderson.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face the administration's 39% tariffs, causing the precious metal to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on social media, gold futures prices dropped significantly. The initial ruling would have impacted the international flow of physical gold used to back contracts on the main futures market, COMEX. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major investment to produce a new, more affordable midsize electric pickup truck, with a target price in the $30,000 range. The company plans to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to build the vehicle, which it hopes to roll out within 18 months. This move represents a pivot for Ford toward smaller, cheaper EVs, as it has struggled to make a profit on its larger, more expensive models like the F-150 Lightning. The strategy aims to compete with both gasoline-powered trucks and the growing market of affordable Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>A new report shows that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity reached a record high of $11.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with the average homeowner holding $213,000 in accessible value. For those looking to borrow against this equity, the article outlines several options. These include home equity loans, which provide a lump-sum payment at a fixed rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which function as a revolving line of credit with a variable rate. For seniors, a reverse mortgage is also presented as an option that defers repayment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline for high tariffs on Chinese goods to resume, delaying them for another 90 days until mid-November. The move, which was expected following recent trade talks, prevents U.S. duties from snapping back to their peak levels of 145%. Currently, the U.S. maintains a 30% tariff rate on Chinese imports, while China has a 10% levy on U.S. goods. The extension is the latest example of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has created uncertainty for many businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
