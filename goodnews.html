          <p>The popular Chinese spy drama "Silent Honour" has inspired a surge of public appreciation for real-life agents, leading to an outpouring of praise and visits to the tomb of Wu Shi, an underground Communist Party member who served as a KMT lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949. Hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes have been laid at Wu's tomb, with visitors hailing him as an "unsung hero." This phenomenon highlights the show's impact on public perception, fostering a renewed sense of respect and national pride for intelligence operatives.</p>

          <p>Community leaders in California's El Dorado County are deliberating a proposed ban on single-use plastics, including polystyrene, plastic food packaging, and water bottles, to safeguard the environment. The initiative, supported by environmental groups like the League to Save Lake Tahoe, aims to combat microplastic pollution that harms wildlife and contaminates waterways. While promoting sustainable alternatives and a circular economy, the ban faces concerns from local businesses about potential increased costs and reduced profits. The California Grocers Association has urged the board to delay commitment due to limited information and potential economic impact.</p>

          <p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed a lawsuit against California to block Assembly Bill 288, a new state law empowering the Public Employment Relations Board to oversee private-sector labor disputes and union elections. Signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the law aims to address the federal NLRB's functional paralysis due to a lack of quorum, allowing the state agency to intervene when federal oversight is hampered or delayed. The NLRB argues this law usurps federal authority and creates conflicting regulatory systems. Labor unions, however, hail the bill as a significant reform designed to protect workers' rights when federal avenues are inaccessible.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is bolstering its position as a leading offshore yuan trading center through new measures, including a Renminbi Borrowing and Lending Facility (RBF) scheme. This initiative aims to make it easier and more affordable for businesses to borrow Chinese yuan, especially for cross-border investments, as Hong Kong dollar interest rates are significantly higher. The scheme, which will expand to include direct investments for mainland and foreign firms, is designed to encourage greater international use of the Chinese currency. This move by Hong Kong and mainland regulators seeks to build a robust ecosystem for yuan trading and financial services.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on imported buses. This measure aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic manufacturing. The administration will offer credits to vehicle manufacturers who import some parts for U.S. assembly, offsetting tariff liabilities. Officials state this program is designed to allow American automakers to remain cost-competitive and expand production domestically, supporting American labor and wages.</p>

          <p>Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, is being celebrated as a visionary strategist and technocrat responsible for the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces. Often compared to American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu directed the transformation of the PLA Navy to world-class standards. Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at 13 and rose through the ranks before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking a pivotal moment in his career and China's maritime ambitions. His leadership laid the foundation for China's "blue sea strategy."</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to peak around October 22nd, offering a dazzling display of bright, fast-moving meteors visible between midnight and dawn. Originating from debris left by Halley's Comet, these meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere, creating distinctive light trails. Observers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak, some potentially as bright as Venus, known as fireballs. For optimal viewing, finding a dark spot away from city lights and looking towards the constellation Orion after midnight is recommended, as no special equipment is needed.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras, India's traditional gold-buying festivals, the market is bustling despite soaring gold prices, which have topped $1,440 per 10g. While demand for jewelry is slightly dented, a significant trend shows more customers are purchasing gold and silver for investment rather than adornment, reflected in rising bullion market data and record ETF inflows. Jewellers are adapting by designing lighter, more elaborate pieces to accommodate stagnant budgets. The Reserve Bank of India is also a major gold buyer, diversifying its foreign exchange holdings. Experts predict demand will hold up in value terms, even as volumes may fall.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Sees Significant Drop in Fentanyl Overdose Deaths Amid Harm Reduction Efforts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has witnessed a remarkable turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This sharp decline is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, which has seen a 35% decrease. Innovative programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) redirect substance users from crime to recovery, offering support for addiction, housing, and employment. The widespread availability of naloxone, a miracle drug that reverses opioid overdoses, and a generational shift away from opioids among younger demographics, are also critical factors contributing to this positive trend.</p>

This action follows numerous legal claims against the city from protesters and journalists alleging excessive force during demonstrations. Council members expressed frustration over the city attorney's actions and rising legal payouts, emphasizing the need for protections for journalists and those exercising First Amendment rights.</p>
