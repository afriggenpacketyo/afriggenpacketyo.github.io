          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders participated in their first minicamp practice. Gabriel took the first snap, but Browns coach Kevin Stefanski cautioned against reading too much into it, saying the team has a comprehensive evaluation plan for all quarterbacks. Stefanski emphasized that the team is still evaluating all five quarterbacks and that the starting position is open, especially with Deshaun Watson's injury status uncertain. The article notes the Browns' crowded quarterback room, which includes Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, offering a more convenient and less painful screening method. The Teal Wand uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV testing, found to be highly accurate. The FDA approval follows a study showing that at-home screening is as effective as in-office screenings and is preferred by women, potentially increasing screening rates.

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space, splashing down in the Indian Ocean. Launched in 1972, the spacecraft became stranded in Earth's orbit after a rocket booster malfunctioned, and its return serves as a reminder of the Cold War-era space race. The article notes the Soviet Union's focus on Venus exploration through the Venera program, which achieved milestones such as the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit data from the surface.</p>
