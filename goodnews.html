          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received from her community and around the world, emphasizing her faith in the American system of justice. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was detained by plainclothes ICE officers, with the Trump administration citing an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas as the reason for her visa revocation. Democratic leaders in Massachusetts celebrated the court order, asserting that Ozturk's detention was an attempt to silence dissent.</p>
