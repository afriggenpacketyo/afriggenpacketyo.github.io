          <p>A fierce competition for a small pool of elite artificial intelligence experts is escalating, with major technology companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft offering massive salaries and signing bonuses to attract top talent. This "AI talent war" is causing challenges for startups, which are struggling to retain key engineers in the face of multi-million dollar compensation packages from industry giants. The trend reflects a shift in the tech landscape, where the most critical jobs now involve designing the AI systems that can perform programming tasks. This intense recruitment drive highlights Big Tech's fear of falling behind in the rapidly evolving AI race.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump concluded a five-day trip to Scotland by officially opening a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, which was largely centered around promoting his family's luxury properties, also included rounds of golf and a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. During their meeting, the two leaders agreed on a framework for a major trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union, though many key details still need to be resolved. The trip provided a high-profile platform for the Trump brand, blending presidential duties with personal business promotion.</p>

          <h2>Perseid Meteor Shower Peak in August May Be Obscured by Bright Moon</h2>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the most popular celestial events of the year, is expected to peak on the night of August 11 and 12. Known for producing as many as 100 meteors per hour, including bright fireballs, this year's viewing may be compromised by a bright waning gibbous moon. The moon will be about 92% full, and its glow is likely to wash out the fainter meteors, significantly reducing the number of visible streaks. Experts advise that dedicated stargazers should still seek out dark locations far from city lights for the best possible chance to witness the spectacular summer show.</p>

          <p>Amid a renewed interest in mechanical timepieces, the United States is facing a shortage of skilled watchmakers, a craft that has declined over recent decades. This workforce crisis has led luxury brand Rolex to launch a new, tuition-free watchmaking school in Dallas to train technicians specifically to service its watches. The 18-month program is in high demand, reflecting a broader need for craftspeople who can repair and maintain the intricate mechanics of high-end watches. The initiative highlights a growing recognition of the value of this traditional skill in an increasingly digital age.</p>

This technique, which involves quickly killing a fish to prevent stress hormones from affecting its meat, is said to enhance flavor, texture, and shelf life. By automating the labor-intensive process, the company aims to make this higher-quality, more humanely processed fish widely available in American grocery stores and restaurants.

          <p>Testosterone has become a focal point in modern culture, sitting at the intersection of politics, health, and masculinity. This article explores the hormone's complex history and its paradoxical role today, from its promotion by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to its use in gender-affirming care and its commodification in the supplement industry. The obsession with testosterone levels reflects broader anxieties about shifting gender roles and the perceived decline of traditional masculinity. The analysis suggests our fascination with the hormone reveals a growing awareness that our bodies and identities are more fluid and chemically influenced than previously understood.</p>
