          <p>English golfer John Parry made the first hole-in-one of this year's Open Championship during the third round at Royal Portrush. The 38-year-old used an 8-iron to ace the 192-yard 13th hole, marking what he estimated to be the 10th hole-in-one of his career, but calling this one "definitely the best." This was the 31st hole-in-one recorded at The Open since 1981. The spectacular shot contributed to Parry's strong round of four-under-par 67, leaving him at 3-under for the tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 company shares, valued at approximately $12.94 million, as part of a pre-arranged trading plan adopted in March. This sale follows an earlier transaction where he sold about $37 million worth of stock, with the plan allowing for the sale of up to 6 million shares in total. The transactions come as Nvidia's market capitalization has soared past $4 trillion, driven by high demand for its AI-powering chips. The company also expects to resume sales of its specially designed H20 chips to China soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a 27-19 victory over Australia in their first Test match, driven by what coach Andy Farrell called an "immense" performance from flanker Tom Curry. Curry, who had faced some criticism prior to the match, delivered a dominant and aggressive performance, including scoring a try and making a crucial early tackle. His efforts, alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, were instrumental in establishing the Lions' lead. The victory gives the Lions a crucial advantage in the series as they head into the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the efforts of Generation Life, a faith-based group of young activists promoting chastity before marriage to their peers at the Jersey shore. The activists connect with other Gen Z individuals by discussing shared anxieties around social media's superficiality and the search for authentic relationships. Rather than focusing on abstinence, they frame chastity as a countercultural movement about self-worth and resisting a performative, transactional dating culture. The piece reflects on whether this approach can resonate in an era of a 'sex recession' and widespread secularism, and the potential pitfalls of a worldview centered on avoiding emotional risk.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise ahead of schedule. Initially expected to miss about six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. The injury, sustained on July 2, was fortunately not a ligament tear, which would have required surgery. Muncy's quicker-than-anticipated return is welcome news for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly since their slugging infielder was sidelined, averaging less than three runs per game in his absence.</p>

The team, which finished second at the time, was elevated to first place after the U.S. team was disqualified due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The belated ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the former athletes received their medals in front of a large home crowd.

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. He suggests that true success comes from identifying what you are good at, finding where that skill can be profitable, and persevering through rejection. Galloway's own journey involved pivoting from an unsuccessful attempt at professional sports to a lucrative career in marketing and entrepreneurship. The article echoes this sentiment with advice from Mastercard's CEO, who recommends finding the intersection of one's passion, skills, and market needs.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player is said to desire. The proposed deal would be an initial loan with an option to buy, which could provide a solution for Rashford, who has been training separately from the United first team. For Manchester United, the transfer would provide significant wage bill savings, freeing up funds for new signings. Rashford has not played for United since December and reportedly does not see a future at the club under its current head coach.</p>
