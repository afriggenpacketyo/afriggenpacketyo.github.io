          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by finalizing the design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. This new type of reactor is designed to be more fuel-efficient and represents a major push by China to innovate in nuclear power technology, similar to efforts in Russia and the United States. The design is now awaiting final approval, with the facility expected to be operational sometime after 2030. The milestone was announced at an event in Fuzhou, attended by key officials from China's national atomic and energy administrations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:53:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily halting the Trump administration's mass cancellation of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grants. The judge ruled that the cancellations, which targeted members of the Authors Guild, likely violated their First Amendment rights by targeting them for their perceived viewpoints. The termination notices cited executive orders aimed at combating "Radical Indoctrination" and DEI programs, with the judge noting that the government does not have the discretion to violate the constitution or "edit history." The injunction preserves the grant funding until a full trial can determine the case's merits.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Explore Using Sensor-Equipped Sharks to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative approach to weather prediction, researchers are fitting sharks with sensors to gather crucial ocean data that could enhance hurricane forecasting. Led by the University of Delaware, the project uses sharks as natural, mobile sensors to collect information on water temperature and conductivity, especially in deep waters inaccessible to satellites. This data is vital, as record-warm sea surface temperatures, driven by climate change, have been fueling more powerful hurricanes. By turning these apex predators into data collectors, scientists hope to create a more efficient and cost-effective way to monitor ocean conditions and improve the accuracy of hurricane models.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, drawing a bases-loaded walk and later hitting a two-run homer, breaking a recent slump. Andy Pages also continued his strong performance with multiple key hits. The victory was supported by a solid start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a scoreless effort from the bullpen, providing a positive sign for the team ahead of the trade deadline.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on an opportunity to hire top scientific and engineering talent from the United States. US university funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration have made it difficult for some international Ph.D. students to complete their studies, prompting Chinese firms like Mingshi to offer them full-time positions with competitive salaries. This influx of brainpower is expected to fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which is the world's second-largest and increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for elite financial and technical expertise.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's recent hints at expanding Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified that the company is not authorized to operate autonomous passenger vehicles in the state. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that any service offered to the public, including a planned "friends and family" service in the Bay Area, must have a human driver in control at all times. Tesla holds a charter-party carrier permit, similar to a limousine service, which does not allow for driverless public transport. The clarification comes as the DMV is separately accusing Tesla of misleading consumers about its "Full Self-Driving" capabilities.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was automatically triggered after both players, who were voted into the All-Star game, chose to skip the event, with Messi citing a need for rest. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and stated that the players don't understand why missing an exhibition match leads to a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but stood by the league's long-standing policy, though he added that the rule will be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York congressman George Santos has reported to a federal prison in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to a range of offenses, including fabricating his biography to defraud voters, faking donations, and using campaign funds for personal luxury expenses. Prosecutors stated he "made a mockery of our election system" to enrich himself. After his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a future chance to prove himself, but the White House has not commented on any potential clemency request for the former Republican lawmaker.</p>

          <p>A small business owner from Leicester is preparing for a key hearing in her long-running trademark battle with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the salon 'nkd', is being opposed by L'Oréal in her attempt to re-register her business's trademark. The French firm argues that the 'nkd' name is too similar to its 'Naked' line of beauty products and could cause consumer confusion, a claim Dowdeswell disputes, citing 15 years of trading without issue. Having already spent over £30,000 on legal fees, she remains determined to fight for her brand's name.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. According to the Royal Horticultural Society, the warm conditions led to a boom in aphids, which in turn provided a plentiful food source for ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation also reported an extraordinary year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers of 2024. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to drying wetland habitats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and Cook County over their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, had argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents were unlawfully thwarting enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote that the policies do not illegally regulate ICE operations and that the decision not to participate in federal immigration enforcement is protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the ruling as a victory for the city's welcoming ordinance and public safety.</p>

For Trump, the sport serves as a competitive outlet, a high-level networking opportunity, and a stage for diplomacy, where he has forged relationships with world leaders like Japan's Shinzo Abe and Finland's Alexander Stubb. The article notes that while other presidents used golf as a diversion, Trump uses it transactionally to make connections and conduct business away from public scrutiny. It also touches on his ownership of numerous high-profile courses and conflicting accounts of his skill and sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is working to rescue the state's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by 50% in the last five years due to disease. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a major conservation effort, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up visit confirmed the success of the mission, as biologists observed the relocated sheep thriving, with newborn lambs indicating the herd is beginning to grow again.</p>

          <p>A new article explores whether people need to be strict about popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping eight hours a night. Experts suggest there is often more flexibility than commonly believed. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, thirst is an adequate guide for hydration, while a nutritionist still sees value in a target. While the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep is considered crucial with little room for compromise, experts advise that adapting exercise goals to fit one's lifestyle is better than doing nothing. The consensus is to focus on a consistent, healthy outlook rather than fixating on rigid numbers.</p>
