          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced significant spending increases for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, along with boosts for defense and housing, outlining the government's spending plans for the remainder of the decade. While additional funding is allocated for artificial intelligence and transport projects, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget cuts. Reeves emphasized that the Spending Review aims to deliver security, economic growth, and a future-proof NHS, while the Conservative shadow chancellor criticized it as a "spend now, tax later review." Despite some departments facing financial constraints, Reeves asserted that the government is not reverting to austerity measures, focusing instead on long-term investments and key public services.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers recorded detailed observations of a dying star's explosion in 1408, during the Ming dynasty, providing valuable data for modern astronomers. The astronomers described a new star glowing brightly in the southern sky, noting its size, color, and brightness in a formal report to the emperor. This rediscovered memorial confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The unprecedented details have helped researchers narrow down the star's possible position, contributing to our understanding of celestial events and historical astronomical records.</p>

According to Trump, China has agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US will walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. This announcement follows two days of intense talks in London aimed at resolving conflicts that have emerged since a truce was agreed upon in May. However, details about the new agreement are limited, and the White House is facing questions about whether its tariff strategy can quickly yield solid trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

Overall, only 30% of self-identified voters surveyed in the U.S. hold a favorable opinion of Musk, with a significant divide between Republican and Democratic voters. This shift in public opinion comes after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a social media exchange between the two figures, and despite the decline, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

While day-to-day spending is limited or even cut in some areas, the government is betting on the public's patience to see the benefits of these long-term investments. This strategy contrasts with the typical political focus on short-term wins, but the current volatile political climate and public restlessness may pose challenges to this approach. The government is taking a risk by prioritizing long-term gains over immediate relief, hoping that voters will remain patient as the changes unfold.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz cited the lack of compelling interest in keeping Khalil in custody and the potential damage to his career and reputation. The judge's decision is paused until June 13 to allow the government time to appeal, and Khalil will remain detained until then. This case is part of a wider crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war, and the judge's ruling questions the use of national security concerns to justify Khalil's detention.</p>

          <p>Oracle shares surged in extended trading after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates and signaled accelerating cloud growth. Revenue increased 11% year over year, and the company provided strong guidance for the fiscal first quarter, projecting revenue growth of 12% to 14%. Oracle also highlighted significant partnerships and cloud commitments, including with Cleveland Clinic, G42, and IBM. The company's capital expenditures are expected to increase, driven by strong demand for cloud capacity, and these positive results and outlook have boosted investor confidence in Oracle's growth prospects.
