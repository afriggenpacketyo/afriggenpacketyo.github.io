          <p>Missouri's Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, has been appointed to serve as the FBI's co-deputy director, joining current second-in-command Dan Bongino. The appointment marks a notable departure from the tradition of selecting career FBI personnel for senior leadership roles. Bailey, known as a staunch Trump loyalist, has a background as a state prosecutor and has been involved in high-profile conservative legal battles, including defending Missouri's abortion restrictions. His selection reinforces the administration's direction for the nation's top law enforcement agency, placing key political allies in positions of significant power.</p>

According to data from the AI marketplace OpenRouter, the model's usage share has surged to over 20%, second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. Alibaba attributes the model's high performance to extensive training on coding-specific data and advanced reinforcement learning techniques. This development highlights the intensifying competition among major technology firms to dominate the growing market for AI-assisted software development tools.</p>

          <p>The Apalachee Wildcats high school football team in Winder, Georgia, secured its first victory since 2021, ending a long and difficult losing streak. The win holds deep significance for a community still recovering from a school shooting eleven months prior that claimed the lives of four people, including the team's defensive coordinator. Under a new, intense head coach, the team has provided a source of unity and inspiration. The victory is seen as a powerful symbol of resilience, demonstrating that a comeback can be stronger than the setback the community endured.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that the league may abandon its traditional American and National League structure in the future. He suggested that a potential expansion from 30 teams would provide an ideal opportunity to realign the league geographically into Eastern and Western conferences, similar to the NBA. According to Manfred, this change would significantly reduce travel burdens on players and could enhance television viewership by creating more favorable time slots for West Coast games. The idea has sparked debate between traditionalists and those who see benefits in the proposed restructuring.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has enacted an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often sold as "designer Xanax." The move immediately classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance within the state, empowering law enforcement to combat its distribution. This action was taken at the request of Kentucky's attorney general, who is leading a multi-state coalition urging the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to issue a nationwide ban on the drug, which has been linked to a growing number of overdose deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill to ensure that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive the interest earned on insurance payouts for properties damaged or destroyed by natural disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds into an escrow account and retain any interest accrued during the often lengthy rebuilding period. This new legislation closes that loophole, guaranteeing homeowners at least 2% interest on their settlement funds, providing them with additional financial support as they recover and rebuild their lives after a catastrophic event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece examines the broader implications of China's plan to build a new, large-scale embassy at the historic former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues that the sheer scale of the proposed diplomatic hub is a potent symbol of China's rising global power and its long-term strategic commitment to its relationship with the United Kingdom. The project is presented as a microcosm of the complex UK-China dynamic and a test of Britain's own international standing, especially when contrasted with the UK's recent trend of selling off prime diplomatic properties.</p>
