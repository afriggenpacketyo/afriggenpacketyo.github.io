          <h2>Energy Firms to Compensate Customers for Forced Prepayment Meter Installations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 04:58:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially up to ¬£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are allocating over ¬£70m in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator. The review found that suppliers often switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent after they fell behind on bills, leading to inappropriate installations. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place, and Ofgem is continuing enforcement investigations for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo. </p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI technology at some self-checkouts, featuring overhead cameras that identify when shoppers fail to scan items properly, displaying a live-action replay. The supermarket aims to reduce shoplifting, which has hit a record high in the UK in 2024, with this technology. While some customers mocked the new tech, comparing it to VAR in football, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance. One Tesco worker welcomed the technology, citing the challenges of monitoring multiple self-checkouts simultaneously and dealing with customers attempting to steal or con the system.</p>

          <p>A report backed by the London mayor recommends decriminalising possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use, suggesting its removal from the Misuse of Drugs Act. The London Drugs Commission, led by Lord Falconer, argues that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities and fail to address medicinal use. While the Metropolitan Police acknowledge the need to adapt if laws change, they express concerns about the link between drug dealing and violence. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education.</p>
