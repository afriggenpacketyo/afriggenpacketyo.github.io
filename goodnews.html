          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, making them viable options for storing $20,000. However, savers should consider the interest-earning potential, upcoming rate changes, and access to their money before deciding. CD rates are fixed for the term, while high-yield savings account rates are variable and may fall with expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. CDs require funds to remain untouched for the term to avoid penalties, whereas high-yield savings accounts offer more liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold became the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal. Central banks' gold stockpiles are approaching levels last seen in the 1960s, and combined with rising gold prices, it now trails only the U.S. dollar in reserve holdings. Emerging and developing countries are increasingly attracted to gold due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. While central bank purchases may slow, gold's role as a hedge against global fiscal, inflationary, and geopolitical risks is expected to sustain its attractiveness. (not investment advice)</p>
