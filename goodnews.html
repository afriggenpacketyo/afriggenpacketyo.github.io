        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cautioned that a "fundamental regime change" might be occurring in financial markets as investors reconsider the riskiness of U.S. assets, particularly in light of ongoing trade tensions driven by U.S. tariff policies. The ECB's Financial Stability Review noted that markets have been sensitive to trade-related updates, with some shifts away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos suggested that elevated valuations and strong uncertainty could lead to a market correction, emphasizing the need to consider these factors. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, fueled by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of Bitcoin reached as high as $109,500, with cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking Bitcoin's price exceeding $40 billion. Regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further drive prices higher, with the number of Bitcoin held by public companies growing significantly this year. The Senate also voted to advance legislation creating the first regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, citing growth in sales to home professionals as a counterbalance to slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. While the company's quarterly sales slightly missed expectations, earnings exceeded estimates, with CEO Marvin Ellison attributing the resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service. The article indicates that Lowe's expects full-year sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year. Lowe's is also working to diversify its imports to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs.</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings concluded with a vote to keep the "tush push" play, despite a proposal by the Green Bay Packers to ban it. The Philadelphia Eagles, known for their successful execution of the play, celebrated the decision, while owner Jeffrey Lurie delivered a passionate defense of the play at the meetings. The Packers had argued that the play was unsafe and lacked skill, but the NFL has not reported any injuries related to it. Other teams have tried to run the "tush push", but none have been as successful as the Eagles.</p>

          <p>NFL teams have voted to keep the controversial "tush push" play, also known as the Brotherly Shove, after a proposal to ban it failed to garner enough support. The Green Bay Packers had submitted a proposal to prohibit offensive players from pushing or pulling a runner at any time. Despite arguments about player safety and pace of play, teams that regularly use the play, such as the Philadelphia Eagles, successfully pushed back against the ban, with Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni emphasizing that their success comes from dedicated practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a surprise bill proposing no tax on tips, with support from both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The bill, introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided the tips are reported. While this could benefit moderate to middle-income workers, policy analysts caution it may create issues such as the introduction of tips in new occupations and potential misclassification of income. The article notes that roughly 4 million U.S. workers are in tipped occupations, representing 2.5% of all employment.</p>
