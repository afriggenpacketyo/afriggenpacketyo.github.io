          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a rise on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite persistent fears about the broader economy. Key indices in Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Hong Kong all showed gains, with Australia's household spending also increasing by 0.5% month-on-month. However, global bond markets remain a focus, with long-dated borrowing costs under pressure, as exemplified by the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield nudging above 5% following a court ruling on Trump's tariffs. The mixed signals indicate a cautious optimism in specific sectors amid wider economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China has initiated an aviation training program for representatives from Southeast Asian nations this month, aiming to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919. The 14-day workshop in Beijing covers critical areas like safety management, airworthiness certification, and green development, signaling China's ambition to challenge the long-standing duopoly of Airbus and Boeing. This initiative reflects a broader trend of China-Southeast Asia economic cooperation and an effort to enhance regional aviation capabilities. The article notes that the country's nine-year-old C909 regional jets have already facilitated hundreds of thousands of passenger trips in the region.</p>

          <p>A long-lost 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by Nazis during the Second World War, has been successfully recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, was originally part of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection before it was seized by the Nazis. The painting's whereabouts remained unknown until it was spotted hanging in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata by Dutch journalists investigating a Nazi lawyer. This recovery marks a significant step in the ongoing efforts to repatriate cultural heritage stolen during the war.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's shares jumped 25% after the fashion retailer reported a second-quarter performance that "exceeded expectations," attributing much of its success to viral advertising campaigns featuring celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Despite a slight dip in sales over the May-July period, executives now forecast low single-digit sales growth for coming months. The article notes the significant customer awareness and engagement generated by these marketing efforts, including a controversial "Great Jeans" ad with Sweeney that garnered billions of impressions. The company is also navigating tariff-related costs, which have been reduced through supplier negotiations.</p>

The American player credited her changed attitude towards setbacks and a positive mindset for her impressive performance, having taken a break from the sport for mental health. Displaying fearless ball-striking and superb skill, Anisimova broke Swiatek's serve at crucial moments, earning a well-deserved place in the next round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled illegal the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, calling it "a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" on premier universities. Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard that the freeze was retaliatory, imposed after the university refused demands for reforms that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the freezing orders, which had halted critical research projects across various fields, including those related to tuberculosis and Lou Gehrig's disease. While acknowledging Harvard's issues with antisemitism, the court found little connection between the research affected and the administration's stated concerns.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in the development of artificial intelligence "agentic frameworks," which are essential tools for creating autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex tasks. Tech giants like Tencent and ByteDance are actively contributing to this advancement, open-sourcing their new agentic frameworks to compete with US players. Tencent's Youtu-Agent framework, for instance, achieved a high score on a web traversal benchmark. This move signals China's growing prowess in AI, with companies like Alibaba also releasing their own agent frameworks, intensifying the global competition in AI innovation and deployment.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, determining that the situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." This decision blocks the administration from using the obscure wartime law to remove migrants who sued in Texas, marking a significant legal setback for Trump's immigration strategy. The court found no evidence that the mass migration was an "armed, organized force." The ruling, which grants a preliminary injunction, underscores judicial pushback against the administration's broad interpretation of executive powers in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Shaoxing, a city in China, has launched a stimulus plan to boost local consumption by offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan ($700) for large banquets. This initiative targets banquet holders who host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan, aiming to encourage dining out and spending across multiple sectors. The measure reflects local officials' urgency to spur economic growth amidst broader economic challenges, while also navigating Beijing's anti-corruption campaign which emphasizes limiting extravagant practices. The city expects these new policies to generate an additional 178 million yuan in funding this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a prominent UK union group, is advocating for Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider a range of wealth taxes in the upcoming November Budget. General Secretary Paul Nowak emphasized the need for a progressive tax system, proposing taxes on online gaming, gambling companies, and windfall profits from banks to boost investment in public services. While the Treasury pointed to existing taxes on the wealthy, the TUC argues that further measures, including equalizing capital gains tax with income tax, are necessary. This debate highlights the ongoing discussion within the Labour movement about funding public services and addressing economic inequality. (not investment advice)</p>
