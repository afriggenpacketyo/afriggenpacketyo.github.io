          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening test, Teal Wand, offering an alternative to in-clinic Pap smears. The test, made by Teal Health, screens for human papillomavirus (HPV) in average-risk individuals aged 25 to 65. Studies showed that 86% of participants would stay more up-to-date with screenings if they could do it at home, with 94% preferring self-collection if accurate. The kits will be available for shipping starting in California in June, with plans for nationwide expansion and flexible payment options through major insurance providers.</p>

The Danish government summoned the top American diplomat in the country for an explanation after reports indicated U.S. officials sought information on Greenland's independence movement and resource extraction sentiment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite calls from some liberals, focusing on climate change may not be the best strategy for Democrats to win back voters who supported Trump. Polls indicate that climate change ranks low among voters' priorities, including young voters, with the economy and jobs being more pressing concerns. While Democrats have emphasized climate action, it hasn't translated into increased voter support, and voters already recognize the party's commitment to the issue. Prioritizing climate change risks alienating voters more concerned with cost of living and economic issues, potentially undermining Democrats' credibility on these bread-and-butter topics.</p>

          <p>A landmark antitrust trial against Meta, formerly Facebook, is examining whether the company illegally stifled competition through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argues that Meta is a monopolist in personal social networking, narrowly defined as connecting friends and family, while Meta contends that it competes with all social media companies, including TikTok and YouTube. Executives from various social media companies have struggled to define the industry's market, highlighting the evolving and complex nature of social networking. The judge's decision will have significant implications for tech market regulation and the acquisition strategies of major tech firms.</p>

However, the agreement leaves key issues unresolved, including pharmaceuticals and the UK's digital services tax.
