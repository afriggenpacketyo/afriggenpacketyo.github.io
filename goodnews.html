          <p>A heated skirmish broke out between Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Quinyon Mitchell and Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive lineman Tristan Wirfs during their Sunday game. The incident occurred in the first quarter after a near-interception, leading to pushing and shoving between several players from both teams. Mitchell was seen removing Wirfs' helmet during the confrontation, though surprisingly, no penalties were issued to either player involved in the direct altercation. The game, featuring two undefeated teams, continued after an unrelated penalty was called on the Eagles.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has stated he is confident that a new deal effectively separates TikTok's U.S. operations from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, addressing national security concerns. The arrangement, approved via an executive order by President Trump, establishes a new joint-venture company to oversee TikTok's American business, with ByteDance holding less than a 20% stake. Vance emphasized that this structure ensures American control over user data and the platform's algorithm, preventing its use as a propaganda tool by a foreign government. The deal involves investors like Oracle and Silver Lake.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against Harris English of the U.S. due to a neck injury. As per Ryder Cup rules, the match was declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. This development shifts the overall score to 12-5 in favor of Europe, meaning the team now needs only two and a half more points from the remaining 11 matches to win the tournament outright. Hovland's injury flared up on Saturday, and he was unable to recover in time for the final day's play.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Voters Narrowly Approve Government-Managed Digital ID System</h2>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% in favor. This revised proposal addresses privacy concerns that led to the rejection of a similar plan in 2021 by ensuring data is stored only on users' smartphones and the system is state-controlled. The digital ID will be optional, allowing citizens to continue using traditional identity cards. Supporters believe it will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential data misuse and the erosion of privacy.</p>

          <p>Residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to impose severe restrictions on the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. The measure, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to the months of October through December. Supporters argued that the machines are disruptive, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, advocating for the use of traditional rakes. Opponents of the ban criticized it as an example of an excessive "culture of prohibition" that would create unnecessary difficulties.</p>
