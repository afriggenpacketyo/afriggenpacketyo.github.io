          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended for several hours on Tuesday after a train stopped between stations. The train, which was not in service, halted in Tochigi Prefecture due to a malfunction, causing two other trains to stop as well. Passengers on one of the halted trains were transferred to another train using a gangplank, while the other train returned to Utsunomiya Station. Service between Tokyo and Sendai stations on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line resumed later in the day after inspections and repairs were completed.</p>

          <p>Will Smith has described the fallout from slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars as "brutal," leading to deep reflection over the past few years. Smith says he had to confront his addiction to the approval of others and shut down for a period for internal work. The actor was banned from the awards ceremony for 10 years after the incident, which he described as "shocking, painful, and inexcusable." Smith has since released his first album in 20 years, seeking advice from Jay Z and Kendrick Lamar during the writing process, with the new music offering an exploration of personal authenticity and imperfection.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Charles Schwab found that 90% of women investors believe they are "on the right track" to achieve their financial goals. However, 85% of these women share a common regret: they wish they had started investing earlier in life. The survey, which polled 1,200 women with at least $5,000 in investable assets, identified a lack of financial knowledge and limited funds as primary reasons for delaying investment. Financial experts emphasize the importance of starting early to harness the power of compounding, regardless of the initial investment amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amy Wadge, co-writer of Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," expressed immense relief as the US Supreme Court rejected an attempt to revive the copyright trial over the song. The case, initiated by Structured Asset Sales (SAS), claimed that Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On." The Supreme Court's decision effectively ends a decade-long legal battle, with previous rulings already in Sheeran's favor. Wadge described the copyright trials as having "haunted" her for the last 10 years, emphasizing the significant impact the song had on her life and career.</p>

          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo prior to the Club World Cup would have been "completely counter-intuitive" due to his affiliation with their rival club, Al-Nassr. Despite FIFA introducing an additional transfer window, Al-Hilal opted against pursuing Ronaldo, citing his status as a key player for their biggest opponent. The executive emphasized that any reinforcement decisions must consider long-term implications, making a short-term loan for Ronaldo impractical. Al-Hilal remains open to reinforcing the team during the traditional transfer window after the tournament.</p>

The report emphasizes that the sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations. China's private sector, contributing significantly to GDP and employment, is receiving renewed support amid intensifying economic rivalry with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
