          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before the panel. A committee spokesperson stated that Mueller is facing health issues that prevent him from testifying. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller as part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, citing Mueller's tenure as FBI director during the time Epstein was under investigation. However, Mueller's family informed The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease, making it difficult for him to appear before Congress. This decision marks the end of a potential public hearing involving the former special counsel. </p>

The group's warplanes, adorned with shark mouths, symbolized fierceness in combat, credited with destroying numerous Japanese planes while sustaining minimal losses. The daughter and granddaughter of the Flying Tigers' founder were invited to China's military parade commemorating the end of World War II. The AVG's formation in the late 1930s involved American pilots, mechanics, and support personnel, recruited by Claire Chennault to defend China against Japan. This historical bond remains strong, with museums and exhibits dedicated to the Flying Tigers in China. </p>

          <p>ScotRail has permanently eliminated peak-time fares, offering cheaper travel for many passengers and aiming to encourage more commuters to use trains. The change, effective September 1, will result in significant savings, such as a nearly 50% reduction on tickets from Edinburgh to Glasgow. The policy, championed by the Scottish Greens, was initially introduced as a pilot scheme in 2023 but ended due to budget pressures. First Minister John Swinney announced the reinstatement of the policy, citing improved financial stability and calls from commuters and climate activists. The move is expected to put more money in people's pockets and reduce carbon emissions. </p>
