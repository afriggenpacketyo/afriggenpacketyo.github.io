          <h2>NYC Mayoral Race Outcome Uncertain Due to Ranked-Choice Voting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 22:05:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's mayoral primary race is still undecided due to the implementation of ranked-choice voting. Initial tallies show Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani with a slight lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, but the final outcome hinges on the ranked-choice tabulation process. Mamdani, endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, gained momentum late in the race, while Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, seeks a political comeback. Ranked-choice voting, first used in the 2021 mayoral primary, allows voters to rank up to five candidates, with rounds of elimination and redistribution of votes until a candidate secures over 50%.</p>

          <p>A California man, Andrew Biscay, was arrested for allegedly impersonating a U.S. Marshal and possessing a makeshift weapon. Madera County Sheriff's deputies discovered a collection of crude law enforcement equipment and outfits, including a self-manufactured firearm, zip ties, a baton, and a fake U.S. Marshal's uniform, during a vehicle search following a family disturbance report. The arrest follows similar incidents in other states where individuals have posed as law enforcement officers.

The committee emphasizes the importance of ensuring households benefit from cleaner technologies through reduced energy bills.

The CCC suggests making electricity cheaper by removing charges added to bills for renewable energy projects and efficiency upgrades.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of stars nearing the end of their lives to study the formation of suns. The research indicates that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study provides direct evidence that the Milky Way‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>China is implementing new strategies to encourage foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar as international confidence in the greenback declines (not investment advice). These efforts include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Recent moves focus on expanding the futures market and allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. Despite these efforts, China's strict capital controls and relatively opaque system continue to discourage large-scale investment in mainland China assets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved an updated policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones on routine emergency calls, citing successes seen in other police departments. The new guidelines list other scenarios for future drone use including ‚Äúhigh-risk incident, investigative purpose, large-scale event, natural disaster.‚Äù The policy change aims to provide officers with real-time information about potential threats. The pilot program will launch next month at four police divisions, and the department will report back within six months on its progress.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, for the first time since 2014. This dog-sized dinosaur, which lived about 150 million years ago, was previously misclassified as a Nanosaurus. Its new name, Enigmacursor, means puzzling runner, reflecting its unique characteristics. The discovery promises to shed light on the evolutionary history of small dinosaurs and their transition to larger forms.</p>
