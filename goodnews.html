          <p>The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee has recommended redoing the vice-chair elections due to complaints about the balloting process, potentially jeopardizing the positions of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta. The recommendation followed a challenge filed by vice-chair candidate Kalyn Free, who argued that the voting process unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta. Hogg claimed the vote was influenced by his efforts to reform the party, while Kenyatta expressed frustration at the focus on Hogg. The decision now goes to the entire DNC for a vote. </p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be the lowest in five years, according to new estimates. Analysts predict a COLA of 2.4%, lower than the previous year's increase. The adjustment, calculated based on third-quarter inflation data, provides an annual benefit increase for Social Security beneficiaries. The CPI-W, used to calculate Social Security's COLA, increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's broad tariffs, financial markets have shown limited reaction, with stocks higher than before the tariffs were imposed. While investors remain cautious, they acknowledge uncertainty regarding the final level of tariffs. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, unwilling to lower interest rates until the inflationary effect of the tariffs is known. Uncertainty continues to impact business investment and consumer spending, potentially slowing economic growth. (not investment advice) </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of high tariffs, inflation slowed in April, leading to questions about the immediate economic impact. Experts suggest that companies had stocked up on foreign goods before the tariffs took effect, delaying price increases. However, analysts predict that consumer prices will eventually rise as companies deplete their inventories. While a potential trade agreement with China could alleviate some concerns, the risk of disrupted supply chains and shortages remains, potentially leading to an inflationary cycle. </p>
