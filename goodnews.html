          <p>Following the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea is seeking a more balanced foreign policy approach. Society remains divided, and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to find a stable presidential candidate. Opposition Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls, having shifted towards the center to appeal to undecided conservative voters. While economic concerns are paramount, foreign policy demands equal attention due to South Korea's geopolitical position.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Style Focuses on Child's Emotional Needs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:19:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert has developed a new framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes a child's emotional needs and focuses on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without rushing to fix them, responding without shaming, and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to become less reactive, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. The method involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress in battling the Inn fire, a brush fire in Mono County near Yosemite National Park and Mammoth Mountain. The fire, which began on Thursday, prompted evacuations in Mono City and Lundy Canyon but improved weather conditions allowed for reopening Highway 395 to one-way traffic and downgrading evacuation orders to advisories. Containment increased from 0% to 15% overnight, with crews clearing lines and digging containment lines. Mild weather is expected in the coming days, and officials are urging caution and patience as visitors head to the area for the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave out Man City midfielder Jack Grealish. It is known that Kevin de Bruyne played his final game against the Cottagers, bringing to an end a trophy-laden decade at the club. The team is looking to transition off the pitch too, with Guardiola's long-time associate Begiristain, who he has enjoyed so much success with at both City and Barcelona, will leave this summer and Viana has already started as the new director of football. One player they won't be moving for - at this stage - is Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz owning to the cost of doing a deal, but Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White remains of interest while AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders has been heavily linked, external with a move to Etihad Stadium.</p>

Verstappen said: "Less low-speed corners, more high-speed, Hopefully, that will suit the car a bit better. It should be, yeah. I'm sure, well, I hope. Because if we're 0.7 seconds a lap behind in Barcelona, that would not be good."</p>
