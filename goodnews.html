          <p>Oracle has announced the promotion of Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to co-CEOs, with current CEO Safra Catz transitioning to executive vice chair. Magouyrk, formerly cloud infrastructure president, and Sicilia, who led industry applications, are credited by founder Larry Ellison for their AI focus, which has significantly boosted Oracle's cloud business. This leadership change comes as Oracle's stock surged 85% this year, benefiting from the AI boom and its Nvidia GPU access. The company also reaffirmed strong financial guidance, with remaining performance obligations soaring to $455 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's crude oil imports from Russia decreased by 15.2% year-on-year in August, totaling 7.94 million tonnes. This dip was, however, largely offset by increased purchases from other nations like Brazil and Indonesia, keeping overall imports steady. Analysts are debating whether this is a temporary fluctuation, possibly due to maintenance at Russia's Sakhalin-1 project, or a sign of a broader trend. Meanwhile, China's oil purchases from the US remained suspended for the third consecutive month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Edith Cowan University indicates that both resistance training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can help combat breast cancer. The study, published in Springer Nature, found that a single session of either exercise increased anti-cancer myokines, proteins produced by muscles, reducing cancer cell growth by 20% to 30%. This highlights exercise's potential as a therapeutic intervention in cancer care, with intensity being a critical factor. Researchers encourage cancer patients to exercise regularly to boost these cancer-suppressing molecules.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut, with potential for more in 2025, is anticipated to reduce returns on savings accounts. Some online banks have already lowered their rates, prompting financial experts to suggest locking in higher rates now. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are highlighted as a good option for securing returns, with some still offering 4% rates that extend into next year. Savers should prioritize liquidity for emergency funds while considering CDs for long-term, conservative growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has granted a presidential pardon to British-Egyptian activist and blogger Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who remained in custody despite his sentence ending. This decision follows international pressure and a recent court removal from the country's terrorism list. Abd el-Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, was sentenced in 2021 for "spreading false news." His release removes a high-profile dissident from Egypt's prison system, though many other activists remain detained.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average mortgage interest rates have recently fallen to a three-year low, prompting speculation about further drops this fall. Lending experts suggest that while the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point cut was largely priced in, future Fed actions and a cooling economic landscape could lead to a continued, albeit modest, downward trend. Forecasts anticipate rates settling around 6.0-6.2% by year-end, which could make homeownership more affordable for millions. Borrowers are advised to consider pre-approval and rate lock options.

          <p>A psychology expert suggests five phrases to politely yet firmly decline unsolicited advice, which can undermine self-efficacy and confidence. Research indicates that unasked-for guidance can make individuals feel incapable of managing challenges, impacting motivation and resilience. The recommended responses, such as "Thanks for sharing. I'll consider it" or "Right now I'd really value support more than solutions," help acknowledge input while maintaining personal autonomy. The article emphasizes the importance of tone and guiding the conversation towards needed emotional support rather than solutions.</p>
