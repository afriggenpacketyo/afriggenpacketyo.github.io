          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace beyond April next year, while keeping its interest rate unchanged at 0.5%. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen ($1.4 billion) per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with total purchases declining to about 2 trillion yen in early 2027. Amid uncertainties surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, the BOJ maintained its benchmark policy rate at its two-day meeting. The decision to review the pace of paring bond-buying comes after yields on super long-term government bonds surged last month due to concerns about Japan's fiscal health (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Gold has emerged as the leading safe-haven asset, outperforming traditional options like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices increasing by 30% in 2025. Experts attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, as investors become wary of fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions. Concerns over U.S. fiscal discipline, highlighted by President Trump's tariffs and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating, have further fueled interest in alternative safe havens like gold. While the dollar and U.S. Treasurys have historically been reliable, recent policy volatility has compromised confidence in U.S. assets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that directives from the Trump administration, which led to the cancellation of several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), were "void" and "illegal." The judge determined that the cancellation of grants related to LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) violated federal law, constituting discrimination. The NIH has been ordered to restore the terminated grants, estimated to be up to $1.8 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stands by its decision and is exploring legal options, including an appeal. </p>

          <p>The Bank of England (BoE) is widely expected to maintain interest rates at 4.25% this week, as policymakers assess geopolitical risks, persistent inflation, and conflicting domestic economic data.

Rising oil prices and a stronger pound further complicate the inflation outlook, while the UK economy contracted in April and wage growth has slowed.

The team, led by Wu Jian and Liu Chao, developed a solution combining adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR) to overcome these challenges.
