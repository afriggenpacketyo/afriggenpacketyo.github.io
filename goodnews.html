          <p>Golfer Hunter Mahan offered a lighthearted critique of the Quail Hollow Club, the venue for this year's PGA Championship, comparing it to a Kardashian for being modern, beautiful, and well-kept, but lacking soul or character. Other golfers, like Dean Burmester, have described the course as a "monster," adding to the anticipation for the tournament. The PGA Championship changes courses each year, but Quail Hollow has hosted the Wells Fargo Championship and the 2022 Presidents Cup, making it familiar to many golfers. The article mentions that Xander Schauffele won last year's PGA Championship.</p>

Her research has contributed to Brazil becoming a major agricultural power, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is considering removing prescription fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing concerns about the impact of ingested fluoride on the human microbiome. This move contradicts recommendations from the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and professional medical associations, which support low-dose fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water. Critics argue that the ban would remove a valuable tool for dentists in preventing cavities, while the FDA claims the action is based on safety concerns, despite inconclusive research on the effects of low doses of fluoride.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly below economists' expectations, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decline. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the effects may not be immediately visible in economic data. The CPI data may influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding interest rate cuts, potentially delaying relief on borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order that establishes a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily reduce the cost of prescription drugs or face new restrictions on what the government will pay. The order requests the health department, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to negotiate new prices for drugs during the next month. If no agreements are reached, Kennedy will be tasked with developing a new rule that links the price the government pays for drugs to the lowest prices paid by other countries.</p>

          <h2>Scotland's Assisted Dying Bill Receives Initial Backing, Faces Further Scrutiny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 17:51:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Parliament has given initial backing to legislation to legalise assisted dying. A bill tabled by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur passed its first parliamentary vote by 70 to 56, with one abstention. A number of MSPs who voted for the proposal voiced reservations and said they wanted to see changes made. Many members were clear that this is far from a full stop. A lot more work is still to be done on this legislation. It was also clear that many felt the pressure of making a decision which is literally about life and death.</p>
