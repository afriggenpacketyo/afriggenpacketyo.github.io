          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, emphasizing the department's need to fulfill its obligations as mandated by Congress. This order follows the Education Department's announcement on March 11 of a reduction in force that would have significantly cut the agency's staff. The decision comes after multiple lawsuits were filed against the Trump administration, including one by 21 states, challenging the staff cuts. Optimism score is 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed the "Big, Beautiful Bill," resulting in several winners and losers, with some experiencing mixed outcomes. The House Freedom Caucus gained influence by shifting Medicaid Work Requirements to take effect earlier than initially proposed. Blue-state Republicans secured a higher State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) for their constituents, while President Trump saw his tax cuts preserved. However, the bill's passage contributes to the national debt and deficit, leading to criticism from Democratic leadership and concerns over cuts to green energy tax credits and abortion provider funding. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>The House has passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 for individuals and phasing it out for incomes over $500,000. This provision, set to take effect in 2025, aims to provide tax relief to residents in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. However, the revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap, and the proposal may face opposition in the Senate.

Parents can contribute up to $5,000 annually, with earnings growing tax-deferred and withdrawals taxed at long-term capital gains rates.

          <p>In times of frustration and cynicism, seeking moral beauty in acts of charity, kindness, and self-sacrifice can provide a path to happiness.

Ways to cultivate moral beauty include spending time with generous people, dedicating leisure time to serving others, and practicing gratitude. Conversely, focusing on moral depravity and true crime may arrest the effects of moral beauty and lead to depression. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <h2>Treasury to Discontinue Penny Minting</h2>

          <p>The Treasury Department plans to stop minting pennies, aiming to save money due to the high cost of production, which is nearly four cents per coin. This decision follows President Trump's call to phase out the one-cent coins, citing wastefulness. While pennies will remain legal tender, the phase-out may require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel. The Treasury Secretary is exploring ways to reduce the cost of minting nickels, which currently exceeds their face value. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <h2>Net Migration Halved in 2024 Due to Changes in Work Visas and Students</h2>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. Separate data showed a decrease in asylum seekers being housed in hotels, and an increase in the number of people being returned to their home countries. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway awoke to discover a 440-foot container ship had run aground just meters from his house. Johan Helberg was alerted to the incident by a neighbor who had tried to ring his doorbell but couldn't get him to answer. The ship, the NCL Salten, caused damage to a heating pipe in Helberg's cabin, but no one was injured. The cause of the incident is being investigated, and the ship is awaiting refloating. Optimism score is 85.</p>
