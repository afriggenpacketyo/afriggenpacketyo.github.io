          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has become the head of four government bodies, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, acting archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and interim national security advisor. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his ability to effectively manage all these positions, especially with Steve Witkoff handling sensitive diplomacy. The sudden announcement of Rubio's newest position surprised even State Department officials, highlighting the unconventional nature of the Trump administration. Rubio's multiple roles reflect the trust placed in him by President Trump and his close relationship with Susie Wiles, Trump‚Äôs chief of staff.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him to be the ambassador to the United Nations. The decision followed criticism after Waltz mistakenly added a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz. Some sources suggest that Waltz was ousted due to the Signal situation and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff. Vice President JD Vance has publicly defended the move as a promotion.</p>

          <p>Apple plans to shift the production of iPhones sold in the U.S. from China to India to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs. iPads will be sourced from Vietnam. CEO Tim Cook believes the tariffs will add significant costs during the current quarter. Despite these changes, devices sold outside the U.S. will continue to be made in China. Apple's sales in China fell 2.3% between January and March. Cook emphasized the importance of diversifying the supply chain to reduce risk.</p>
