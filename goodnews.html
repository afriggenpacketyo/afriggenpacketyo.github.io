          <p>Oracle experienced a historic stock surge, climbing nearly 36% after the company reported an unprecedented $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, indicating massive future cloud demand. This performance marked the company's best single trading day since 1992 and added approximately $244 billion to its market capitalization. The dramatic increase is attributed to Oracle's growing role as a key infrastructure provider for artificial intelligence workloads, securing major contracts with leading AI companies. The surge also significantly boosted the net worth of founder Larry Ellison, who saw a personal wealth increase of around $100 billion in one day. (not investment advice)</p>

The victory comes after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" program following 26 years as its host. In his acceptance speech, Lineker thanked his colleagues and stated the public-voted award demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for those without a voice.

          <p>NASA has announced a significant finding from its Perseverance rover on Mars, which has collected a rock sample containing what researchers are calling "potential biosignatures." The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was taken from the edge of an ancient river valley within Jezero Crater, a location believed to have once held a lake. Analysis of the rock revealed textures and mineral compositions, including iron, phosphorus, and sulfur, that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While non-biological origins cannot be ruled out, scientists are excited by the discovery, which brings them closer to answering whether life ever existed on Mars.</p>

Klarna's successful debut is the latest in a series of strong tech listings this year, indicating robust investor appetite for new offerings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for 2026 World Cup tickets, calling it an "affront to the game." Mamdani argues that the pricing model, which allows ticket costs to fluctuate based on demand, will make the event unaffordable for many genuine fans and prioritize profit over accessibility. The petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and for 15% of tickets to be reserved for local residents. He contrasted current prices with the 1994 World Cup, where tickets were significantly more accessible.</p>

          <h2>Planned Weekend Bus Strike in London Largely Averted After Pay Deal</h2>

          <p>A disruptive bus strike planned for the upcoming weekend in London has been mostly called off after a majority of workers accepted a new pay offer. The Unite union confirmed that employees of London United, one of the two bus companies involved, voted to accept the deal, canceling their walkout. The strike was set to affect approximately 60 routes across north-west and south-west London. However, some industrial action may still proceed on a smaller number of routes operated by London Transit if ongoing negotiations with that company do not result in an agreement. The resolution averts wider travel chaos for Londoners.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative five-year labor agreement with the union representing over 3,000 striking defense workers, potentially ending a walkout that began in early August. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union announced that the proposed deal includes improved wages and the restoration of a signing bonus. Union members, who are primarily based in St. Louis and work on F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, will vote on the new contract this Friday. The strike was the first in nearly three decades for this unit, which had previously rejected an offer that included a 20% wage increase.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, actor Charlie Sheen reflected on a pivotal moment in his struggle with substance abuse when his family staged an intervention for him in the early 1990s. Sheen recalled being lured to what he thought was his father Martin Sheen's 50th birthday party, only to find a group of friends and family gathered to confront him about his addiction. After listening to emotional appeals, Sheen was still hesitant to enter rehab until his father handed him the phone. On the line was actor and director Clint Eastwood, who offered powerful words of encouragement that ultimately convinced Sheen to seek treatment.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are evaluating the best placement for their funds between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A key difference is that CDs offer a fixed interest rate, which protects savers from declining returns if they lock in a rate before the cut. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely fall following the Fed's action, reducing their earning potential. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals: CDs provide guaranteed returns but limit access to funds, while savings accounts offer flexibility but are subject to rate volatility.

The top three causes of death last year were heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries. Despite the overall positive trend in mortality, the number of deaths from both heart disease and cancer increased compared to the previous year.
