          <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that the aviation industry's profitability will improve in 2025, despite a forecasted drop in global GDP growth. The IATA report anticipates increases in revenue, operating profits, and net profits for the industry, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year, as fleet expansion faces challenges due to supply chain issues. Jet fuel costs are projected to average $86 per barrel in 2025, a decrease from $99 in 2024, resulting in a lower total fuel bill for airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many of the UK's front pages focus on the government's strategic defence review, with some outlets highlighting the UK's warning to Putin through the unveiling of new attack submarines. The Telegraph suggests the defence strategy is in "disarray" due to the defence secretary seemingly backtracking on a pledge to boost military spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. Several papers also spotlight the record number of migrants crossing the English Channel, quoting the defence secretary as saying boats were arriving like taxis. Other headlines include a study suggesting exercise is better than drugs for cancer prevention and the fifth anniversary of the organ donor opt-out law in England.</p>

          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after the announcement of a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. A new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating a merged entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, simplifying the structure and creating a more investable company. (not investment advice)</p>
