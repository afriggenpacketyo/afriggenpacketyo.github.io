        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses and improving workers' skills. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from some green energy levies, potentially cutting their energy bills by up to 25%. Other measures include investing an extra ¬£1.2 billion annually in skills training, attracting global talent through visa reforms, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending, particularly in sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies. While some business groups welcomed the strategy, others, like the hospitality sector, expressed disappointment at being excluded from the plan. Optimism in the sector may depend on whether these efforts will truly boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman's remarks align with fellow Governor Christopher Waller, who also suggested the Fed could consider cutting rates in July. Bowman believes that President Trump's tariffs are likely to have a temporary and muted impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates to sustain a healthy labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet July 29-30, with futures market pricing currently assigning a 23% probability to a rate cut at that meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

Japan, which relies heavily on the Middle East for crude oil, continues to monitor the impact of the conflict on its energy supply, particularly concerning potential closures of the Strait of Hormuz.

          <p>As homeowners increasingly consider home equity loans amid settled interest rates, experts caution about the risks of taking on excessive debt.

Red flags include a high debt-to-income ratio, low credit score, low home equity, unstable income, and lack of an emergency fund.
