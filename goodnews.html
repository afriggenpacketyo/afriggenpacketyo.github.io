          <p>Alan Yentob, the long-serving BBC arts broadcaster and documentary-maker, has died at the age of 78.

He also served as controller of BBC One and Two, and as the organization's creative director, championing originality and artistic ambition. His 1975 Omnibus feature, Cracked Actor, showcased David Bowie during an intensely creative but fragile period in the singer's life.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, and fostering trust through open conversations. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents prioritize their own inner healing and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically. By setting boundaries with empathy and reconnecting after conflicts, parents can model healthy emotional repair and promote strong communication.</p>

Her efforts led to a significant shift in Army culture, providing comfort and respect to grieving families. The Army post was re-named Ft. Benning and is now called Ft.

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister. This expectation follows the dismissal of the previous minister due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The survey also reveals that 44.7% believe rice prices should be reduced below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, lower than the target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey also showed that Koizumi plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers in order to bypass auctions that have prevented government control over prices.</p>
