        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing significant financial losses and a sharp decline in ridership, public bus companies across China are adopting innovative business models to stay afloat. With passenger volume at just over half of pre-pandemic levels, companies like Zhengzhou Public Transport Group are partnering with courier services to use idle buses for deliveries. Other unorthodox strategies include repurposing buses to allow pets as passengers. These moves highlight the severe economic pressures on traditional public transit as commuters increasingly shift to other transportation methods.</p>

          <p>Telegram has rolled out its TON Wallet to its 87 million users in the United States, allowing them to manage cryptocurrency directly within the messaging app. The self-custodial wallet, built on the TON blockchain, enables peer-to-peer transfers, token swaps, and purchases without needing a separate app or login. This integration marks the first time a self-custodial crypto wallet has been embedded into a major messaging platform in the U.S. market. The company aims to reduce friction in crypto transactions and could increase competition for established payment platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Businesses are continuing to fund corporate travel, but they are becoming more strategic with their spending due to trade tensions and economic uncertainty. A new report shows that while overall spending increased 15% year-over-year, growth is more moderate than previously forecast. Companies are prioritizing essential, relationship-building trips, such as individual client meetings, while cutting back on larger group outings. This cautious approach reflects a "wait and see" mode among C-suite leaders, who are focused on ensuring every trip delivers a clear return on investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has restructured the leadership of its advanced technology research group, which focuses on emerging fields like quantum computing. The bank has hired Rob Otter, formerly the head of digital technology and quantum computing at State Street, to lead the group. This change follows the departure of the previous head, Marco Pistoia, an ex-IBM inventor who had led the team since 2020. The move underscores the ongoing strategic importance of quantum computing in the financial sector, as major institutions race to harness its potential for solving complex financial problems.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union, caught between US trade pressure and Chinese economic influence, has a unique opportunity to redefine its strategic course. With the US threatening significant tariffs, the EU could leverage its upcoming summit with China to improve its bargaining position with both superpowers. The author suggests the EU should pragmatically re-evaluate its alignment with US tech restrictions on China, especially as the US itself is relaxing some controls. By doing so, the EU could potentially secure better trade terms and navigate the complex geopolitical landscape more effectively.</p>

After a review confirmed the contact, Sosa was awarded first base, forcing in the winning run. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971, providing a strange and memorable conclusion to the contest.</p>

The novel challenges the sentimental myth of childhood friends, revealing the secrets and misunderstandings at the core of their bond. The story follows the characters from their school days into their adult lives in the New York art world, where their unhealthy patterns of obsession and codependence persist.
