        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has signaled its readiness to collaborate with the United States on combating fentanyl trafficking and repatriating illegal immigrants, two key priorities for the U.S. government. Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong emphasized the need for "mutual respect" from Washington and expressed hope that the US could meet China halfway in fostering bilateral relations. Last year, Beijing and Washington held several meetings to discuss closer cooperation, and law enforcement agencies established anti-drug hotlines to share information. This development indicates a potential thaw in relations between the two countries on specific law enforcement issues. The optimism score is based on the potential for improved cooperation.</p>

          <p>AI-generated avatars are demonstrating their potential as highly effective influencers, as shown by a recent collaboration between Chinese tech company Baidu and livestreamer Luo Yonghao. Luo and his co-host used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers on Baidu's e-commerce livestreaming platform, generating significant revenue. The avatars, built using Baidu's generative AI model, mimicked the hosts' jokes and style based on years of video data. This success suggests a growing role for AI in marketing and e-commerce, offering new possibilities for personalized and engaging customer interactions. The optimism score is based on the potential for AI in marketing.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2¬Ω times. The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying rot in various fruits. The low-cost coating was tested across 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberry, tomato, kiwi, and mango. The new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity.
