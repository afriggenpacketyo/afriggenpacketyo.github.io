          <p>Following their successful passing of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have announced substantial increases to their quarterly dividends. Goldman Sachs raised its payout by 33% to $4 per share, while Wells Fargo increased its dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents per share, sending both companies' stock prices to record highs. These hikes are part of a broader trend among major corporations in 2025, signaling strong management confidence in future cash flow and profitability. Such increases in shareholder returns are generally viewed as a positive indicator for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Corey Parchman is raising awareness about male infertility with his new book, "IVF Playbook for Men," which details his personal struggles and the lack of resources available for men. Parchman and his wife endured a difficult two-and-a-half-year journey with IVF before welcoming their son, a process during which he felt like the "weakest link." He advocates for men to be more open and vulnerable about their feelings and emphasizes the importance of communication and mutual support between partners. The book aims to serve as a guide and resource for men navigating the emotional and practical challenges of fertility treatments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is reviving a decades-old strategy to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae can devastate livestock and wildlife. The plan involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control method is considered more effective and environmentally friendly than pesticides and is being ramped up in response to the pest's recent reappearance in southern Mexico.</p>

          <p>British university student and world number 733 Ollie Tarvet saw his dream run at Wimbledon come to an end in the second round against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Despite the straight-sets loss, the 21-year-old qualifier put up an entertaining and spirited fight on Centre Court, earning praise from Alcaraz for his performance. Tarvet's unexpected success, which included three qualifying wins and a first-round victory, has brought him significant attention. However, due to American college sports rules, he is only permitted to keep a small portion of his ¬£99,000 prize money.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst concerns over the aging U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system and recent outages, airlines and pilots are highlighting their extensive training for handling such disruptions. Pilots are trained from early in their careers to manage communication loss by using backup radio frequencies, emergency channels, and text-based systems. Modern aircraft are also equipped with collision avoidance systems (TCAS) that provide an independent layer of safety by scanning for other planes. While ATC outages can cause significant delays and inconvenience for passengers, industry professionals maintain that multiple layers of redundancy ensure that safety is not compromised.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports to the United States. In return, U.S. exports will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets. The deal also includes a 40% levy on goods that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries to circumvent trade barriers, a practice often associated with Chinese goods. This agreement sets a lower tariff rate than the 46% initially proposed by Trump, reflecting ongoing negotiations as the administration re-evaluates its global tariff policies.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, presents several timely advantages for those looking to diversify their portfolios. As a tangible asset, gold offers a sense of security and control that is absent from more volatile market investments. The article notes that buying and selling physical gold has become increasingly accessible through various retailers and online platforms. Furthermore, investors can purchase fractional gold bars and coins, allowing them to enter the market at a lower price point while still benefiting from gold's traditional role as a hedge against inflation.
