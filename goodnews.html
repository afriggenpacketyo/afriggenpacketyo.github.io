          <p>Ohio authorities have arrested Gregory J. Moore, Aliza Sherman's former divorce attorney, and charged him with murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy in connection to her 2013 stabbing death.

          <p>A mainland Chinese military magazine reports that Beijing's sixth-generation fighter, unofficially dubbed the J-36, could potentially block airspace to foreign bases in Guam for up to two hours from 1,000km away in a future conflict over Taiwan. The goal of the next-gen fighter is to counter People‚Äôs Liberation Army weaknesses against the American B-21 stealth bomber within the first island chain. The article in Shipborne Weapons suggests that this fighter could impede the US Navy and Air Force from maintaining air superiority over the western Pacific. The Chinese stealth aircraft is undergoing flight tests near Chengdu, while the US also announced its sixth-generation fighter, the F-47, in March.</p>

          <h2>How Speaking Multiple Languages Changes Your Brain</h2>

          <p>Learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, such as memory and problem-solving skills. Research shows that learning languages benefits overall brain health, reshaping neural pathways and increasing gray matter structure in areas related to language processing. While young children's brains are more adaptable to neural plasticity, adults can also benefit from language learning, which enhances connectivity between brain regions. Although multilingualism improves cognitive abilities, it is unclear if this directly translates to higher intelligence, as various factors influence cognitive skills.</p>
