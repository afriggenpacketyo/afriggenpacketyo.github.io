          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profit, which was impacted by Southern California wildfires. The conglomerate also cited a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange as the dollar weakened. Warren Buffett warned that tariffs may further impact profits, adding uncertainty to the company's outlook. Despite these challenges, Berkshire's cash pile grew to a record $347 billion as the company continued its defensive strategy of selling stocks, reducing its holdings in Apple and Bank of America.

          <p>Several German states are considering banning smartphones in schools, with one high school in North Rhine-Westphalia already trialing the initiative.
