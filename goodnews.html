          <p>A Southern California family, seeking a supportive "village" for their twin boys, found Janet Firestein Daw through Surrogate Grandparents USA, a Facebook group. Daw, who desired grandchildren and wanted to engage in activities like playing Legos, connected immediately with the Turners, affectionately becoming "Nana J" and a full part of their family. This unique arrangement has brought immense relief and a sense of completion to the Turners, while also filling a lifelong void for Daw, who later welcomed a biological grandchild but whose love for the boys remained unchanged. The article highlights the growing trend of such unconventional family formations, emphasizing the importance of parental discretion and safety when meeting online.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's moral dilemma about caring for an aging, previously unkind stepfather who lives nearby and has no other family. The columnist, James Parker, despite admitting his own jaundiced nature, advocates for rising above "petty grievances" and showing kindness. He suggests viewing this act as a "rebalancing of the scales," portraying it as a form of "revenge" served graciously through a casserole. The article emphasizes that actively ignoring someone is stressful and that showing generosity can be liberating, especially when the former antagonist has lost their power and cannot pluck "deep bass strings of neurosis."</p>

England bowlers Sophie Ecclestone and Lauren Filer were instrumental in restricting the Rockets, taking 2-12 and 3-23 respectively.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration intends to convert CHIPS Act grants to Intel into a non-voting equity stake for the U.S. government, a move that caused Intel's shares to climb. This initiative aims to ensure American taxpayers benefit from the substantial funding previously committed by the Biden administration, which Lutnick criticized as "free money" given without return. The decision aligns with President Trump's broader goal of reshoring U.S. manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign chip producers, especially as Intel has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom despite heavy spending on new factories like the "Silicon Heartland" in Ohio. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that this stake would not obligate U.S. businesses to purchase Intel chips (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing national security concerns and congressional attempts to ban it, TikTok is proving to be an unexpected and effective tool for U.S. military recruitment, particularly among young American women. This development is significant given the persistent challenges in attracting enough recruits in a tight labor market. The article highlights an irony where an app deemed a security risk is aiding military personnel acquisition. It also notes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who once questioned women's combat roles, has since moderated his views, with all combat positions now open to women, underscoring the military's pragmatic approach to recruitment.</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour is set to return to Donald Trump’s Blue Monster course at Trump National Doral in Miami in 2026, ending a decade-long absence from Trump-owned venues. The Miami Championship, a $20 million Signature Event, will be the first PGA Tour event held at the venue since 2016, when the WGC-Cadillac Championship was relocated amid Trump's polarizing political rise. While the previous departure was framed as a sponsorship issue, the return now expands the Tour's Signature Events roster. This move places Doral back into a prominent position in the golf calendar, signaling a new era of innovation for the Tour.</p>

With current top CD rates hovering around 4%, a $150,000 investment could yield between approximately $1,587 for a three-month term and over $34,000 for a five-year term. CDs offer a stable alternative to volatile stock markets, locking in rates for the entire term and providing FDIC or NCUA insurance.

This decision, confirmed by the Nigerian Foreign Ministry, comes after the U.S. Mission in Nigeria issued its directive, part of broader Trump administration measures to "ensure national security." Nigerian officials stressed that "anything visa is reciprocal," indicating a strong stance against what they perceive as restrictive foreign immigration rules.

The agency warned, however, that the rating could be lowered if high deficits increase due to political inability to contain spending or manage revenue implications from tax code changes. It also cautioned that political developments affecting American institutions or the Federal Reserve's independence could jeopardize the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency (not investment advice).</p>
