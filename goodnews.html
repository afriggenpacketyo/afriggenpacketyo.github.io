          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor, the son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would get the city working again while it tried to rebuild a tax base devastated by the pandemic downturn in commercial real estate. Gainey, the city‚Äôs first Black mayor, faced criticism over constant turnover in police leadership, accusations of fudged budget numbers, and complaints about basic services. O'Connor will face Tony Moreno, the winner of the Republican primary, in the general election in November. </p>

Surgeons describe the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method, developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham, has already been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour.
