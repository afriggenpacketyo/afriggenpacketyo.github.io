          <p>Fifty years after its release, key figures involved in the movie "Jaws" reflect on its challenging production and monumental impact. Actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb recall the difficult shoot on the open ocean, the malfunctioning mechanical shark, and the on-set tensions that unexpectedly contributed to the film's success. Directed by a young Steven Spielberg, the movie defied expectations of failure to become the first summer blockbuster, forever changing Hollywood. The article explores how a notoriously troubled production gave birth to a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru's northern Barranca province, shedding light on the aftermath of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization. The site is believed to have been a strategic trading hub connecting communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers discovered 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential buildings, along with artifacts like clay sculptures and necklaces. This significant find helps explain the societal continuation and adaptation after the Caral civilization was impacted by climate change, highlighting a key period in ancient Peruvian history.</p>

          <p>Originally a gift from France to commemorate the end of slavery, the Statue of Liberty's meaning has transformed into a powerful symbol of immigration. The article traces this evolution, highlighting the influence of Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus" and the opening of Ellis Island. It also examines the shifts in U.S. immigration policy, from the open doors of the early 20th century to the restrictive ethnic quotas of the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, championed by figures like John F. Kennedy, ultimately reshaped the nation, ending the quotas and redefining America as a "nation of immigrants."</p>

          <p>Even as national-level political rhetoric between the U.S. and China grows more heated, many American city and local government officials remain receptive to Chinese investment. According to a leader from the China General Chamber of Commerce, local leaders see Chinese-funded projects, particularly in manufacturing, as vital for stimulating their economies. While potential Chinese investors are wary of the geopolitical climate, the appeal of the wealthy U.S. market persists. This creates a dichotomy where local economic needs for jobs and development often outweigh the broader national security and trade concerns voiced in Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive coach and human behavior expert outlines five seemingly innocuous phrases that can inadvertently make a person appear judgmental, potentially damaging relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can imply the other person is inept or incorrect, while prefaces such as "To be honest…" may suggest prior dishonesty. The article advises replacing these with more collaborative and empathetic alternatives, such as asking curious questions or using "yes, and..." to build on ideas. The goal is to foster trust and open communication by being mindful of both the intent and impact of one's words.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is significantly expanding its political and cultural influence in the Western Balkans, using religion and infrastructure as tools of soft power. The construction of the grand Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey, exemplifies this strategy, which experts describe as part of a broader geopolitical vision. This "infrastructure imperialism" extends beyond religious buildings to include investments in railroads, ports, and hotels across the region and into Central Asia and Africa. These projects, often awarded to companies with ties to President Erdogan, aim to position Turkey as a modern regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire's legacy.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, a place that symbolized freedom in his youth. Traveling to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, now a famous and genteel East Coast resident, confronted the changes wrought by time and progress. Despite his dismay at the decline of the steamboat culture and the provinciality of the river towns, he found profound solace in the pilot house. The experience allowed him to reconnect with his past as a river pilot, a time he considered the most independent and carefree of his life.</p>

          <h2>Metropolitan Police Chief Suggests Football Clubs Should Help Cover Policing Costs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has proposed that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. Arguing for a "polluter pays approach," he questioned why event organizers that require a police presence do not pay for it, instead drawing resources away from local communities. The suggestion comes amid broader calls from Sir Mark for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones to better manage funding and modern threats. This reform is aimed at making policing more efficient amid budget constraints.</p>

          <h2>Review: Animated Film 'The King of Kings' Appeals to Faithful but May Not Attain Broad Crossover Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box office success but struggles to achieve its goal of appealing to non-believers. The movie uses a framing device of Dickens narrating the story to his son, but its on-the-nose evangelism and awkward humor may limit its crossover potential. While it serves as a useful educational tool for Christian families, the film lacks the nuanced character development and storytelling artistry of biblical epics like "The Prince of Egypt." This review suggests it succeeds as faith-based entertainment but misses the opportunity to resonate with a wider audience.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Say Hello to the Bad Guys," chronicles a pivotal moment in professional wrestling history: Hulk Hogan's transformation from an all-American hero into a villain in 1996. This "heel turn" and the formation of the New World Order (nWo) faction represented a major narrative shift that captivated audiences and changed the industry. The book explores how this storyline blurred the lines between fiction and reality, creating a compelling spectacle that resonated deeply with the culture. The review discusses how this moment in wrestling storytelling may have foreshadowed the rise of Trumpism and the erosion of consensus reality.</p>

          <p>In response to low demand, FIFA has dramatically cut ticket prices for the Club World Cup semi-final match between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium. Standard tickets, which were priced as high as $473.90, were reduced to just $13.40. This move follows similar price drops for quarter-final matches in other cities. The use of dynamic pricing for the tournament has led to these significant adjustments, highlighting challenges in filling stadiums for the event. In contrast, prices for the other semi-final featuring Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid remain significantly higher.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a major victor in the recent New York City mayoral primary, enabling the surprising win of progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani. The system allowed multiple like-minded candidates to run without fear of splitting the vote, fostering a more positive, coalition-building campaign instead of a divisive one. By eliminating the "spoiler effect," RCV gave an underdog candidate the space to build momentum and ultimately prove he had majority support. The author posits that the high turnout and positive voter feedback demonstrate that RCV makes elections more engaging and empowering for citizens.</p>
