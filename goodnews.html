          <p>The 2025 Belmont Stakes features a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, with Journalism, Sovereignty, and Baeza competing among eight horses. Journalism, winner of the Preakness, is the morning-line favorite for the Belmont, which will be held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park. Sovereignty, who won the Derby, skipped the Preakness to prepare for the Belmont, while Baeza looks to improve on his third-place Derby finish. The Belmont's distance is shortened to 1 1/4 miles this year, matching the Derby's length. The article provides insight into each horse's background, jockey, and trainer, setting the stage for the final jewel of the Triple Crown. </p>

          <h2>Time Limits on Federal Rental Aid: Examining Delaware's Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit. The Delaware program also includes work requirements and financial coaching, helping recipients save money through flat monthly payments and interest-bearing savings accounts. While some argue time limits encourage turnover and upward mobility, others worry about the potential for homelessness, citing experiences in Washington state where time limits were eventually abandoned. The article highlights the importance of additional support, such as savings accounts and assistance with budgeting, to ensure the success of time-limited rental aid programs. </p>

          <h2>Changing Tastes Among China's Gen Z Impact Liquor Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Gen Z is rewriting the liquor industry as their tastes shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, a town known for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to cater to this new demand. Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to younger consumers, focusing on low-alcohol options. This shift reflects a broader trend of prioritizing self-indulgent experiences over traditional social rituals in alcohol consumption. </p>

          <p>This article examines the controversy surrounding President Trump's plan to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C. While critics express concerns about the cost and potential for intimidation, the author argues that the parade could serve as a patriotic celebration and counter misperceptions about the armed forces. The parade could also help address the military's shrinking recruitment numbers and reconnect veterans with the country. The author acknowledges the risk that Trump may use the event for political purposes but emphasizes the importance of honoring the men and women who defend the United States. </p>
