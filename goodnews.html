After condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Savin relocated the club from Russia to Cyprus, rebuilding it as a hub for the Russian-speaking immigrant community. The club serves as a symbol of unity, bringing together fans from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.

This move reflects the continued investor frenzy for foundational AI model developers, following similar large-scale fundraising by competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. The capital is expected to fund the construction of massive data centers and the acquisition of AI chips needed for developing next-generation AI. The high valuation comes despite controversies surrounding its Grok chatbot and its perceived performance lag compared to rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After months of delays, the Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, a former national security adviser to President Trump, as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The confirmation fills a key diplomatic post that had been vacant for eight months, coming just before the U.N. General Assembly meetings. Waltz's confirmation proceeded despite earlier controversy surrounding a security leak, with supporters arguing he will be a moderating influence. During his hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for U.N. reform while stressing the importance of U.S. engagement to counter China's influence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, citing procedural violations. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page complaint was "repetitive," "superfluous," and failed to provide a "short and plain statement" as required by federal rules. The judge characterized the lawsuit as a platform to "rage against an adversary" rather than a proper legal complaint. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended version, with a spokesperson vowing to continue holding the newspaper accountable.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 13:53:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly three years, providing significant relief to homebuyers. For a $750,000 mortgage, the average monthly payment has dropped by over $450 compared to rates at the beginning of 2025, translating to more than $160,000 in interest savings over a 30-year loan. This rate reduction enhances purchasing power for new buyers and creates attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners. The move signals a policy shift by the Fed amid concerns about a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has advocated for two more interest rate cuts this year, arguing that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be minimal and short-lived. This more dovish stance suggests he believes there is room for easier monetary policy to support a weakening labor market without risking a surge in prices. Kashkari stated he is growing more confident that tariffs will have a "one-time effect" on inflation that will play out over a couple of years. His view contributes to the ongoing debate within the Fed about the appropriate path for monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris and NI Secretary Hilary Benn presented the agreement as the "best, and last, opportunity" to provide truth and justice for victims. The framework has received a mixed reaction but aims to heal a diplomatic rift and move forward on a painful aspect of the peace process.</p>

Her comments represent the clearest signal yet of the government's intentions regarding the policy, which prevents families from claiming benefits for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. The issue has become a key topic in the party's deputy leadership contest, with Phillipson positioning herself as a champion against child poverty.
