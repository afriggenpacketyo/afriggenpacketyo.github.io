          <p>A museum has opened in Brnƒõnec, Czech Republic, at the site of a former textile factory where Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews during World War II. The Museum of Survivors is dedicated to the Holocaust and Jewish history in the region, with the opening coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the end of the war. Daniel L√∂w-Beer, whose family owned the plant before the Nazis seized it, spearheaded the project to restore the site and share the stories of Schindler, his wife Emilie, and the survivors. The museum aims to be a universal place of survivors, where stories can be shared and opinions formed.</p>

          <p>American Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining firm backed by Eric Trump, is set to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The Trump family's crypto interests continue to expand, with the former president previously pledging to make the United States a "bitcoin mining powerhouse." Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive and controversial, with some critics raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>Nicole Eggert, known for her role as Roberta "Summer" Quinn on "Baywatch," discussed the challenges she faced in her dating life due to the show's stigma. Eggert said that people had preconceived notions about her based on her role, making it difficult for them to get to know her. She also admitted that she regretted getting breast implants at 18 to fit the show's image, and has since had multiple surgeries. In January 2024, the actress announced she'd been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>

          <p>A cache of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was accidentally discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court. The documents, intended to propagate Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina, arrived in 1941 aboard a Japanese steamer. Argentinian customs officials initially warned of the threat to Argentina's neutrality, leading to the cargo's seizure. The contents, including propaganda and materials from the National Socialist German Workers' Party, are now being surveyed, digitized, and reviewed to uncover information about the Holocaust and the regime's finances.</p>
