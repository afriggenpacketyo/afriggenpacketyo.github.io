          <p>Hainan, China's southernmost island province, has become a hub for experimental medical treatments in the Lecheng medical special zone. Patients are gaining access to therapies still in clinical trials, including cutting-edge stem cell treatments and gene therapies. One woman with early-stage lung cancer is among the first in China to receive the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse. Lecheng features state-of-the-art hospitals with single-patient suites overlooking tropical gardens, offering a stark contrast to the often crowded conditions of mainland public hospitals.</p>

          <p>Under new government plans, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land handed over to local councils to speed up the construction of new homes. Housebuilders will need to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly fail to meet targets could be denied future permissions and face penalties per unbuilt home. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 to address the housing crisis.</p>
