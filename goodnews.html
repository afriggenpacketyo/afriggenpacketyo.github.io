          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest in Basel is marked by political tensions, particularly due to Israel's participation. Protests included Palestinian flags and accusations against Eurovision for complicity in genocide, reflecting the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) implemented a code of conduct to prevent political statements, but controversies persisted with calls for Israel's exclusion and debates over song content. Despite the political backdrop, the competition features diverse musical acts and languages, with bookmakers favoring ballads and pop arias for potential success. The article covers the political and social dimensions of the Eurovision Song Contest this year.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to curb soaring rice prices. This measure follows a shortfall in rice distribution caused by high temperatures in the summer of 2023 and increased consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage participation in auctions. Despite an increase in the 2024 rice harvest, wholesalers and farmers are suspected of hoarding rice in anticipation of further price hikes.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst forecasts of 0.6%, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the growth to the UK services sector and a significant increase in production. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic strength, noting that it outpaced the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employers' National Insurance payments, calling it a "jobs tax" and warning that the strong growth rate was unlikely to continue.</p>

          <p>Children with hearing impairments in Kosovo struggle at school due to insufficient resources and institutional support. Many parents mistakenly believe that teaching sign language will hinder speech development, further isolating these children. The Kosovar Association of the Deaf (KAD) emphasizes that sign language is the most effective form of communication for most deaf individuals. Psychologist Atifete Syla underscores the importance of sign language for communication and emotional development, while sociologist Flake Ymeri notes the high risk of exclusion from the labor market for those with hearing and speech disabilities.

          <p>Three M캐ori MPs in New Zealand face suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a legislative session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers, recommending suspensions for Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke and Te P캐ti M캐ori co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. The M캐ori Party criticized the recommendations as a "warning shot to all of us to fall in line," while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters condemned the trio's actions. The proposed suspensions will be put to a vote, amidst controversy over the Treaty Principles Bill that prompted the protest.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes it will be shielded from potential U.S. tariffs. Most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders, as Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system. The IMF noted that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, but heightened trade tensions and trade policy uncertainty pose risks. The fund singled out Novo Nordisk's increased demand for Wegovy and Ozempic as a key driver of growth.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts delivered a crucial two-run double after the Athletics intentionally walked Shohei Ohtani, leading the Dodgers to a 9-3 victory. This was the fifth time since Betts and Ohtani switched lineup spots that a team intentionally walked Ohtani to face Betts. Betts expressed his frustration with the strategy, using the moment to fuel his performance.
