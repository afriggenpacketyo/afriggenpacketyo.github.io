          <p>The UK is set to permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new laws. This decision follows a previous ban enacted after a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, which was backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes aim to protect media plurality while helping publishers secure necessary funding. The new regulations set the threshold for State Owned Investors at 15% of shares or voting rights, deemed the most effective and proportionate approach.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills designed to streamline housing development in urban areas by cutting red tape and reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Newsom's revised budget proposal includes provisions to expedite new housing projects, including permit deadlines for the Coastal Commission and CEQA streamlining for projects over $100 million. The governor emphasized the urgency of addressing the housing crisis and the need to accelerate urban infill development. Assembly Bill 609 and Senate Bill 607 aim to ease the permitting process and clarify CEQA exemptions for urban infill housing projects.</p>

          <p>The Santa Monica City Council has approved a motion to transform Third Street Promenade into an entertainment zone by allowing visitors to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages outdoors. This initiative aims to help businesses recover from the pandemic by increasing foot traffic to the commercial district. The new policy will be in effect from June, every Friday through Sunday, from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Participants must be 21 or older, wear a wristband, and purchase alcoholic drinks from licensed businesses. The proposal has faced mixed reactions, with some residents expressing concerns about potential increases in crime and homelessness.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that overdose deaths in the United States have fallen significantly, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The CDC praised President Trump's efforts in addressing the issue, but the article also notes that these improvements are threatened by proposed cuts to federal health programs. Experts express concern that these cuts could reverse the progress made in reducing drug-related fatalities. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, emphasizing the need for sustained public health interventions and funding to address the complex nature of addiction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits in 2026, due to a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies. Those already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not be kicked off their plans, but starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom's office estimates the changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how the resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez brought the culture and politics of the 1990s under scrutiny. The brothers' lawyer argued that the era's criminal justice policies, such as three-strikes laws and punitive long sentences, should be reconsidered in light of today's mores. The article highlights how the brothers' case was influenced by the media landscape and public perception of the time. The rise of true-crime programming and social media campaigns have contributed to renewed interest in the case and a more sympathetic view of the brothers' circumstances.</p>
