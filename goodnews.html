          <p>Bulgaria has received the green light from the European Commission and the European Central Bank to join the Eurozone, potentially becoming the 21st member state to adopt the single currency. The assessment indicates that Bulgaria meets the necessary requirements, paving the way for euro adoption starting January 1, 2026. This marks a significant shift from previous reports that cited high inflation as an obstacle. While there are mixed attitudes within Bulgaria regarding euro adoption, the country's Prime Minister is supportive of the move, which is expected to bring more investment, trade, and stability to the Bulgarian economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure across England, benefiting mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with Greater Manchester and the West Midlands receiving significant allocations for tram network extensions. This move marks a departure from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The transport investment aims to address regional disparities and promote growth in underserved areas. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced that changes to the winter fuel payment will be implemented this year, expanding eligibility to more people. This marks a U-turn on the government's previous policy, which limited the payment to those on pension credit. The decision follows criticism of Labour's poor performance in recent local elections, attributed to the reduction in pensioners receiving the allowance. While details remain unclear, Reeves stated that the means test will increase, ensuring more people receive the winter fuel payment this winter.</p>

          <h2>On-Time Debt Payments Aren't Always Enough to Boost Credit Score</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While making on-time debt payments is crucial for credit scores, it's not the only factor, according to experts. Not all debt payments are reported to credit bureaus, meaning that payments for rent-to-own, private school tuition, or utilities may not impact your score. Additionally, some buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not be reported unless payments are missed. To understand which payments are influencing your credit, review your credit report regularly.
