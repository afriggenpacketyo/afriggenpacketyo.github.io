          <p>The Trump administration unveiled a multibillion-dollar plan to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, aiming to replace outdated technology with modern systems within four years. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted the urgency of the plan, spurred by recent airport disruptions and safety concerns, including a midair collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The proposal includes upgrading telecommunications, radio, and surveillance systems, investing in new ground radar sensors, and constructing new air traffic control towers. The plan requires congressional approval and funding, with President Trump endorsing the initiative and airline executives expressing support.</p>
