          <p>Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings revealed strong sales growth of 69%, driven by demand for its data center GPUs used in artificial intelligence, however, US export controls restricting sales of its H20 chip are hindering growth in the Chinese market, which Nvidia estimates to be a $50 billion opportunity. The company expects to sell $45 billion in chips during the July quarter, but missed out on $2.5 billion in sales during the April quarter due to these restrictions. Cloud providers, including Microsoft and Google, remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is also focusing on AI inference, where its GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers, driven by surging demand for reasoning AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering strong returns, surpassing the current inflation rate and providing a safe investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. The national average for a 1-year CD is 2.01% APY, while top-performing online banks offer rates up to 4.40% APY for 6-month and 1-year terms. An inverted yield curve has led to short-term CDs offering higher rates than longer-term options, and investors can consider laddering CDs to take advantage of these high rates while saving for the long term. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage and refinance interest rates remain high, but opportunities exist for new homebuyers and current homeowners to secure favorable rates. As of May 29, 2025, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage is 6.95%, and the average rate for a 15-year mortgage is 6.14%. Strengthening your credit profile by paying bills on time and comparing different lenders can improve your chances of qualifying for a better rate. Short-term loans generally offer better interest rates than longer terms, and locking in your mortgage rate after approval can protect against potential increases. (not investment advice)</p>

However, concerns remain about local objections and the time it will take to complete the projects, which are not expected to be finished until 2036 and 2040.
