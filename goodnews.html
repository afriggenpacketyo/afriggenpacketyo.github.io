          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula prompted extensive tsunami alerts for countries across the Pacific, including the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii, and Japan. While the quake's strength caused initial alarm and some evacuations, the resulting waves were smaller than feared in most areas, leading to minor flooding but no major damage or casualties outside of Russia. Most warnings were downgraded to advisories or canceled within hours, as officials confirmed the most significant danger had passed. The event served as a major test for regional tsunami warning systems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, a significant turnaround from the 0.5% contraction in the first three months of the year. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which statistically boosts GDP. However, economists caution that the headline figure may overstate the economy's underlying strength, as a key measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since 2022.

In exchange, the Phillies are said to be sending top prospects, including right-handed pitcher Mick Abel, to the Twins. Duran, known for his triple-digit fastball, is expected to substantially bolster Philadelphia's bullpen as the team aims for a World Series run. The deal is also notable as Duran is under team control through the 2028 season.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Why Massive Russian Quake Caused Limited Tsunami Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in minimal tsunami damage for most of the Pacific Rim. Scientists explain that the quake's energy was primarily directed into a vast, open stretch of the Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with the presence of deep-ocean sensors that provided rapid warnings, meant that a potential catastrophe was largely averted, representing a best-case scenario for a distant tsunami event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary piece from CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzes the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, attributing the central bank's reluctance to a highly mixed economic environment. On one hand, a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth argue against a rate cut. On the other, stubbornly high housing costs and signs of weakening consumer spending in some sectors create a case for easing. This uncertainty, compounded by the unknown effects of tariffs, has left the Fed in a difficult position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that audience appetites are shifting away from pure escapism towards more stressful, hyperrealistic television. It points to the success of anxiety-inducing shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which use techniques like real-time pacing and intimate close-ups to immerse viewers in high-pressure environments. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be satisfying and cathartic, allowing audiences to process their own real-world anxieties by relating to the struggles of hardworking, sincere characters on screen.</p>
