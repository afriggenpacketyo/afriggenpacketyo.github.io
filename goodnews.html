          <p>An Ohio couple has given birth to a baby boy from an embryo that was frozen for nearly 31 years, believed to be the longest storage time to result in a live birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, involved an embryo donated in 1994 by a woman who could not use it herself. This event highlights the growing practice of donating unused embryos from IVF treatments, a topic that has gained attention amid debates over the legal status of frozen embryos. The birth sets a new record, surpassing a previous one involving a 30-year-old embryo.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Co. is reportedly set to announce a deal giving the National Football League an ownership stake in its sports media giant, ESPN. In exchange for the equity, ESPN is expected to take over operations of the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This partnership has been in discussion for over 18 months as ESPN adapts to the decline of traditional pay TV subscriptions. The deal would give the NFL a financial interest in one of its major broadcast partners, potentially influencing future media rights negotiations.</p>

The administration cited declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among youth as a threat to national vitality. The original test was criticized for its competitive nature and potential negative impact on students' mental health. Experts are cautiously optimistic, hoping a revamped version will focus on promoting lifelong health habits rather than just athletic performance.</p>

The partnership aims to address the military's growing interest in cheaper, more flexible, and autonomous aviation technologies for applications like surveillance and logistics.

Despite the city's tumultuous history of industrial boom and bust, the studio has survived by creating unique tiles and vessels known for their distinctive, iridescent glazes. The company still uses much of its original equipment and hand-presses its tiles. Now operating as a nonprofit, Pewabic has seen renewed interest and record sales, proving the enduring appeal of craftsmanship in a modern age.</p>

          <h2>Examining Reverse Mortgage Borrowing Potential for Homeowners at Age 70</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 14:49:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners aged 70, a reverse mortgage can be a compelling option to tap into home equity for retirement income, especially with recent changes in the market. The Federal Housing Administration has increased the maximum claim amount for these loans in 2025, and borrowers at this age qualify for higher payout ratios than younger retirees. For example, a 70-year-old with a $500,000 home could potentially access a gross principal limit of around $205,000. The article advises that choosing the right payout option and comparing lender fees are key strategies to maximize benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
