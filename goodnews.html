          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of books to train its AI model Claude constitutes "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that the large language models (LLMs) did not reproduce the creative elements or identifiable expressive style of the copyrighted works. The ruling is a significant victory for AI companies amidst ongoing legal battles over the use of copyrighted material in AI development. This decision begins to define the legal boundaries for the AI industry regarding the use of copyrighted works for training purposes.</p>
