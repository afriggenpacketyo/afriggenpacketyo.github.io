          <p>A party yacht struck a dock in the Hudson River, resulting in injuries to dozens of passengers. The 200-foot yacht, "Timeless," hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, leading to 35 people sustaining non-life-threatening injuries, with 22 hospitalized. Passengers described being knocked off their feet during the incident, which occurred during a 69th birthday party with nearly 400 people on board. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which follows a similar accident a month prior involving a Mexican navy ship and the Brooklyn Bridge. The tone of the article reflects the relief that no one died, despite the injuries sustained.</p>
