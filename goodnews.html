          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive procedure, which avoids open-skull surgery typical of methods like Elon Musk's Neuralink, was performed on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient. The new technique reportedly reduces surgical risks and recovery time, allowing the patient to regain some limb movement by controlling external devices with their brain. The stent electrode was inserted via a neck vein into the brain's vascular network, marking a significant potential advancement in neurotechnology and patient care.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball despite a performance their manager described as not their best. Shohei Ohtani started the scoring with a leadoff home run and later hit a game-tying triple, while Max Muncy also contributed a two-run homer. The bullpen managed to hold the lead, closing the game with a bases-loaded double play in the ninth inning. While the team has been winning consistently, manager Dave Roberts believes they have yet to play a complete stretch of their best baseball.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated that the club has no intention of selling 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and that the best plan for his development is to remain with the team. The academy product, who signed a new five-year contract last year, had a breakthrough season and is considered a key part of the club's long-term plans, with a loan being the only possibility if all parties agree it's beneficial.</p>

The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring follows the expiration of their lease agreement with the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. A farewell ceremony drew around 3,000 visitors to the park. The Wakayama zoo has had a successful joint breeding program since 1994, raising 17 cubs, but this move marks a potential turning point in China's "panda diplomacy."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates that a traditional Japanese-style diet is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, analyzed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While 30.9% of the total cohort showed depressive symptoms, those who adhered to a Japanese diet were less likely to do so. Researchers suggest that nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables could contribute to improved mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer has introduced a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich in the UK, drawing inspiration from the viral Japanese "fruit sando." The sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, became the supermarket's top-selling sandwich in the two days following its launch. While fruit sandwiches are a popular snack in Japan, often found in convenience stores and bakeries, this marks one of the first times they have been widely available on British supermarket shelves. The launch has sparked a conversation about the definition of a sandwich and unusual culinary combinations.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring real-life sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and dysfunctional relationships, often addressing taboo subjects like mental health and abortion with dark humor. Sadler says the new series is influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene and a trend of intentional singlehood seen on social media. The comedy satirizes this by making being single the characters' "worst nightmare," promising a season that is both more depressing and funnier.</p>

Phages are viruses that specifically prey on and kill bacteria, offering a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics. A project at the University of Southampton is collecting phage samples from the public, even from household toilets, to build a library of these viruses to test against dangerous infections. While the science is still developing and faces regulatory hurdles, it represents a promising frontier in the fight against the "silent pandemic" of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old senior at Waunakee High School in Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent hundreds of hours in her garage painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she used to know in elementary and middle school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had paid more attention to her.

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing an elite law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that the order, which sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances, "is unconstitutional from beginning to end." This marks the fourth consecutive legal defeat for the administration's campaign against law firms that have represented clients or causes opposed by the president. The rulings have consistently found the orders to be an unconstitutional attack on the firms' rights and the legal system itself.</p>
