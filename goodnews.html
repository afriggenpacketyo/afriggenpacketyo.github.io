          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. He emphasized that the deal involves investment and partial ownership but ensures U.S. control, referencing a potential partnership that could create 70,000 jobs and provide a $14 billion boost to the economy. Trump's approval follows a review by federal agencies, though details of the acquisition scheme remain undisclosed. Both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have welcomed the president's decision, but Trump has not revealed any details of the potential acquisition scheme. </p>

          <h2>Tripadvisor Reports Increase in Fake Reviews in 2024, Enhances Detection Methods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, a rise from previous years, attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improved detection systems. The company defines a fake review as biased or non-firsthand content intended to manipulate a property's reputation. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews, with boosting and member fraud accounting for the majority of these submissions. The article highlights the ongoing "cat and mouse" game between Tripadvisor and those attempting to post fake reviews, as the company continues to refine its detection methods.</p>
