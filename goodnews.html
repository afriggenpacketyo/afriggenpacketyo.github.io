          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 12:24:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance deals. The regulator estimates that the average payout could be around £700 per person, with a total compensation bill for lenders potentially reaching £8.2 billion. The issue stems from discretionary commission arrangements where dealers were incentivized to charge higher interest rates. This scheme covers 14 million motor finance agreements made between April 2007 and November 2024, aiming to provide fair compensation for customers who were overcharged or given inaccurate information.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising consumer debt and default rates, it is crucial for borrowers to understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). This federal law provides significant protections, including the right to be treated fairly and without harassment, prohibiting abusive language or threats from collectors. Borrowers also have the right to demand and dispute information, requiring collectors to provide proof of the debt before continuing collection efforts. Furthermore, consumers can control how and when they are contacted, and can even demand that communication cease entirely, offering them space to manage their financial situation without undue pressure.</p>

          <p>Jibaritos y Más, a family-owned restaurant in Chicago's Humboldt Park, is celebrated not only for its authentic Puerto Rican cuisine but also for its deep commitment to community service. Founded by Venezuelan immigrant Yelitza Rivera and her son Jesus Arrieta, the restaurant prepares and donates 80 to 100 fresh, hot meals every day to neighbors in need. This initiative, born from Rivera's desire to give back, provides a critical lifeline for many in the community. The restaurant's signature dish is the jibarito, a Chicago-born sandwich that uses flattened plantains instead of bread, symbolizing a blend of cultures that defines their mission.</p>

          <p>English football club Arsenal is holding internal discussions about redeveloping its Emirates Stadium to increase its current capacity of 60,704. While the talks are in the preliminary stages with no concrete plans yet, the club is considering options to add thousands of seats to keep pace with other top English clubs. The discussions have even touched upon the possibility of temporarily playing home matches at Wembley Stadium if major construction work is required. The Emirates Stadium, which will mark its 20th anniversary next year, is currently the fifth-largest club stadium in England, behind grounds like Manchester United's Old Trafford.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychology and finance author Morgan Housel, true happiness is derived from contentment rather than the endless pursuit of wealth. He posits that happiness is simply the gap between one's expectations and their circumstances, meaning a person with little who wants nothing more can feel richer than a billionaire who always desires more. The article outlines five rules for achieving this state of psychological wealth, including appreciating the beauty in ordinary life and managing expectations. Ultimately, the key is to reach a point of satisfaction with what one has, regardless of income or lifestyle, to realize that happiness is a state where nothing feels missing.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised technology, but the minor update was overshadowed by widespread investor speculation about a more significant product announcement. The company had released cryptic teaser clips hinting at a reveal on October 7, fueling expectations for its lower-cost Model Y, the long-promised next-generation Roadster, or another new venture. Tesla's auto sales have been in a slump due to an aging lineup and increased competition, prompting the company to pivot its focus toward its future as a robotics and self-driving technology business. The anticipation caused Tesla shares to climb 5% ahead of the expected reveal.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is purchasing additional shares of GE Vernova, expressing strong conviction in the power equipment maker's long-term prospects. The move is based on the increasing demand for energy infrastructure needed to support the expansion of artificial intelligence data centers, which require massive amounts of power. The club views GE Vernova, which produces gas turbines and grid solutions, as a key beneficiary of this trend. While acknowledging softness in the company's onshore wind business, the analysis suggests this weakness is already priced into the stock and is outweighed by the significant growth potential in its other segments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis suggests that Ukraine may be turning the tables on Russia by effectively compensating for its own manpower shortage through superior technology and tactical innovation. Ukrainian commanders are increasingly relying on sophisticated drone operations for surveillance and strikes, allowing them to inflict losses on Russian forces while minimizing direct contact and casualties for their own troops. The strategy also involves more careful use of artillery, precise troop movements, and better rotation plans to conserve their limited number of soldiers. This adaptation for a long war of attrition may be shifting the conflict's momentum in Ukraine's favor.</p>
