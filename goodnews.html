          <p>Taylor Swift made her podcast debut on "New Heights," hosted by Travis and Jason Kelce, to announce her 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl," set for release on October 3rd. She revealed the album was written during the European leg of her Eras Tour and described it as an upbeat pop record, a significant departure from her previous work. During the widely-viewed episode, Swift also discussed her relationship with Travis Kelce, her process for creating fan "easter eggs," and the emotional experience of reacquiring the rights to her master recordings. The appearance provided a rare, in-depth interview from the typically private superstar.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 20:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Photos of rabbits with black, horn-like growths circulating online have prompted concern, but Colorado wildlife officials have a scientific explanation. The animals are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively common and typically harmless disease spread by fleas, ticks, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact. The growths, or papillomas, are usually not harmful unless they interfere with the rabbit's ability to eat, and they disappear once the animal's immune system fights off the virus. The disease, which cannot spread to humans or other pets, is believed to be the origin of the mythical "jackalope" creature.</p>

          <p>Following their $8 billion takeover, David Ellison and his team at Skydance Media have laid out their vision for revitalizing Paramount. The new leadership plans to nearly double the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies, focusing on major intellectual property like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Transformers," with "Top Gun 3" being a top priority. Ellison emphasized a goal of making the studio the premier destination for top talent and creating entertainment for a broad, depoliticized audience. The strategy also includes significant investments in content, such as a $7.7 billion deal for UFC streaming rights.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure trips, is a widespread practice, with 55% of business travelers admitting they've had loved ones join them. The trend is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% having been accompanied by partners, children, or friends. Motivations include saving on vacation costs and reclaiming personal time that would otherwise be lost to work travel. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often don't broadcast these arrangements, citing concerns about appearing unprofessional or navigating policy "grey zones" regarding expenses and liability.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, a major step toward liquidating the company to pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. The receiver now has the authority to seize property, control websites, and sell the company's assets, including the Infowars brand itself. This move shifts the process out of federal bankruptcy court, where it had been stalled for years, and could lead to the first significant payouts for the families. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction that this will finally bring accountability for Alex Jones's harassment campaigns.</p>

          <p>Igor Babuschkin, a founding member of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI, has announced his departure to start his own venture firm. Babuschkin Ventures will focus on supporting AI safety research and investing in AI startups. In his announcement, Babuschkin reflected on helping build xAI and its "blistering velocity" in developing frontier models, while Musk thanked him for his contributions. The departure comes as xAI has faced scrutiny over safety issues, including its Grok chatbot generating and spreading false and antisemitic content on multiple occasions.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study from Sweden suggests that medication for ADHD can provide wider life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the BMJ, found that starting drug treatment was linked to significant reductions in first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. Researchers believe this is because the medication helps reduce impulsivity and improves concentration, which are key factors in these negative outcomes. The findings could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about treatment by highlighting the potential risks of unmedicated ADHD.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs aimed at curbing China's dominance in shipbuilding, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines. This strategic shift is seen as a way for Korean shipbuilders to overcome domestic constraints such as high labor costs and limited capacity, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. For example, HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to ten vessels annually. Analysts note this could be a viable long-term solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain in a penalty shootout after conceding two late goals to squander a 2-0 lead. Despite the heartbreaking collapse, the performance showed promising signs of new manager Thomas Frank's influence, particularly with a well-organized 3-5-2 formation and success from set-pieces. For 85 minutes, Spurs effectively contained the European champions with a pragmatic and efficient approach, a notable shift from the previous season's style. While the late wilt under pressure highlights areas for improvement, the overall display suggests a solid foundation for Frank to build upon.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that as trust in traditional institutions declines, independent, evidence-based creators on social media are becoming vital sources of credible information. These creators—journalists and specialists—work to debunk misinformation and provide context, but they struggle to compete in an attention economy that rewards virality over veracity. The article proposes creating new infrastructure to support them, such as an independent certification system to signal trustworthiness and shared-ownership models for resources like legal protection. It calls on legacy media to partner with, rather than compete against, these new voices.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Brinker International, which owns Chili's, credits a significant increase in marketing spend and effective value offerings for the restaurant chain's recent success. Same-store sales at Chili's grew by 23.7%, and the company raised its full-year forecast. The CEO noted that the marketing budget quadrupled to $137 million, fueling successful campaigns that include social media influencers and a standardized $10.99 value meal. This growth strategy is helping the company combat inflationary pressures on labor and goods by creating leverage on fixed costs and driving higher margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marc Maron, host of the long-running "WTF" podcast which he recently announced is ending, has criticized the current state of podcasting. In a new interview, he described the landscape as a sea of "mediocre afternoon drive-time radio," filled with hundreds of similar shows lacking originality. Maron, who started his influential interview podcast in 2009, expressed that the uniqueness of the medium has been diluted now that "everyone has a voice." This critique follows his recent announcement that "WTF" will conclude its 15-year run sometime in the fall.</p>
