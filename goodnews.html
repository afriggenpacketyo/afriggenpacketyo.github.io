          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to a new record, trading above $120,000 amid strong institutional investment and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation. The rally is fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, with analysts suggesting that long-term institutional buyers are driving the momentum. U.S. lawmakers are currently deliberating a series of bills, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' aimed at establishing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. This potential for increased regulatory clarity has bolstered investor confidence and is supported by the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting a potential shift to a mutual ownership model run by its postmasters. This proposal follows the major scandal involving the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters due to faulty Horizon software. The government aims to rebuild trust and transform the organization's culture, while also exploring what future services, particularly banking, the Post Office should offer. Ministers have indicated the current network size of 11,500 branches is broadly correct and do not foresee closures.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) are presented as a method to protect savings from inflation, with top accounts currently offering rates that exceed the inflation rate. The article notes a significant difference between national average CD yields and the higher rates available, particularly from online banks which have lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs presently offer better rates than long-term ones. Strategies like laddering CDs are suggested to take advantage of the current rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

It acknowledges the challenging market for homebuyers due to high rates but suggests that securing a good rate is still possible, especially for those with strong credit profiles. The report highlights that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rates, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit scores and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are debating the value of implementing 'brain training' programs in schools to improve children's cognitive skills like memory and attention, which some research suggests have declined post-pandemic. A recent German study indicated that a 12-hour working memory program improved students' focus, IQ, and long-term academic outcomes. However, other researchers caution against drawing broad conclusions from a single study, pointing to large-scale reviews that show such programs often have limited or no effect when tested in real classroom settings. Critics worry that these programs could displace essential curriculum time for subjects like reading.</p>
