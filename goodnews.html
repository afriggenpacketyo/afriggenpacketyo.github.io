          <p>The biggest talking point from the 107th US PGA, aside from Scottie Scheffler's victory, was the controversy surrounding Rory McIlroy's "non-conforming" driver. Rumors emerged that McIlroy had been forced to switch drivers after his original club failed a test of legality. The PGA of America confirmed that testing had been carried out by the USGA, but no names were released. McIlroy uncharacteristically ignored reporters, adding to the speculation surrounding the validity of his Masters win.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland halted hard-right breakthroughs, but discontent with mainstream parties remains. In Romania, a centrist mayor defeated a hard-line nationalist aligned with Trump. In Poland, the liberal mayor of Warsaw secured a spot in a runoff against a nationalist historian. The big shock in Poland was the strong showing of far-right candidates, signaling a shift away from the duopoly of Civic Platform and Law and Justice. The outcome of the runoff will depend on which candidate far-right voters decide to support.</p>
