          <p>In her new album, "Man's Best Friend," pop star Sabrina Carpenter explores the theme of attracting unimpressive men despite achieving superstardom. Following the massive success of her previous album, "Short n' Sweet," this new work finds her humorously lamenting a dating pool filled with incompetent and emotionally unavailable partners. The album's sound, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff, blends '70s-era pop influences with modern country and dance music.

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, following their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" for not apologizing for a net cord, a remark that drew criticism. In a social media post, Ostapenko clarified that she was referring to tennis etiquette and that English is not her first language, but acknowledged her words could have been offensive. Townsend had stated she did not believe the comments were racially motivated, though the incident sparked debate within the tennis community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reported that he personally solved a whodunit at the White House involving a large gash in the newly installed limestone in the Rose Garden. In a social media post, Trump explained his anger upon discovering the damage and how he used security footage to identify the culprits. He determined that a subcontractor's broken steel cart had scraped against the stone, causing the 25-yard-long mark. The president stated that the contractor would be charged for the replacement of the stone and would be barred from future work at the White House, emphasizing that surfaces are very important to him as a builder.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has revoked permission for striker Nicolas Jackson to complete a loan move to Bayern Munich, instructing him to return to London from Germany where he was set for a medical. The dramatic reversal came after fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap sustained a serious hamstring injury during a match against Fulham, leaving the team with only one fit senior striker. The decision has reportedly angered the 24-year-old Jackson, whose initial £13 million loan deal collapsed within 24 hours of being agreed upon. Bayern Munich's sporting director confirmed Chelsea's decision, leaving the forward's immediate future uncertain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing consolidated advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that limits should be tied to developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three, as they need to explore the physical world and develop self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is suggested to ensure time for imaginative play and social interaction. As children grow older, guidelines expand to about one to two hours for teenagers, but experts stress that content quality and parental engagement are more crucial than strict time limits, warning against allowing consumption to become a secretive habit.</p>

The 79-year-old was photographed with his grandchildren at the White House before heading to his golf course, effectively quelling the viral speculation. The online rumors were fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a tragedy were to occur, which sparked concern over the president's health. The White House has previously addressed health concerns, attributing bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking and a benign circulatory condition.</p>

          <p>New York City's health department has officially declared an end to the Legionnaire's disease outbreak in central Harlem, which resulted in seven deaths and 114 confirmed cases. The declaration comes after three weeks have passed without any new cases being identified among residents or workers in the affected area. An investigation traced the legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, the mayor's administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and proactive testing of cooling tower systems to prevent future outbreaks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. Researchers in the UK used a device that records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds with an AI trained on data from thousands of patients, picking up subtleties the human ear cannot. In a trial involving over 200 GP surgeries, the AI stethoscope significantly improved the detection rates for all three conditions compared to standard methods. Experts are calling the technology a potential "game-changer" that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, updates the 1984 Troma cult classic with a higher production value and a well-known cast including Peter Dinklage and Kevin Bacon. Dinklage plays a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, transforms into a disfigured vigilante fighting a corrupt corporation. While the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of the original, its polished filmmaking and sincere emotional core create a different experience from the cheap, offensive charm of its predecessor. The result is a diverting and goofy-yet-violent superhero satire that pays homage to the Troma style while being accessible to a broader audience.</p>
