        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume decreased by 3.9% last week, despite a slight decrease in interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($806,500 or less) fell to 6.92% from 6.98%. Refinance applications also dropped by 4%, though they remain 42% higher than a year ago, while applications for home purchases decreased by 4% but are 18% higher than last year due to increased market supply. The next major market movement may occur with the release of the monthly employment report. Optimism is tempered as rates have remained relatively stable for two months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bulgaria has secured the green light to join the Eurozone, potentially becoming the 21st member state to adopt the single currency, with the European Central Bank reporting that the country meets the necessary requirements. The ECB's assessment marks a shift from the previous year, when Bulgaria's inflation rate was deemed too high, as the country's harmonized consumer price index came in at 2.8% in April. While there are mixed attitudes within Bulgaria regarding Eurozone membership, Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov supports the move. This development signifies a step forward in European economic integration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against former Atlanta police officer Sung Kim in the 2019 death of Jimmy Atchison, citing self-defense. Judge Michael Brown ruled that Kim's actions during the arrest operation were "textbook self-defense," noting that Atchison made a sudden movement towards Kim. Kim, a member of the FBI Atlanta Violent Crime Task Force, was indicted in 2022 on charges including involuntary manslaughter and felony murder. The ruling was based on Supremacy Clause immunity and self-defense immunity, with Kim's attorney criticizing the Fulton County DA's office for an "inexcusable abuse of prosecutorial discretion."</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that changes to winter fuel payments will be implemented this year to allow more people to receive the allowance, reversing a previous policy that restricted payments to those on pension credit. The initial decision to means-test the payment was criticized for impacting pensioners with slightly higher incomes who still struggle with energy costs. While details on the changes remain unclear, the government aims to address concerns and provide clarity by the autumn Budget. The government insists the original policy was necessary to stabilize public finances, but economic improvements now allow for a partial reversal.</p>

          <p>The McDonald's Snack Wrap is making a comeback to U.S. menus on July 10 after being discontinued in 2016 due to kitchen preparation complexities. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a departure from the original version's grilled chicken option. The company has launched a promotional webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, showcasing fan appreciation and petitions for its return. The return of the Snack Wrap, which involved a "years-long process," is attributed to persistent customer demand and social media campaigns.</p>

          <p>The German government plans to simplify the process of designating countries as safe origins to reduce the number of asylum seekers. The move, agreed upon by Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government, would eliminate the need for approval from Germany's upper house of parliament when determining if persecution in a country justifies granting asylum. This aims to expedite asylum decisions and address concerns about migration, which has contributed to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. The cabinet also agreed to abolish mandatory legal counsel for asylum seekers facing expulsion.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has implemented one of the most successful public, universal pre-K programs in the US, offering free pre-kindergarten to all 4-year-olds regardless of income. The program's success is attributed to a combination of factors, including a legislative loophole and strategic implementation that avoided disrupting private child care providers. The state's experience demonstrates the potential for universal pre-K to benefit children and working families, with careful planning needed to sustain the private child care industry. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's approach by focusing on how to implement universal pre-K while addressing the needs of the child care sector.</p>
