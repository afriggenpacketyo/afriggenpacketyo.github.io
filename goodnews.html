          <p>Hollywood Forever Cemetery has unveiled a new five-story mausoleum to address the high demand for burial space in Los Angeles. The Gower Mausoleum provides crypts for approximately 13,000 people, offering a vertical solution to land scarcity in the city. The structure is designed with marble, natural light, and views of L.A. landmarks, aiming to provide a peaceful resting place for the deceased and a comforting space for visitors. The cemetery, known for hosting community events like movie nights and yoga, continues to innovate in death care services, with two floors of the new mausoleum already sold out.</p>

          <p>A group of students preparing for their GCSE exams have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters, written just after a major COVID-19 lockdown, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from personal goals to whether face masks would still be needed. The exercise provides a poignant look at how the pandemic shaped the secondary school experience for this cohort, who faced remote learning and 'bubble' restrictions. The students reflected on their personal growth and resilience over the past four years, with many still holding onto the ambitions they documented.</p>

          <p>20-year-old British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma secured a decisive victory over veteran Dillian Whyte with a first-round stoppage in London. Itauma sent Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hook, and the referee stopped the fight just 119 seconds into the bout after Whyte struggled to his feet. The win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0, with 11 of those victories coming by knockout. This performance further solidifies his position as a rising star in the heavyweight division and a potential future title contender, demonstrating composure and power well beyond his years in his first headline fight.</p>

          <p>Nine prison guards in Guatemala City who were held hostage by rioting inmates have been freed after a three-day ordeal. The riots began earlier in the week in two separate prisons, led by members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs. The inmates were demanding the return of ten gang leaders who had been transferred to another facility and placed in solitary confinement. The situation had escalated, with one prison official being shot and killed on Friday during the unrest. This incident follows a similar hostage situation earlier in the week where eleven other guards were freed by anti-kidnapping teams.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, moving beyond stereotypical dishes like chow mein to introduce diverse, authentic regional cuisines. Brands specializing in fiery Hunan stir-fries, Chongqing grilled fish, and Xinjiang lamb skewers are using cities like Singapore as a launchpad for global growth. This culinary wave is driven by intense competition in China's domestic market and aims to correct outdated Western perceptions of Chinese food as low-brow or monolithic. These establishments focus on authentic flavors and cultural experiences, reflecting a form of soft power that may help improve China's international image through its rich gastronomic heritage.</p>

          <p>A new music collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" chronicles the final creative period of Elvis Presley's career, featuring recordings made in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This era produced his last major pop hit, "Burning Love," and saw him evolve into an expressive ballad singer, though it also marked a time of personal and professional disappointment, notably his failed bid to star in "A Star Is Born." The box set includes studio tracks and extensive rehearsal tapes for his Las Vegas shows, offering insight into his musical process. It captures a period when the rock and roll pioneer was grappling with his place in a musical landscape he had helped create.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market increased from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to data from Canalys. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's gains reflect its strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points. Analysts predict Apple may release its own foldable phone by 2026 to compete in this emerging segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City began their Premier League season with a dominant 4-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers, led by a standout performance from new midfielder Tijjani Reijnders. The Dutch international scored one goal and provided an assist on his debut, demonstrating the box-to-box energy City's midfield lacked at times last season. Manager Pep Guardiola praised the 27-year-old as a "top signing" who made an immediate impact with his pace and intelligent runs. Reijnders' all-action display suggests he will be a key player for the club as they look to rebound from a disappointing previous campaign.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has sent a letter to the government, urging the immediate evacuation of sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. The letter highlights the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and describes the humanitarian situation as a catastrophe of "horrific proportion." The MPs are calling for a clear timeline for evacuations, adequate funding, and for the process to be based solely on clinical need. They also request that the children and their families be given the option to claim asylum or resettle in the UK after treatment is complete.</p>
