          <p>China has officially opened its international operations center for the digital yuan in Shanghai, signaling a significant push to encourage its use in cross-border payments and overseas markets. The People's Bank of China unveiled three platforms designed to accelerate the digital currency's internationalization, aiming to reshape the global financial architecture currently dominated by the US dollar. Central bank deputy governor Lu Lei emphasized the historical inevitability of evolving monetary and payment systems in the digital era. This initiative seeks to provide open, inclusive, and innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency of international transactions and expand existing financial infrastructure onto the blockchain.

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks secured their eighth consecutive victory over the Arizona Cardinals, winning 23-20 on a dramatic 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. Quarterback Sam Darnold delivered an efficient performance, throwing for 242 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks initially squandered a 14-point fourth-quarter lead, allowing Kyler Murray to lead a Cardinals rally with two late touchdown passes. However, a crucial penalty on the ensuing kickoff provided Seattle with favorable field position, enabling Myers to calmly convert the game-winning kick and seal the thrilling Thursday night football match.</p>

This article explains that a super cycle signifies a prolonged period of persistent market growth. Ganguly highlights the resurgence of Silicon Valley's influence, the empowerment of sole founders through AI, and a significant shift towards "deep" tech over consumer-facing companies in the coming decade. While acknowledging a potential "bubble" in AI valuation, he identifies India as a key market for AI-native apps and fundamental innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

This engineering marvel rises an astonishing 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below to its bridge deck, a height comparable to mainland China’s tallest skyscraper, the Shanghai Tower. The article notes it surpasses the previous record holder, the Duge Bridge, also located in Guizhou. In crossing the Huajiang Grand Canyon, the bridge is also poised to become the longest mountain bridge globally, with a total length of 2,890 meters, showcasing China's advanced infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump declared he would not allow Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, stating, "It's not going to happen," ahead of a meeting with the Israeli prime minister. This article reports Trump's comments, also noting progress on a "Gaza deal." The statement comes amidst increasing global pressure on Israel to end the Gaza war and West Bank occupation, with a wave of Western states formally recognizing an independent Palestinian state. Trump's stance contrasts with ultranationalists in Netanyahu's coalition who strongly advocate for annexation, signaling a potential shift in US policy.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576 aims to prevent streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials at excessively loud volumes, a problem notably highlighted by an 8-month-old baby being woken up. This article explains that while federal law already regulates TV ad volume, streaming services are currently exempt. Due to California's significant market influence, the bill, if signed by Governor Newsom, could effectively set a national standard for ad volume control. The legislation, which passed the state Senate unanimously, faces opposition from the Motion Picture Association, citing practical difficulties for streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. This article highlights that the coral, protected under endangered species acts, was in poor health after five days in transit. Aquarium experts describe their facility as a "coral hospital," where many pieces have since recovered sufficiently for public display. The initiative serves to educate the public about the illegal wildlife trade and the critical importance of conservation for these "ambassadors for their species" in the wild.</p>

This article reports that the Marin Humane confirmed at least two ER cases, with one 80-year-old victim recounting a sudden attack on her leg. Flyers have been posted warning residents of the "very mean squirrel" in the Lucas Valley neighborhood. Experts suggest such rare aggressive behavior often stems from humans hand-feeding wildlife, causing animals to lose their natural fear and become aggressive when not fed. Preventative measures emphasize avoiding feeding wild animals.</p>
