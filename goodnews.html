          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest officially began in Munich, Germany, with the traditional tapping of the first beer keg by Mayor Dieter Reiter. He marked the opening with the customary Bavarian phrase "O'zapft is!" ("It is tapped!") before handing the first mug to Bavarian Premier Markus Söder. The world's largest beer and folk festival is expected to attract over six million visitors to the Theresienwiese fairground from September 20 to October 5. Despite record-high beer prices this year, the event anticipates continuing its tradition of massive attendance, following a record 7.2 million visitors in 2023 who consumed 7.4 million liters of beer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like hairy caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are a significant part of the local cuisine and economy. Valued for their high protein content and organic nature, these insects are harvested from forests and sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa. While caterpillars are an expensive delicacy, the more common maggots provide an affordable nutritional alternative to meat for many in a country where two-thirds of the population lives on under $2 a day. Organizations like Farms for Orphans are now commercially raising the larvae to supply orphanages and meet growing demand, promoting insect consumption as a solution to food insecurity.</p>

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including British 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, have raised concerns about the logistical arrangements for warm-up facilities. The main warm-up area in Yoyogi Park is a 15-minute, two-and-a-half-kilometer bus journey from the competition stadium, which athletes describe as draining and unusual. World Athletics president Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is "not perfect," explaining that the track used during the Olympics was no longer available. Organizers stated they have done everything possible to manage the transport challenges, noting that such configurations are not unique to this event and that athlete performances remain strong.</p>

          <p>In a major drug bust, South African police have dismantled a sophisticated crystal methamphetamine laboratory on a farm in Volksrust, seizing drugs with an estimated street value of $20 million. During the raid, authorities arrested five individuals from a North American country and the farm's caretaker, while two other suspects believed to be from West African nations managed to escape. The discovery included industrial manufacturing equipment and large quantities of the finished drug. This operation highlights South Africa's role as a significant consumer market and transit point for illicit drugs, a challenge exacerbated by its geography and porous borders.</p>

Anti-abortion groups, supported by some Catholic bishops, are holding "March for Life" rallies, which are expected to be met by sizable counter-protests advocating for liberal abortion laws. Simultaneously, the "Fridays for Future" movement has called for climate rallies in 70 cities, demanding an end to fossil fuel use. These climate protests come as activist Luisa Neubauer criticizes the government's recent announcement to build new gas-fired power plants while scaling back the expansion of renewable energy sources, calling it a security risk.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Limerence and How to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," explores the concept of limerence, a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of "person addiction" if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed messages, as uncertainty fuels the brain's reward system. To break free from unhealthy limerence, he recommends strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals. The key is to recognize the obsession is an internal process and actively work to shift one's mindset.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their annual conference, the party faces a critical question about its future direction after a successful general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's playful stunts, such as bungee-jumping and jet-skiing, garnered significant media attention and votes, but polling now suggests the public, including Lib Dem supporters, wants the party to appear more serious. With both the Labour and Conservative parties distracted by internal issues, there is an opportunity for the Lib Dems to expand their appeal beyond their southern English strongholds. However, the party must now develop a more substantive policy platform to capitalize on this moment and avoid being a "false start."</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly turning to AI tools like ChatGPT to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks, which costs U.S. businesses millions annually. Studies show that workplaces using AI have seen a drop in emotional exhaustion, as the technology can help rebalance workloads and provide personalized wellness nudges. However, recent data suggests a potential downside, with frequent AI users reporting higher rates of burnout. Experts warn that while AI can be a helpful assistant, the pressure to learn new systems and the tendency to fill newly freed time with more work can inadvertently increase stress, highlighting the need for mindful implementation.</p>
