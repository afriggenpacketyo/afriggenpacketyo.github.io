          <p>China's state-owned MCC is advancing on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, aiming to start extraction this year after a 17-year delay. The project, initially stalled by security issues and the presence of ancient archaeological sites, is now proceeding with plans for underground mining to better protect historical relics. Despite the progress, concerns remain regarding the preservation of the Bronze Age artifacts and the overall stability of the operation under the Taliban government, which has endorsed the new mining approach to avoid damaging the relics.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murder and a 18.6% decline in motor vehicle thefts. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, reflects a continuing downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. While experts note the positive trend, they also point out that aggravated assaults remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels and that hate crimes saw only a slight decrease.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The measure aims to protect tenants, particularly vulnerable populations, from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law, which will be enforced starting in 2027, encourages the use of passive cooling methods like blackout curtains and reflective roofing, with the goal of improving public health without solely relying on citations.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles charter school has partnered with the nonprofit Trust for Public Land to replace its asphalt playground with grass and greenery, significantly improving the outdoor environment for students. The project addresses the "concrete jungle" effect, as blacktops can reach dangerously high temperatures, by creating a play area that is up to 40 degrees cooler. This initiative highlights a broader movement to increase children's access to safe, cool green spaces, which can also help mitigate pollution and support emotional development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of older adults are turning to AI-powered chatbots, like a device named ElliQ, for companionship to combat social isolation. For retirees who live alone and have limited mobility, these devices provide hours of daily interaction through activities like trivia, conversation, and virtual travel. While users report meaningful connections that alleviate loneliness, ethicists express concern that over-reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation from human contact if not implemented responsibly. The trend highlights a novel technological approach to a significant public health issue among seniors.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling they were "irresponsible" for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog cited the use of shadows, posing, and hairstyles that made the models look "gaunt" and emphasized "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the images, stated the models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of body image representation in fashion.</p>

With uniform costs averaging over £450 for secondary students, many families struggle with the expense.
