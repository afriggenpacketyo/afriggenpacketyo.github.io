        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, reducing the deposit facility rate to 2% from a mid-2023 high of 4%. This decision follows a drop in Euro zone inflation to 1.9% in May, which is below the ECB's 2% target. The ECB cited its updated assessment of the inflation outlook and the strength of monetary policy transmission as reasons for the rate trim. However, economic growth in the Euro zone remains sluggish, with a first-quarter expansion of only 0.3%, and rising geopolitical tensions, including U.S. tariff policies, add further uncertainty to the economic outlook.

          <p>WWE star R-Truth's announcement that he was leaving the company after nearly 20 years has shocked the wrestling world, prompting reaction from his tag-team partner The Miz. The Miz expressed sadness over R-Truth's departure, acknowledging their successful run as Awesome Truth, including winning the RAW Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania 40. R-Truth, whose real name is Ron Killings, had a brief rivalry with John Cena before his departure and had been with WWE since 1999, with a break in the early 2000s to wrestle with Total Nonstop Action wrestling. The Miz celebrated R-Truth's career as one of a kind, and expressed love and support for him.</p>

The government has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029, and it also pledged ¬£13m to food charities across England.

The new interpretation, announced on May 13, allows Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson to be considered for a Hall committee vote in December 2027, while Manfred also discussed potential changes to ball/strike calls using computer technology and MLB's consideration of allowing big league players to compete in the 2028 Olympics.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is quickly gaining an edge over the U.S. in biotechnology, particularly in drug and agricultural development. The Harvard Belfer Center's "Critical and Emerging Technologies Index" suggests that biotechnology is the sector where China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States. This assessment echoes growing concerns in Washington, with the U.S. National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology urging the government to invest at least $15 billion over the next five years to bolster the domestic biotech sector. U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies have recently invested billions to acquire China-developed drugs, signaling the industry's progress.</p>

          <p>The new leader of NextGen America, Victoria Yang, is urging Democrats to embrace economic populism to win back young voters, as research indicates that young voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and their financial futures. Yang criticizes Democrats for not addressing these concerns effectively and suggests they should learn from figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who directly address economic issues. Focus groups have shown that young voters view progressives as authentic fighters for their economic well-being, while others, like Kamala Harris, are seen as inauthentic. Yang emphasizes the need for consistent engagement with young voters and the use of platforms like TikTok to connect with them authentically.</p>

          <p>While best friendships can be a source of joy and support for children, experts say they are not essential for well-being. Kids with best friends tend to be less anxious, better able to handle rejection, and more engaged in school, but pressure to have a best friend can also be stressful. Children need a repertoire of anchors, people who provide different kinds of support, and having a group of reliable friends is more important than having one particular best friend. The message is that kids don't need a certain kind of best-friendship, or even a best friend at all.</p>

          <h2>UK Inflation Rate Overstated Due to Car Tax Calculation Error</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 07:22:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) has stated that a car tax data calculation error caused the UK's inflation rate to be overstated by 0.1 percentage points for the year to April. The ONS initially reported an annual rate of 3.5% in April, but revised data shows the consumer price index rose by 3.4%. The error was identified in the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport. The statistics agency apologized for the error and said it would be using the correctly weighted data from May 2025's figures onward, "meaning no further statistics will be affected."

          <p>Data reveals that the IRS under the Biden administration has doubled the number of audits on wealthy individuals. Simultaneously, the audit rate for those making under $500,000 declined slightly in 2024, fulfilling a promise by the Biden administration. The article highlights a shift in focus towards auditing higher-income earners while reducing scrutiny on lower-income individuals, aligning with the administration's stated goals.</p>
