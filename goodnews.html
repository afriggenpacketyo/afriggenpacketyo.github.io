Authorities are now investigating how he traveled to Atlanta and if he received assistance. His capture marks the end of a manhunt that exposed security flaws in the Orleans Parish Justice Center and was significantly aided by media coverage and public engagement.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 268, officially recognizing Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as a statewide holiday starting January 1, 2026. This landmark decision makes California the third state, following Pennsylvania and Connecticut, to grant Diwali official status. The new law allows community colleges and public schools to close and state employees to take the day off for the five-day celebration, which marks the Hindu new year. Celebrated by Hindu, Sikh, and Jain faiths, Diwali emphasizes family, community, and the triumph of light over darkness, with various festivities planned across Southern California.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner lauded defender Maya Le Tissier's consistent elite performance, particularly after her match-winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut. Despite her pivotal role in United's strong defense and a record 71 consecutive WSL appearances, Le Tissier has limited international caps. With key England defenders Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze injured, speculation is rising that the 23-year-old "rock" should earn a starting position for upcoming international matches against Brazil and Australia. Skinner, while avoiding direct calls for England selection, emphasized her incredible talent and driven personality, confident she will become an England stalwart.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he "may go" to the Middle East, specifically Egypt and potentially Gaza, as early as this weekend, amidst ongoing indirect peace talks between Hamas and Israel. His top negotiators, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are already in Egypt working on a 20-point peace proposal Trump unveiled recently. The president expressed optimism about the negotiations, which reportedly involve Hamas accepting some elements of the U.S.-led plan, including the release of remaining hostages. This potential trip would occur during a federal government shutdown, adding a layer of complexity to his foreign policy efforts.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project during their meeting in Washington. Sources familiar with the discussion indicate Carney raised the issue in the context of broader talks on U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The pipeline, which would connect Alberta to the U.S., was previously approved by Canada but blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations due to environmental concerns. Despite the company behind it having "moved on," Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith welcomed the renewed discussion, seeing Alberta oil as key to North American trade.</p>

          <p>Michael Intrator, CEO of CoreWeave, dismissed concerns about "circular investments" regarding his company's deals with other artificial intelligence giants, calling the narrative "fundamentally flawed." CoreWeave, which sells cloud infrastructure for AI, has seen its stock soar over 200% since its IPO in March, driven by massive contracts with OpenAI ($22.4 billion) and Meta ($14.2 billion), and a significant order with Nvidia. Intrator asserted these deals represent a "fundamental infrastructure buildout" for major tech companies responding to demand, rather than a mere exchange of funds. He believes the "circular investment" narrative is temporary, given the enormous market drivers. (not investment advice)</p>
