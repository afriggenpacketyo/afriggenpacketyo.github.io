          <p>Calm has returned to Kathmandu following the appointment of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. Her appointment follows days of intense, youth-led anti-corruption protests that resulted in at least 51 deaths and led to the collapse of the previous government. Known for her strong anti-graft stance, Karki's selection was the result of negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives. In one of her first acts, the new prime minister recommended dissolving parliament and setting new elections for March 5, a move intended to address the economic and political grievances that fueled the widespread unrest.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both declining birth rates and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to support women returning to work after childbirth. Initially, the program will cover 20 new mothers at Shanghai’s branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who are under 40, hold a doctoral degree, and have given birth within the last two years. While the initial scope is limited, the program is seen by some female researchers as a positive step towards creating a more supportive environment in a demanding field.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Bill to Prohibit On-Duty Police from Wearing Face Coverings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 03:42:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would largely prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identity while on duty. The measure, which now awaits the governor's signature, was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where federal agents concealed their faces. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for public trust and accountability, especially after a recent Supreme Court ruling expanded agents' authority. However, law enforcement groups and Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, contending that face coverings are essential for protecting officers from harassment and ensuring their safety during dangerous operations.</p>

This event marks a significant moment for Tokyo, which hosted the 2020 Olympics without spectators due to the pandemic, and now welcomes enthusiastic crowds back to its National Stadium. Organizers have adjusted start times for endurance events like the marathon to mitigate health risks as a heatwave is forecasted to intensify in the coming days.</p>

The Huskies dominated early, leading 33-7 at halftime, driven by a strong defense that forced five fumbles and two interceptions throughout the game. Despite a massive 29-point third-quarter comeback by Mater Dei, Centennial rallied in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory. The win was particularly notable for the McKinley and Catalano families, as the younger brothers of stars from Centennial's 2015 championship team played pivotal roles in this historic game.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is shedding its old-fashioned image and gaining newfound popularity, particularly among younger generations.

This stance highlights a regional desire to maintain strong economic ties with Beijing, even as broader geopolitical strategies in Europe are being re-evaluated.</p>

          <p>Michele Kang, the owner of London City Lionesses, Washington Spirit, and Lyon, is making a significant impact on women's football with her hands-on, multi-club ownership model. She argues that this approach is a necessity for growth, allowing for pooled resources in areas like female-specific research and global scouting until the women's game achieves greater commercial revenue. Kang has invested heavily in infrastructure and talent, attracting high-profile players to the Lionesses for their first season in the Women's Super League. She refutes criticism that the model is a 'feeder system,' instead framing it as a strategy to build scale and elevate the entire sport.</p>
