          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm supplying major UK supermarkets like Tesco and Aldi, experienced a ransomware attack that encrypted their data and locked them out of computer systems, demanding payment for restoration. The attack disrupted order processing, potentially leading to food waste for clients, with Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones estimating thousands of pounds worth of meat products at risk. While smaller than recent attacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, the incident underscores cybersecurity challenges for smaller logistics companies, though transport activities remain unaffected. This article highlights the increasing vulnerability of supply chains to cyber threats and the potential consequences for food distribution and waste.</p>

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis and draws parallels to her father's Alzheimer's announcement in 1994, emphasizing the opportunity for leadership through vulnerability. Davis notes that while cancer is openly discussed today, the emotional impact often isn't, and Biden can show leadership by sharing his personal experience and fears. She argues that candor could restore trust with voters concerned about his fitness, allowing him to connect with Americans on a human level beyond politics, and soothe the fears that so many people wrestle with. The article suggests that such openness could be a profound expression of love for the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share ideological similarities as outsiders challenging the political establishment, despite stylistic differences. Both men embraced conservative ideas, with Reagan aiming to dismantle the Soviet Union and eliminate departments like Education and Energy, similar to Trump's goals. Reagan's support for gay rights, based on individual freedom, predates mainstream acceptance, and both leaders enjoyed popularity among blue-collar voters. While trade may be a point of divergence, Reagan also used tariffs to protect industries, and the author asserts that Trump continues to embrace Reagan's core principles of tax cuts, federalism, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference rate for mortgage loans, by 10 basis points in an effort to stabilize the struggling property market. The move follows previous interest rate cuts and aims to boost domestic demand and ensure economic stability amidst heightened external risks under Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidency. However, analysts suggest that the moderate cut may not be sufficient to revive the property sector, which has been a drag on the economy due to solvency issues among major real estate developers. The one-year loan prime rate, the reference rate for corporate loans, was also cut by 0.1 percentage points to 3.0 per cent.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant primary thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been unused for two decades, averting a potential loss of communication with the spacecraft. The fix was crucial as the backup thrusters were showing signs of failure, and a ground-based antenna needed to be taken offline for upgrades. The team suspected an electronics glitch caused the initial failure and devised a test to reactivate the thruster without risking an explosion. This success ensures Voyager 1 can maintain its antenna alignment with Earth, extending its mission and allowing scientists to continue gathering data from interstellar space.</p>

While many artists worry about job losses, some argue that AI serves a supporting role and will not replace human creativity.

          <p>Honda Motor Co. announced a 30% reduction in its electric vehicle (EV) investment plan through fiscal year 2030, citing slower-than-expected growth in the EV market. The investment plan has been reduced to around 7 trillion yen ($48 billion) from the previous 10 trillion yen. This revision reflects Honda's postponement of a 1.5 trillion-yen investment plan to start operations of new EV facilities in Canada, including an EV factory and battery plant, by two years from the initially planned 2028. The article notes that Honda maintains its long-term target of 100% electric and fuel-cell vehicle sales by 2040.</p>
