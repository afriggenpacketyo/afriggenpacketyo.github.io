          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 13:26:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Argentina have discovered a new species of megaraptoran dinosaur, named Joaquinraptor casali, which lived approximately 70 million years ago. The fossil, one of the most complete skeletons of this mysterious dinosaur group, was found in Patagonia with an ancient crocodile bone in its jaws. This finding provides crucial insights into its predatory behavior, suggesting it used its long arms and powerful claws for hunting, a different method from the bite-focused T. rex. The discovery helps fill a significant gap in the understanding of these unique predators from the late Cretaceous period.</p>

During a speech, he explained that the central bank monitors overall financial conditions to ensure its policies are achieving their intended goals. Despite acknowledging the lofty stock values, which have recently set record highs following an interest rate cut, Powell asserted that this is not a time of elevated financial stability risks. His remarks provide insight into the Fed's current assessment of the market environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Giants are reportedly set to make a significant change at quarterback, with rookie Jaxson Dart expected to start in their Week 4 game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The decision follows a poor performance by veteran Russell Wilson, who threw two interceptions in a recent game against the Kansas City Chiefs, drawing boos from the home crowd. Head coach Brian Daboll had indicated that an evaluation was underway to improve the team's passing game. Dart, a first-round draft pick from Ole Miss, will now have the opportunity to lead the offense against an undefeated Chargers team.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced plans to build a new $6.5 billion manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, to scale up production of its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, and other small molecule drugs. This investment is part of a broader strategy to boost domestic production capacity amid threats of tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The new plant is expected to create over 600 permanent jobs and 4,000 construction jobs. The expansion is critical for Eli Lilly to meet the anticipated high demand for its GLP-1 obesity treatments and maintain its leading position in the rapidly growing market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration must restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The funds, primarily for medical research, were suspended by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, ruling that the government likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific explanations for the funding cuts. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using federal funding to influence policies at elite universities.</p>

          <p>Health agencies and experts worldwide, including those in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Australia, are strongly refuting the Trump administration's recent announcement linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. In coordinated statements, these organizations affirmed that there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support such a causal link and that the medication remains a safe option for pain and fever during pregnancy. This international consensus directly contradicts the claims made by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., highlighting a significant disconnect between U.S. policy statements and global scientific opinion.</p>

          <p>Amidst a political landscape dominated by an aging leadership in both parties, speculation is growing about a potential 2028 presidential or Senate run for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This article explores her political trajectory, noting her shift from an unapologetically left-wing insurgent to a more established figure within the Democratic party. While her charisma and appeal to voters seeking change are undeniable, her evolving positions, particularly on foreign policy, have drawn criticism from some of her original progressive base. The piece argues that despite these complexities, AOC's fighting spirit may be what is needed to challenge the current political establishment.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is not just a stock market barometer but also a highly profitable business for its parent company, S&P Global. The company earns hundreds of millions annually by licensing the S&P 500 name and data to financial firms that create index funds and ETFs, which now hold trillions in assets. This success is protected by a strong brand, economies of scale, and its status as a common language for financial benchmarks, creating a nearly impenetrable moat against competitors. Despite recent criticism over its heavy concentration in a few tech giants, the index continues to fulfill its primary role: accurately reflecting the current state of the U.S. stock market.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years.
