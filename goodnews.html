          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a small, experimental project into a foundational technology for global finance. Now valued at over $420 billion, it serves as the underlying infrastructure for trillions in payments, stablecoins, and tokenized assets from major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. While its adoption by Wall Street signifies immense success, co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the growth but expresses concerns about potential centralization. The platform's stability and programmability are key reasons for its continued dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Entertainer Jennifer Lopez recently shared a series of photos on social media from her trip to Egypt. The 56-year-old icon posted pictures of herself in a black string bikini and a netted cover-up while relaxing in a cabana. The photos were taken during a stop on her 'Up All Night' tour, where she appeared to be staying at the Rixos Radamis Hotel in Sharm El Sheikh.

India's second innings was anchored by a sublime century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and surprise fifties from Akash Deep and Washington Sundar, setting a formidable total on a pitch that has become more favorable for batting.

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot base detentions solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit ruling agreed with a lower court that such practices violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision requires agents to have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally before making a stop. This legal battle stems from controversial raids by the Trump administration that sparked widespread protests and fear within Southern California's Latino community.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured a commanding 97-7 victory over Spain in a Rugby World Cup warm-up match, running in 15 tries. The match demonstrated England's dominance but was marred by a red card for captain Marlie Packer. Packer was sent off for a clumsy clearout, which could result in a suspension that impacts her availability for the upcoming World Cup pool stage. Despite the disciplinary issue, England's performance showcased their strength, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick and numerous other players contributing to the lopsided score against a much lower-ranked Spanish side.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the legacy of aquatic segregation that has left many Black Americans without swimming skills. The historical exclusion from pools has contributed to a stark disparity, with Black children being significantly more likely to drown than their White peers. Founder Paulana Lamonier aims to create a ripple effect by training more Black swimmers, who can then become instructors and lifeguards. Through scholarships and accessible lessons, these programs are providing opportunities for adults and children to learn vital water safety skills and overcome generational barriers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to favorable economics and a streamlined permitting process for projects under 75 megawatts, rather than state-level climate policies. However, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop installations. Despite the challenges, large-scale solar remains economically competitive with natural gas, prompting continued investment in grid infrastructure and storage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that matching your fitness routine to your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and adherence to exercise. Research published in 'Frontiers in Psychology' linked the Big Five personality traits to preferences for certain activities. For example, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group workouts like HIIT, while conscientious individuals prefer goal-oriented training like preparing for a marathon. The findings suggest that if a particular exercise isn't enjoyable, trying a different activity better suited to one's personality may be a more effective long-term strategy.</p>
