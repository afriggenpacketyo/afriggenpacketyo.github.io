        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The late actor George Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently connected himself to Ohio politics when he made inaccurate statements about then-congressional candidate John Boehner on "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1990. Wendt, whose brother-in-law was Boehner's opponent, Greg Jolivette, confused Boehner with then-Rep. Buz Lukens, who was embroiled in a sexual assault scandal. Wendt's comments led to a heated exchange between the campaigns, with Boehner's team accusing Jolivette of his own past transgressions. Boehner ultimately won the election and later became Speaker of the House, later recalling the incident with Wendt as a misunderstanding that they resolved, even sharing a drink together. </p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident prompted authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area to prevent stings. Beekeepers assisted in recovering the hives and trying to save as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, and by the next morning, most bees had returned to their hives.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital flight to the edge of space from its West Texas launch site. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and witnessed the Earth from space before returning.

This marks Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight since July 2021, bringing the total number of people launched by the company to 68, continuing its dominance in the sub-orbital tourism market.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces unavoidable tough choices in its upcoming Spending Review, as it finalizes spending plans for public services. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas like transport and the criminal justice system. While spending increased in 2024, it is projected to slow down, necessitating difficult trade-offs. The government has committed to scrutinizing every pound spent, but concerns remain about funding for key initiatives such as increasing police numbers and capping bus fares.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself is crucial to his political resilience. The acronym "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) represents the idea that Trump's implicit pitch to swing voters is that anything extreme is also provisional. This approach allows him to test limits while reassuring voters that he is willing to pull back, enabling him to recover from political setbacks and maintain a normal level of popularity in a polarized country.</p>

          <p>The skulls of 19 Black patients, who died in a New Orleans hospital in the 1870s and were sent to Germany for racist phrenological studies, have been repatriated and laid to rest. The University of Leipzig acknowledged the skulls were acquired unethically and returned them after a two-year process. A multi-faith memorial was held, followed by a jazz funeral rooted in New Orleans tradition, honoring the lives and experiences of these individuals. The ceremony emphasized building on history and moving forward, recognizing the importance of remembering and honoring the past.</p>
