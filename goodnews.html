        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent incident where a Delta passenger was asked to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted inconsistencies and confusion regarding airline policies on smokeless tobacco products. While the TSA permits these pouches in both carry-on and checked luggage, individual airlines determine their own rules for in-flight use. Delta's policy explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, treating them similarly to smoking and vaping. However, policies for other major carriers like American and United are not clearly defined on their websites, leading to debate and uncertainty among travelers about what is permissible during flights.</p>

After the fight, Topuria declared he represents the "new generation of mixed martial arts." A potential future matchup was teased with a post-fight faceoff against Paddy Pimblett, setting the stage for his next high-profile title defense.</p>

          <p>The Irish-language rap group Kneecap performed to a large crowd at the Glastonbury Festival, defying criticism from British politicians and a pending terrorism charge against one of its members. The Belfast trio is known for its pro-Palestinian stance and lyrics associated with the Irish republican movement. During their set, they led chants of "Free Palestine" and thanked festival organizers for resisting pressure to cancel their appearance. The performance highlights the ongoing intersection of music, political activism, and controversy, as the group uses its platform to address geopolitical issues despite facing canceled gigs and legal challenges elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul, 28, dominated the fight, with Chavez Jr., 39, offering little offense and remaining largely defensive behind a high guard. The victory, with scores of 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92, was met with boos from the crowd. While Paul demonstrated improved boxing skills, the quality of his opponent, who has a history of motivation issues, raises continued questions about his legitimacy in the professional boxing world, even as he calls out current champions for future fights.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. With this investment, the French state becomes the largest shareholder, positioning Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing major disparities in scale, manufacturing, and launch capabilities. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's more than 7,000, suggesting its immediate success may lie in specialized government and enterprise sectors rather than the mass market.</p>

During the outing, his four-seam fastball was clocked at 101.7 mph, the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career. Despite his strong performance on the mound, which included one strikeout and only one hit allowed, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak, but Ohtani's developing pitching form remains a positive sign for the team.</p>

          <p>New regulations banning smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and swimming pools have gone into effect across France. The rules are part of a government initiative aimed at protecting the public, especially children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke and moving towards a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban, which does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, comes as France continues to battle a high smoking rate, with over 30% of adults still smoking.</p>

This year's events are characterized by a defiant tone, mixing celebration with protest against recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender people. Organizers have adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" in response to the challenging political climate. The parades also face new headwinds from a reduction in corporate sponsorships, as some companies pull back from diversity and inclusion initiatives amid shifting public sentiment.</p>
