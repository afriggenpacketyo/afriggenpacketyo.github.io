          <p>The United States government has reversed its export restrictions on semiconductor design software for China, according to announcements from major software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This move lifts a ban imposed in May that required companies to obtain licenses before exporting certain goods to China. The decision is seen as part of a broader trade truce, with other providers like Siemens EDA also reportedly cleared to resume business. The easing of these curbs is a significant development in the ongoing tech and trade relationship between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armenia is looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, according to its foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan. This diplomatic effort is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign relations beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. The shift follows Armenia's dissatisfaction with Moscow's role during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its subsequent decision to withdraw from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Mirzoyan's visit to Beijing signals a significant move to build new alliances and strengthen its international standing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a tight vote on a major spending bill, questions have arisen about the procedure for a tie in the U.S. House of Representatives. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or motion results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is lost. This rule underscores the high stakes in the closely divided chamber, where even a few defections can derail legislation, as seen in a rare 215-215 tie vote in February 2024.</p>

          <p>China has completed the development of a record-setting hydropower turbine intended for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station in Tibet. The turbine boasts a maximum capacity of 500 megawatts, making it the world's largest single-unit capacity for this type of equipment. Developed by Harbin Electric Machinery Company, the 80-tonne turbine is constructed from durable martensitic steel. This technological achievement is a key component for the major hydropower project located on the Yuqu River, a tributary of the Nu River in southwest China.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes soaring to $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This surge, driven by mainland Chinese companies seeking funds, positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. Factors fueling the boom include supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings in mainland China, and ample market liquidity.

The FAA confirmed the part belonged to a Boeing 737 that had landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on a flight from Atlanta with 115 people on board. An inspection after landing revealed the missing section of the left wing's trailing edge flap.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that barred migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor federal law grants the power to unilaterally suspend the right to apply for asylum. The executive order, issued in January, had declared the border situation an "invasion." The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal the ruling.</p>

Officer Smith died by suicide nine days after the insurrection, and his widow successfully argued in a wrongful death lawsuit that the assault directly contributed to his death. The verdict is a significant moment for Erin Smith, who has become a powerful advocate, successfully lobbying for a law that allows some police suicides to be classified as line-of-duty deaths, a designation her husband has now received.</p>
