          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting it infringes on the president's powers under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Johnson stated that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets was within his constitutional authority. He also indicated that a resolution aimed at preventing unauthorized U.S. military action in Iran would likely fail in the House. Johnson mentioned that Representative Massie, who introduced the resolution, might reconsider in light of the announced ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should strategically consider key decisions before July, as the price of gold could potentially surge to new records. Investors should consider whether to wait for a price drop, although the potential for a significant drop is low. They should also determine how much of their portfolio to allocate to gold, typically around 10%, based on their goals and risk tolerance. Finally, it's crucial to assess whether gold aligns with their portfolio needs, such as diversification or hedging against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
