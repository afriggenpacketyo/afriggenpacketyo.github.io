          <p>A new study reveals that a tiny microchip implant, combined with special glasses, has enabled some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy to read again. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) involves surgically placing a hair-thin implant under the retina, which then communicates with video-camera-equipped glasses. Of 32 participants, 26 showed significant visual acuity improvement after 12 months. While requiring concentration and not yet licensed for widespread treatment, this breakthrough offers substantial hope for the 5 million people worldwide affected by this advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in older individuals.</p>

          <p>Hobbyist Travis Nichols, a known metal detectorist on Nantucket, discovered a rare 1782 silver Spanish one-reale coin on a south shore beach, marking a significant personal achievement. Nichols, who already boasts a collection of over 300 coins, described the finding as "an amazing feeling," valuing it above helping others find lost jewelry, for which he is locally renowned. He believes the coin was minted in Mexico City, traversing a long historical path to Nantucket, and notes its relative youth compared to other island finds from the 1650s. This discovery highlights the potential of the location, where he previously unearthed a historic clipped penny, prompting him to continue exploring the spot for more hidden treasures.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family reported he was streaming threats to "shoot it up" on social media. Police apprehended Billy Cagle, 49, upon his entry into the south terminal, and subsequently located an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his parked truck. Officials believe Cagle, a felon with mental health challenges, intended to use the weapon inside the crowded terminal. Quick action by his family and law enforcement averted a potential tragedy at the world's busiest airport. Cagle faces charges including terroristic threats and criminal attempt to commit aggravated assault.</p>

          <p>Andrew Garcia, a Lakers fan, has dropped his small claims lawsuit against LeBron James after the PrizePicks fantasy sports app offered to compensate him for ticket losses. Garcia had sued after James's "decision of all decisions" announcement, which many interpreted as a retirement tease, turned out to be unrelated to his NBA career. Believing he had overpaid for what he thought would be James's farewell tour tickets, Garcia received promo funds equivalent to his $865.66 ticket cost, along with future game tickets and merchandise from PrizePicks. This resolution satisfied Garcia, who felt fully compensated, thus eliminating the need for further legal action against the NBA superstar.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of the U.S. Constitution, highlighting its design for amendment and evolution over two centuries. Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen discuss how amendments like the 13th and 19th addressed slavery and women's suffrage, embodying the founders' intent for a "work in progress." They note the initial slender support for its ratification and the crucial role of Article V in allowing citizens to change it. While the Supreme Court now frequently reinterprets the Constitution, founders primarily envisioned change through amendments. Concerns are raised about checks and balances not functioning as intended, with Congress inactive and courts overly powerful, yet the Constitution's core principles of freedom remain eternal.</p>

          <p>Americans are projected to spend a record $13.1 billion on Halloween this year, despite facing higher prices for popular items like candy and costumes. The National Retail Federation reports an average per-person spend of $114.45, nearly $11 more than last year. Cocoa prices have more than doubled due to extreme weather impacting West African suppliers, leading to increased chocolate costs. Tariffs on imported spirits and Chinese-made decorations also contribute to price hikes. Consumers are adopting budget-friendly strategies, such as DIY décor, early shopping, and choosing generic brands, with Gen Z and Millennials particularly embracing these cost-saving measures to celebrate the holiday.</p>

Prime Minister Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement to invest in a joint critical mineral supply chain. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the Trump administration would set price floors to combat market manipulation.

Rare earths are essential for magnets used in defense, EVs, and semiconductors, with China currently dominating the global supply chain. This move aligns with the Trump administration's strategy for critical mineral independence, following China's recent export controls.

Artists like Seidy La Niña, Melanie Santiler, and Ozunaje are challenging these norms, reclaiming derogatory terms and striving for recognition against male counterparts.

It requires employers to provide "good faith estimates" of pay, updates gender language, and extends the statute of limitations for wage claims to six years for ongoing discriminatory practices.
