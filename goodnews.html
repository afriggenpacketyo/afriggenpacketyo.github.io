          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is poised to win his fourth Tour de France after maintaining his overall lead through the penultimate stage of the race. While Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever stage victory after a solo attack, Pogačar finished safely within the main group of riders. With the final day being a traditionally processional stage into Paris where the leader is not challenged, his victory is all but guaranteed, barring any unforeseen accidents. This win will further solidify his position as one of the dominant figures in modern cycling.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris captured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, edging out his teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, by a slim margin. Red Bull's Max Verstappen will start in fourth after errors on his final qualifying lap, placing him behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. In a significant setback, Lewis Hamilton was eliminated early and will start 16th after his lap time was invalidated for exceeding track limits. The qualifying session sets the stage for a potentially chaotic race, with rain forecasted for Sunday.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old dog trainer, was unexpectedly diagnosed with a terminal lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, during a routine X-ray. With his condition rapidly deteriorating and medications proving ineffective, doctors gave him less than a year to live. Despite his age and initial hesitation, he was approved for and successfully underwent a double-lung transplant. Now recovering with vastly improved lung capacity, Kennedy has a renewed perspective on life and is training a new hospital therapy puppy named Encore to celebrate his remarkable second chance.</p>

          <p>According to sources, US President Donald Trump is keen on visiting China this autumn, with officials from both nations working to arrange a trip in October or November. A previously rumored visit in September for a military parade is reportedly not happening. The potential high-level summit could occur before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. This development follows a recent meeting between the top diplomats of the U.S. and China, which was described by both sides as a positive and essential step toward improving relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan programs, a growing number of employers are introducing student loan reimbursement benefits to attract and retain workers. This trend is bolstered by a new law that permanently allows companies to contribute up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans on a tax-free basis. With federal options potentially becoming less generous for some borrowers, these workplace benefits are emerging as a critical lifeline for employees struggling with educational debt, helping them manage payments and save for the future.

          <p>China has unveiled a global action plan for artificial intelligence, just days after a similar announcement from the United States, escalating the technological competition between the two superpowers.

          <p>A review of Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," suggests its lead single "Daisies" could be the song of the summer, not for its energy but for its emotional resonance. The article posits that the album's downtempo, R&B-influenced, and slightly melancholic style perfectly captures the current cultural mood, which seems to favor soothing comfort over upbeat party anthems. This artistic shift for Bieber is seen as aligning with a broader trend in pop music towards more reserved and introspective sounds, filling a void in the summer listening landscape.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard conversation expert Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before any conversation can significantly enhance one's influence and effectiveness. This brief mental rehearsal involves thinking about potential topics, questions to ask, or goals for the interaction. By doing this forethought, individuals can appear more prepared and considerate, and it frees up cognitive resources during the chat to focus on listening and responding. This simple strategy is recommended for all interactions, from professional meetings to casual calls with friends.</p>
