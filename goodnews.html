        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fitness trainer Marfred Suazo, known as Fonz the Trainer, emphasizes strength training as crucial for older adults to maintain functional fitness and prevent age-related decline. He identifies six core movement pillars: push, pull, carry, hinge, overhead press, and squat, which target essential muscle groups for daily activities. Suazo highlights the importance of preserving skeletal muscle, especially for women, to prevent conditions like osteopenia and osteoporosis, calling it the "organ of longevity." The article encourages starting slowly with calisthenics or resistance bands, progressively increasing intensity, and combining strength training with cardiovascular activity and mobility for comprehensive health benefits and improved quality of life.</p>

          <p>A couple decided to reject traditional routines and embark on a two-year nomadic adventure, selling 90% of their possessions and living in 10 different cities across the country. This radical lifestyle shift, initially prompted by a desire for change and a fear of a boring future, led them to discover what truly matters beyond material possessions. They learned to break routines, embrace new experiences, and live on less, ultimately saving money and investing for their future. The experience strengthened their relationship and deepened their individual sense of self, inspiring them to continue prioritizing adventure and intentional living even after settling down and starting a family in Brooklyn.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals who have accumulated more retirement savings than necessary, financial advisors suggest several safe and savvy investment ideas to continue growing their wealth. Key recommendations include prioritizing tax-sheltered accounts like 401(k)s, making catch-up contributions, opening high-yield savings accounts, and utilizing CD ladders for continuous, low-risk returns. The article also advises exploring bonds, Treasury bills, and multi-year guaranteed annuities (MYGAs) for tax-efficient growth and deferred income, noting that T-bills are exempt from state taxes. Additionally, money market funds offer stability and liquidity, while deferred income annuities can provide a lifetime income stream, ensuring a robust financial legacy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This article refutes the assertion that the current generation is the "sickest in American history," a claim often made by movements like Make America Healthy Again. It presents extensive evidence of significant public health improvements over decades, including a dramatic increase in life expectancy to 78.4 years and successful campaigns against infectious diseases, heart attacks, and cancer. The piece highlights cleaner environments, safer workplaces, and advances in medical diagnostics that now identify conditions previously missed. While acknowledging present health challenges like obesity and mental illness, the article argues against catastrophizing the current moment, advocating for building upon existing public health achievements rather than dismantling the system.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management is pressing for a merger between Performance Food Group (PFG) and US Foods, nominating four candidates to PFG's board to facilitate this. Sachem Head, known for successful activist campaigns, highlights the substantial synergistic potential, estimated at $800 million to over $1 billion, in combining the second and third largest foodservice distributors. While a previous Sysco-US Foods merger was blocked on antitrust grounds, this article suggests a PFG-US Foods combination might fare differently due to PFG's regional footprint and a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. The move aims to create significant long-term value for all shareholders (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group shares surged nearly 30% following Berkshire Hathaway's mid-August disclosure of a new stake, though it remains unclear if Berkshire's investment is currently profitable on paper. While the stock had already begun to recover from its yearly low, Berkshire's endorsement significantly boosted its recent gains. Analysts are incrementally positive after meeting with UnitedHealth's management, with Morgan Stanley raising its price target. This article also notes that Kraft Heinz shares slipped after its plan to split into two companies, a move Warren Buffett reportedly opposed, leading to speculation about Berkshire potentially divesting its stake, creating a mixed outlook for Berkshire's portfolio (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to convenience stores, with morning meal traffic rising 9% at food-forward c-stores compared to a 1% increase at fast-food chains. This trend, driven by regional chains investing in foodservice options and major players like 7-Eleven planning expansion, indicates a significant shift in consumer behavior. Fast-food giants like McDonald's acknowledge breakfast as their weakest daypart, attributing it to economically stressed consumers. Convenience stores offer perceived "good bang for their buck," a wider variety of options beyond traditional fast-food, and the added convenience of being co-located with gas pumps, making quality and variety key differentiators in this competitive market shift.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships commenced in Tokyo, drawing tens of thousands of spectators, four years after the city hosted the pandemic-delayed Olympics without fans. The event is notable for the re-imposed requirement for female athletes to undergo a gene test to determine sex, with 95% complying with the September 1 deadline. World Athletics President Sebastian Coe defends the policy as protecting the integrity of women's sports, though critics view the test as unreliable and a spillover from "culture wars" opposing transgender inclusion. This article highlights the return of major sporting events with fan attendance, but also the ongoing controversy surrounding gender testing in athletics and its broader societal implications for athlete rights and fairness.</p>

          <p>Scientists are urging the US to recognize Chagas disease, spread by "kissing bugs," as an endemic illness to increase public awareness and improve diagnosis and treatment. Many people, including a Miami high school student who tested positive after donating blood, are unaware of the disease, which is prevalent in Latin America but also present in at least eight US states. While often asymptomatic initially, Chagas can lead to serious chronic issues like heart failure years later.

This trend has also propelled companies like Broadcom, Microsoft, and Nvidia, collectively adding trillions to their market caps and sustaining sharp market rallies.

          <p>Travel experts, including Google Flights, consistently advise flexibility as the most crucial factor for securing cheap airfare. Shifting travel by even a day or two, particularly flying midweek (Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays), can significantly reduce costs, making tickets up to 13% less expensive than weekend flights. This article debunks the myth that the day of booking heavily influences price, emphasizing that the day of travel is paramount. Additionally, traveling during shoulder or off-peak seasons, opting for layovers, and booking well in advance (around 39-49 days prior for domestic and international flights, respectively) are effective strategies to find more affordable flights and hotel stays.</p>

Initially a solution to post-WWII housing shortages and promoted as socialist ideals, the Plattenbau became associated with "painful transformation" after German reunification, including the rise of extremism.
