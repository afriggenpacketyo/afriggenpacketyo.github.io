        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neuroscientist discusses the complexities of animal instincts, arguing against the simplistic view that they are solely inborn or genetically programmed. The article explores how behaviors are shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and learning. Examples like the tailorbird's nest-building and a border collie's herding instincts are used to illustrate the interplay between innate tendencies and learned behaviors. The discussion emphasizes the importance of considering the broader system in which behaviors occur, rather than attributing them solely to genetics or instinct.</p>
