        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of seven leading women's organizations has warned the UK government against diluting its flagship Employment Rights Bill, arguing that doing so would threaten a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity to close the gender pay gap. In a letter to the new business secretary, the groups expressed concern over amendments from the House of Lords that could weaken protections, such as those for zero-hours contract workers. The organizations emphasized that women, who are disproportionately represented in low-paid and insecure work, stand to benefit most from the bill's proposed reforms, which include enhanced rights to flexible working and statutory sick pay.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has ushered in a new era for Jamaican sprinting by winning the men's 100m gold at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, becoming the first Jamaican man to claim a global 100m title since Usain Bolt in 2016. The 24-year-old, who is coached by Bolt's former mentor Glen Mills, delivered a personal best time of 9.77 seconds to secure the victory. The win was particularly significant as it came after disappointments at the previous world championships and the Paris Olympics. His triumph, celebrated by Bolt in the stands, signals a resurgence for Jamaica in men's sprinting.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his nearly $80 million in career earnings into a variety of tech startups and venture capital funds. Following the example of other financially savvy athletes, Barkley has chosen to live off his endorsement deals while investing his NFL salary. His portfolio is said to include stakes in AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This strategy reflects a growing trend among professional athletes to secure long-term financial stability and create generational wealth beyond their relatively short playing careers.

In a speech in Sunderland, she warned against internal divisions, stating they would only benefit political rivals like Nigel Farage. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, who resigned over her tax affairs, and pledged to continue Rayner's active campaigning role. She is competing against former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the position, which was vacated following Rayner's departure from the high-profile post.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team secured a place in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals by defeating Scotland 40-8 in Bristol, marking their record 31st consecutive Test victory. Despite Scotland scoring first with a penalty, England dominated the match, establishing a 26-3 lead by halftime with tries from Kelsey Clifford and Morwenna Talling, among others. The victory continues an extraordinary run of form for England, whose only loss in their last 62 matches was in the 2022 World Cup final. They will now face France in the semi-final for a chance to advance to the championship match.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has maintained a perfect start to their Premier League season with a series of dramatic, late-game victories, a trend now being dubbed "Arne Time" in homage to manager Arne Slot. The team has secured all four of its league wins with goals scored in the final minutes, including a 100th-minute winner against Newcastle and a last-second penalty to defeat Burnley. This pattern of securing points in the dying moments of matches has become a new phenomenon for the club, creating a psychological advantage over opponents. The champions' resilience demonstrates a strong winning mentality even when not playing at their absolute best.</p>

          <p>Modern theme parks, like Universal's new Epic Universe, are investing billions to create hyper-immersive and physically overwhelming experiences to compete for attention in a digital age.
