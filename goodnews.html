          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a dramatic rebound, with fundraising volumes reaching their highest point since 2021. This surge is driven by Chinese companies seeking listings, spurred by regulatory support from Beijing, ample market liquidity, and concerns about potential delistings from U.S. exchanges. The city is now positioned to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year, a significant turnaround after several years of lackluster activity. The renewed interest is also fueled by a rally in Chinese tech stocks and mainland investors pouring capital into Hong Kong shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy may increase breast cancer risk for menopausal women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, which is typically prescribed for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines previous understandings from older studies, highlighting how the specific type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Experts emphasize that this treatment remains highly effective for menopausal symptoms and advise personalized consultation with a doctor.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down a Trump administration order that sought to ban people from applying for asylum if they crossed the southern border between official ports of entry. In the ruling, Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president does not have the authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by several immigrant rights groups. They argued the flat-out ban on asylum endangered people fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries.</p>

The concert, titled "Back to the Beginning," marks the end of a tumultuous career defined by pioneering heavy metal music and a notoriously wild rock-and-roll lifestyle. Despite decades of substance abuse, accidents, and a Parkinson's diagnosis, the 76-year-old will headline a stadium show featuring bands he influenced, such as Metallica and Slayer. This farewell performance is seen as a genuine swansong, bringing his legendary career full circle to where it began.</p>

The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing Chinese products from circumventing U.S. tariffs.
