          <p>Doncaster electrician Josh Padley unexpectedly launched his full-time boxing career after taking a last-minute fight against WBC world champion Shakur Stevenson. Despite suffering his first professional defeat, this high-profile bout secured him a significant pay cheque and a multi-fight deal with Matchroom promoters, enabling him to quit his day job. Padley views this pivotal opportunity as a global announcement and is now preparing for his debut in the super-featherweight division against Reece Bellotti, marking a new adventure.

          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are significantly expanding their presence in Africa, boosting the continent's medicine manufacturing capabilities as part of China's "Health Silk Road" initiative. Nigeria is slated to produce Chinese-made insulin, while Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical is completing a €50 million facility in Ivory Coast for antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. These projects aim to address Africa's substantial reliance on medicine imports, given that the continent bears a quarter of the world's disease burden. This strategic expansion by China seeks to fill critical medicine manufacturing gaps and enhance public health infrastructure across the region.</p>

          <p>Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is the overwhelming favorite for the Premier League Golden Boot, having scored nine goals in his first seven games this season without a single penalty. His exceptional start is attributed to both his prolific finishing and the remarkably high quality and quantity of chances he receives, boasting an average expected goals (xG) value of 0.27 per shot. While the European Golden Shoe race is more competitive with Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe also performing strongly, Haaland's statistical superiority and the strategic changes in his team's play position him as a dominant force. This article highlights his impressive efficiency and potential.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, recently released after over a decade in Egyptian jails, shared his journey of recovery and re-acclimation with the BBC, stating he is "learning how to get back into life." Granted a presidential pardon, he described the "sensory overwhelm" of freedom and the joy of reconnecting with his family, particularly his niece and son. Abdel Fattah, a prominent figure during the 2011 uprising, endured harsh prison conditions and hunger strikes. While his days of street activism are "definitely" over, he remains committed to a fight for a better world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is currently debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, often termed "catcalling," which is not explicitly covered by existing sexual offenses or insult laws. The center-left Social Democrats argue this legal loophole needs closing, citing the significant impact on victims who feel intimidated and withdraw from public spaces. While some politicians support the move, others question the practicality of new legislation, suggesting awareness campaigns or reinterpreting existing laws might be more effective. The debate reflects a broader European trend, with several countries already having such laws in place, aiming to better protect individuals from unwanted public harassment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have identified a significant "mismatch" between fertility incentives and actual birth rates across the country, according to a recent study published in Population and Economics. Guangdong, a southern economic powerhouse, contributes the most newborns but simultaneously offers one of the poorest environments for childbirth support. This finding suggests that China's current policies and support mechanisms are not effectively influencing family planning decisions or boosting fertility rates as intended. The study's authors emphasize the critical need for deeper research into the intrinsic connections between fertility conditions and support to inform more scientific and effective policymaking.</p>

The compact sought to cap foreign admissions, restrict political comments by university leaders, and enforce a binary gender definition.
