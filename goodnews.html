          <p>German researchers have announced the discovery of 31 shipwrecks in Lake Constance, a finding that includes two large metal hulls believed to belong to World War II-era paddle steamers. The "Wrecks and Deep Sea" project, initiated in 2022, has been utilizing divers and remotely operated vehicles to investigate underwater anomalies. Among the discoveries is a remarkably well-preserved cargo sailing ship with its mast still intact, protected by the deep water from invasive mussels. The project underscores the lake's role as a historical time capsule, with research efforts scheduled to continue through the summer of 2027.</p>

This vote of confidence comes after a difficult year for UnitedHealth, which has faced a Justice Department investigation and had seen its stock fall by nearly 50% in 2025.

Speaking on a podcast during the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, Clinton emphasized that a successful outcome must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed a hope that Trump would stand up to Putin for the sake of Ukrainian democracy and U.S. security interests. In response, Trump told Fox News that Clinton's remarks were "very nice."</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by offering a simple, customizable pickup truck. The company's basic model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can upgrade with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. By minimizing initial manufacturing costs, Slate aims to address the high sticker price that deters many American car shoppers. However, with the rollback of federal EV incentives, the truck's price point may become less competitive against other models in the sub-$30,000 range, such as the Ford Maverick.</p>

The decision comes as regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and other key players are being rested. The appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer and has never captained at the full senior level before. The selection has been described as an opportunity for Bethell to develop his leadership skills on the international stage.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited a series of social media posts in which Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with actual malice and that punitive damages were warranted to deter similar behavior. Stewartson claimed he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described the legal action as an attempt to intimidate his reporting.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises has announced it is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, Florida, joining a list of companies leaving California for more business-friendly states. CEO Ben Kohn cited California's high costs and "anti-business" environment as primary reasons for the relocation. The move includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios to support the company's creator network and licensing businesses. Miami Beach officials welcomed the move, which represents a strategic return to South Florida, where the brand operated a prominent club and hotel in the 1960s and 70s.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Alaska for their summit, a military flyover featuring a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and F-35 fighter jets was conducted. The display of air power at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson included the same type of long-range bomber used in a recent U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. The B-2 is considered a potent symbol of American military might, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions on global missions. The flyover served as a powerful backdrop for the high-stakes diplomatic discussions between the two world leaders.</p>

          <p>Following a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund high-speed electric vehicle chargers along highways. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, had its funds frozen in February. The Department of Transportation has now issued new guidance that allows funding to resume but removes several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that while he disagrees with subsidizing green energy, the administration will respect Congress's decision.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a government stake in the struggling chipmaker Intel, a move that some analysts argue is essential for U.S. national security. The potential intervention aims to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. News of the possible government investment caused Intel's stock to climb, finishing the week up 23%. While government ownership of a private enterprise is unconventional, proponents argue it is necessary to ensure the domestic production of critical technology, especially with the rise of advanced artificial intelligence.

The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment nearly two and a half years after their arrest. The ruling is a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including Rico conspiracy indictments. The judge noted that the state's delays were purposeful and had caused "actual prejudice" to the defendant.</p>
