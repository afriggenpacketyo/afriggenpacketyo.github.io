          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell demonstrated a powerful return from a four-month injury recovery, striking out ten batters over five scoreless innings in a 9-1 win against the Toronto Blue Jays. The two-time Cy Young award winner's performance underscores the strength of the Dodgers' now fully intact starting rotation. The team's offense was bolstered by home runs from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani, whose 40th homer of the season was a notable highlight. This victory strengthens the Dodgers' position as they head towards the postseason with a formidable pitching staff.</p>

Coach Sean McVay expressed optimism, stating that Stafford "looked good" and threw without limitations, calling it a "good step in the right direction." The 37-year-old quarterback is dealing with an aggravated disc issue but is expected to progress back into practice soon.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was not playing in the preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, was inadvertently leveled by a sprinting official on the sideline. The collision, which occurred while Lamb was watching a play in street clothes, resulted in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Cowboys for making contact with an official. Lamb appeared uninjured and laughed off the incident with teammates. The penalty negated part of a significant gain Dallas had made on the preceding play due to a pass interference call.</p>

          <p>In the Rams' 31-21 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys, rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his potential to take on a larger role in the offense. Corum rushed for 32 yards and two touchdowns, suggesting he could help ease the workload of star running back Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, showing increased confidence. The game provided a promising look at the Rams' depth, particularly in the running back position and with their developing defensive players.</p>

          <p>The "quiet luxury" trend of subtle, understated opulence is giving way to a resurgence of "loud luxury," characterized by bold logos, visible branding, and statement designs. Fashion houses like Gucci, Burberry, and Versace are embracing this shift to inject novelty and reignite consumer interest amid a sector-wide slowdown. Analysts suggest this is a cyclical change, driven by the need for newness after several years of minimalist aesthetics. This move comes as many brands struggle with soft consumer sentiment and the after-effects of significant pandemic-era price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for "functional beverages" that promise benefits like calm and relaxation is growing rapidly, despite skepticism from health experts. Brands like Trip, which was recently cited by advertising regulators for making unproven health claims, formulate their drinks with supplements such as L-theanine and Lion's Mane mushroom. However, dietitians and nutritionists question whether the small amounts of these ingredients can produce their advertised effects. Psychologists suggest that the calming experience may be a placebo effect, created by the ritual of consuming a special, mindful beverage rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure on the Left Bank, selling copies of Le Monde. Once one of dozens of hawkers, he is now the sole practitioner of a trade made nearly obsolete by digital media. Despite declining sales, Mr. Akbar continues his work for the joy and independence it brings, and he will be decorated by President Emmanuel Macron, who was once one of his student customers.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, that he considers himself "culturally Irish" has ignited a broader conversation about identity in 2025. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection to the country where his musical tastes were formed. The article explores the complex, evolving nature of what it means to be Irish, touching on the experiences of the diaspora, the multifaceted identities in Northern Ireland, and the cross-fertilization of cultures between Ireland and Britain.

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has received overwhelmingly negative reviews, sparking a discussion about why some audiences are drawn to "bad" movies. With a near-0% score on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has intrigued viewers who find entertainment in poorly executed or unintentionally funny productions. Experts and film fans suggest that earnestly made but flawed films can be more memorable and enjoyable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. This phenomenon has created cult followings for movies like "The Room" and "Samurai Cop," which are celebrated for being so bad they're good.</p>
