          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home tool as an alternative to the Pap smear for cervical cancer screening. Developed by Teal Health, the device allows women to collect a vaginal sample using a swab, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV testing. Studies have shown that at-home screening is as effective as in-office procedures and is preferred by women, potentially increasing screening rates. The device will be available by prescription for women 25-65 years old at average risk.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir, "Who Knew," TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller reflects on the importance of instinct over data in decision-making. He argues that relying solely on data can be harmful to instinct and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. Diller shares anecdotes from his time at ABC, highlighting successful projects that were driven by instinct rather than extensive research. He emphasizes the value of simple human instinct in making both creative and business decisions.</p>
