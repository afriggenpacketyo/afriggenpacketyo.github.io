          <p>This NPR "Throughline" article explores the critical origins and applications of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which clarifies the process of presidential succession and disability. It details the journey of John Feerick, a young lawyer who, years before President John F. Kennedy's assassination, recognized the need for explicit guidelines in the Constitution regarding a president's inability to serve. The amendment provides essential frameworks for ensuring governmental continuity during unforeseen circumstances, such as presidential illness or death. This historical context highlights a significant effort to fortify the stability and resilience of American democratic institutions, ensuring a smooth transfer of power.</p>

          <h2>UK Economy Shows Better-Than-Expected Growth in Second Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:53:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics, surpassing Reuters' economist forecasts. This growth was largely led by the services sector, with strong performances in computer programming, health, and vehicle leasing, alongside an increase in construction. Despite this positive data, which included a 0.4% month-on-month growth in June, economists express caution that this momentum is unlikely to persist into the third quarter. Concerns remain regarding a softening labor market and persistent inflationary pressures, suggesting the Bank of England may keep interest rates steady for the remainder of the year.

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a $21,600 copyright claim against Pinkfong's globally viral children's song "Baby Shark," ruling that US composer Jonathan Wright's 2011 rendition lacked sufficient originality for protection. Both versions of the song are based on a traditional melody widely popular at US summer camps, which the court determined to be in the public domain. This final decision upholds previous lower court rulings from 2021 and 2023, solidifying Pinkfong's position that "Baby Shark" is derived from a traditional singalong chant. The popular children's tune has amassed over 16 billion views on YouTube since its 2015 release.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record $6.1 billion, marking the largest sale price ever for an American professional sports team. Chisholm's Symphony Technology Group will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control projected by 2028, potentially increasing the total franchise value to $7.3 billion. This landmark transaction surpasses previous records for sports team acquisitions, including the Washington Commanders NFL team and the Phoenix Suns NBA team. The previous ownership, led by Wyc Grousbeck, had purchased the Celtics in 2002 for $360 million and celebrated two NBA championships during their tenure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of BTec qualifications, which are practical, vocational courses assessed through a combination of exams, coursework, and projects. BTec Firsts are designated as Level 2, equivalent to GCSEs, while BTec Nationals are Level 3 qualifications, comparable to A-levels, often serving as pathways to university or direct employment. BTecs are graded on a scale including Starred Distinction, Distinction, Merit, and Pass. The article highlights a significant policy shift: the Labour government has paused and reversed plans to withdraw funding for 157 "key courses" in sectors like health and engineering, ensuring their continued availability until at least 2026 or 2027.</p>

          <p>Voltify, a startup co-founded by Daphna Langer and Alon Kessel, aims to decarbonize the $80-billion US rail industry by transitioning from diesel to rechargeable battery power. The company envisions its "VoltCars"—essentially sodium-ion batteries on wheels—connecting to existing freight locomotives, projecting potential annual earnings of up to $10 billion and industry savings of $94 billion over two decades. Despite initial skepticism from the traditional rail sector regarding charging time and consistent power supply, Voltify has developed an algorithm to forecast energy demands and is constructing solar-powered microgrids. The company is actively engaged in discussions with major railroad companies and plans pilot projects to demonstrate the viability of this innovative shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A TravelPerk survey reveals that over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing loved ones, including partners, children, and even pets, on work trips. This trend, known as "bleisure" travel, is driven by a desire to reclaim family time and achieve cost savings by leveraging company-covered travel expenses for personal leisure. While some employees keep these arrangements quiet, many companies, like Omic, are increasingly supportive, provided business objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated. This growing practice is projected to expand significantly, with the blended travel market valued at $315 billion in 2022 and forecast to reach $731 billion globally by 2032.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who report drinking alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a figure not seen since 1958. This decline coincides with growing public awareness and concern about the health risks associated with even moderate alcohol consumption, a shift in scientific consensus from earlier beliefs about potential benefits. Younger generations, in particular, show a greater inclination to abstain and view moderate drinking as harmful. Experts attribute this trend to increased health knowledge, greater social acceptance of sobriety, the popularity of no-drinking challenges like Dry January, and the rising cost of alcohol, suggesting a potential long-term shift in societal norms.</p>

          <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that popular mousse sunscreen products, including those from Supergoop!, may not effectively protect users from harmful UV rays. The FDA also highlights a significant safety concern: these products are often packaged to resemble whipped cream containers, which increases the risk of accidental ingestion, particularly by children. Warning letters were sent to five companies, including Vacation Inc. and Supergoop!, stating that their products are unapproved drugs and are misbranded due to their food-like packaging. Supergoop! has publicly committed to addressing these "product labeling" matters to ensure full compliance with regulations.</p>
