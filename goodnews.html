          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs surged 17% after the company announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This strategic move aligns with the U.S. government's goal of creating a domestic supply chain for critical minerals to reduce dependence on China. CEO Lourenco Goncalves emphasized the company's mining expertise and its intent to contribute to American mineral independence. The announcement has fueled positive investor speculation amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to support domestic rare earth producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude within the week. He suggested that moderate Democrats might soon move to reopen the government, allowing for subsequent policy negotiations. However, Hassett also warned that the Trump administration could consider "stronger measures" to compel cooperation if the stalemate continues. The shutdown stems from a partisan disagreement over federal funding, particularly concerning the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats are demanding.

          <p>The Afghanistan women's national soccer team, now rebranded as Afghan Women United, is set to play its first official matches since 2021 after being forced into exile by the Taliban's return to power. The games will take place in Morocco as part of the "FIFA Unites: Women's Series," after the original host, the UAE, denied the players visas. This return marks a significant moment for the players, who see it as an opportunity to represent Afghan women who have been silenced and stripped of their rights. The tournament, which also includes Chad and Libya, was quickly relocated, demonstrating FIFA's commitment to supporting the team.</p>

          <h2>Career Expert Offers Strategies for Managing a Controlling Boss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 11:04:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding provides five practical strategies for dealing with a 'control freak' boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. She advises employees to present rough drafts to invite early input, reinforce their boss's authority with deferential language, and overshare information to satisfy the need for oversight. Other techniques include preemptively asking for feedback to get ahead of criticism and explicitly requesting positive reinforcement to understand what is being done well. These methods are designed to conserve an employee's energy while navigating a challenging professional relationship by working with, rather than against, a manager's controlling tendencies.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Electric Vehicles Depreciate Faster Than Gasoline Cars</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 11:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. This trend is attributed to several factors, including historically higher government and manufacturer incentives that lower the initial cost and, consequently, the resale value. The rapid pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, also makes older models less desirable on the used market. However, with an influx of more affordable EV models expected and a growing used market, this depreciation gap may begin to narrow as EVs become more mainstream.</p>

          <p>This article details the process and eligibility requirements for filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a legal procedure that can wipe out most unsecured debts. The primary obstacle for applicants is the 'means test,' which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with incomes below the median typically qualify automatically, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The court also considers factors like recent bankruptcy filings, completion of credit counseling, and any signs of fraudulent activity, such as luxury spending just before filing, which could lead to a denial.</p>

His campaign also emphasized preserving the secular identity of the Turkish Cypriot community against perceived interference from Ankara.

          <p>Amid recent market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies for greater stability. He argues that these funds offer more structural protection because their performance is not solely reliant on stock correlations and can provide income that is less sensitive to interest rate changes. Burrello highlights the growing demand for defensive investment approaches that can generate income without depending on Federal Reserve policy decisions. He advises investors to look for ETFs managed by experienced professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Economist's annual "Carrie Bradshaw index" has identified the most affordable U.S. cities for individuals to live alone, with Wichita, Kansas, ranking at the top. The index determines affordability by calculating the salary needed to spend no more than 30% of gross income on a studio apartment. This year's report noted a shift, with several cities in Texas, such as Dallas and Austin, moving from the affordable to unaffordable category, potentially due to an influx of middle-class workers driving up rent. The number of unaffordable cities in the index rose to 41, up from 38 last year.</p>

          <p>This article argues that state Medicaid programs should cover GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic for the estimated 14 million adult beneficiaries suffering from obesity. The author calls them "near-miracle drugs" that not only lead to significant weight loss but also show benefits for related health conditions, ultimately improving longevity. While acknowledging the high cost is a major barrier, the piece contends that these expenses are overstated. It suggests that long-term healthcare savings, Medicaid's ability to negotiate lower prices, and the expected decrease in drug costs over time make universal coverage both a moral and economically sound decision.</p>
