          <p>Manchester City secured a dominant 6-0 victory against Al Ain in the Club World Cup, showcasing their attacking prowess.

          <p>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder to their first NBA championship since relocating from Seattle, scoring 29 points and providing 12 assists in a 103-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers. The Thunder, who were the best team throughout the season, completed their climb to the top, marking the end of their rebuild. The Pacers struggled after losing Tyrese Haliburton to an early leg injury, and despite Bennedict Mathurin's 24 points, they couldn't overcome the Thunder's dominance, especially in the third quarter. This victory marks the second championship for the franchise, with the first being the Seattle SuperSonics' win in 1979.</p>

          <p>Kyoto experienced a record high of 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, contributing to a total of 56.06 million visitors, the second highest on record. Despite overtourism-related challenges, satisfaction among both foreign and Japanese tourists remained high. Foreign visitors primarily focused on temples, shrines, and historic sites, while Japanese visitors expressed more disappointment with the crowds. A lodging tax increase is planned to address overtourism, and the Kyoto tourism survey indicated that the majority of visitors were at least fairly satisfied with their experience.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan approaches its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. Foreign affairs experts suggest that China may announce a new panda loan during high-level bilateral talks to stabilize relations with Tokyo amid escalating tensions with the U.S. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, and China's decisions on leasing them abroad are typically revealed during significant bilateral discussions. However, some experts doubt that the gesture will carry the same diplomatic weight as it once did.</p>

          <h2>Conscious Parenting: Avoiding Toxic Phrases to Foster Cooperation in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who rarely encounter defiance avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, instead using language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries promotes cooperation. The key is to create an environment where children feel respected, emotionally safe, and involved, leading to reduced power struggles and emotionally resilient children. This approach shifts from control to empathy and leadership, viewing defiance as a call for connection or support.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England, but only for those meeting strict criteria, such as a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage workload and resources, prioritizing those most in need. Some GP practices are warning ineligible patients not to book appointments, and pharmacy organizations are concerned about potential supply shortages. Mounjaro, initially for type 2 diabetes, promotes weight loss by reducing appetite, and eligible patients will receive wrap-around care, including exercise and diet support.</p>

          <h2>China Dominates Electric Vehicle Market Through Strategic Government Support</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:17:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs) through a strategic master plan involving long-term planning and extensive government funding. The Chinese government spent an estimated $231 billion from 2009 to 2023 developing the EV industry, providing subsidies to consumers, carmakers, electricity providers, and battery suppliers. This support has enabled companies like BYD and CATL to thrive and dominate the EV market. While other countries impose taxes on Chinese EVs, the UK does not, making it an attractive market for firms like XPeng and BYD.</p>
