          <p>The UK jobs market weakened in the first quarter of 2025, with payroll numbers declining, according to the Office for National Statistics. Job vacancies also decreased, indicating a cooling demand for labor. Wage growth experienced a slowdown, but regular earnings continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation, providing some relief for workers facing increased living costs. This mixed data suggests a complex economic environment where employment opportunities are becoming more limited while wages still manage to outpace inflation, reflecting ongoing adjustments in the UK economy.</p>

UBS estimates China's GDP growth in 2025 could climb to between 3.7% and 4%, while Morgan Stanley anticipates companies may expedite exports to capitalize on lower tariffs.

Experts suggest that China's technological progress may not be sufficient to overcome these structural economic issues, as advanced manufacturing constitutes a smaller portion of China's output compared to real estate.
