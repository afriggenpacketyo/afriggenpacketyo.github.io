          <p>The helicopter carrying President Donald Trump, known as Marine One, was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Luton Airport due to a minor hydraulic issue while concluding a state visit to the UK. The White House confirmed the diversion was made out of an abundance of caution, and the presidential party safely transferred to a support helicopter to continue their journey. The incident caused a brief delay but did not disrupt the president's travel schedule back to the United States.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin is urging his fellow Democrats to vote in favor of a Republican-led resolution that honors the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Raskin described the measure as a potential "obvious political trap" but emphasized the importance of rising above partisan politics to condemn all forms of political violence. By supporting the resolution, he argues, Democrats can demonstrate a unified American stance against such atrocities, rather than getting caught in the bill's potentially divisive wording.</p>
