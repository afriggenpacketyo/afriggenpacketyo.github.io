          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a stay, temporarily pausing a lower court's decision that had blocked President Trump's tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will expedite its review of the case, which questions whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, expressed disappointment but remains confident that the court will ultimately find the tariffs unlawful. The White House defended the administration's use of executive powers to address trade deficits and drug trafficking. Optimism remains cautious as the legal battle continues, with oral arguments scheduled for late July.</p>
