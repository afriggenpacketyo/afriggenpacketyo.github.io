          <p>Elephants Billy and Tina have been transferred from the Los Angeles Zoo to the Tulsa Zoo despite ongoing protests and objections. The transfer occurred overnight to ensure optimal temperatures and minimal traffic, with the journey taking approximately 26 hours. The L.A. Zoo cited the need for a larger herd size and enclosure as reasons for the move, selecting the Tulsa Zoo for its 17-acre space and existing elephant population. Animal advocates continue to criticize the decision, while the L.A. Zoo plans to reimagine the vacated space for other species.</p>

          <p>News of former President Biden's advanced prostate cancer has renewed debate about the value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests for midlife and older men. While PSA tests can help detect aggressive cancers, they also carry risks of false positives and overtreatment, leading to unnecessary biopsies and side effects. Experts emphasize the importance of targeting and treating aggressive cancers while monitoring those unlikely to cause harm. Conflicting guidelines and the complexity of prostate cancer screening can make decision-making challenging for both physicians and patients.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump illegally fired members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, ordering the reinstatement of those challenging their dismissals. The judge determined that Congress intended to shield board members from arbitrary removal, emphasizing the board's role in overseeing government counterterrorism activities. The ruling underscores the importance of an independent agency and protects it from political interference. The Justice Department has not yet commented on the ruling.</p>

          <p>The FDA has cleared the first blood test for detecting amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, potentially revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. The test, intended for individuals 55 and older with cognitive symptoms, offers a less invasive and more accessible alternative to PET scans and spinal taps. Experts believe the blood test will improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate earlier diagnoses, and expand access to testing in underserved areas, ultimately enabling more patients to receive timely and appropriate treatment. The Alzheimer's Association is developing guidelines to help healthcare providers counsel patients on test results and treatment options.</p>
