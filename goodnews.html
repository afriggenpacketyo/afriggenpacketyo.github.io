          <p>Following a significant victory over a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is preparing to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon. While Raducanu has shown progress this season, she acknowledges the substantial gap between her and the sport's top players, citing a need for more "weapons" in her game. The article notes that Sabalenka's powerful, aggressive style makes her the favorite, especially on the fast grass courts. Raducanu hopes that playing at home will provide an advantage as she attempts to secure a place in the last 16.</p>

          <p>Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has admitted to feeling nervous ahead of the band's final farewell performance at Villa Park in their hometown of Birmingham. The concert will feature the original lineup, including Ozzy Osbourne, for the first time in 20 years, though Osbourne's participation will be limited due to health issues. Iommi described the hometown show as a uniquely nerve-wracking experience, even more so than playing for much larger crowds. He confirmed this will be the band's definitive final performance, hoping it will end their legendary career on a high note.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated he "understands what anchors" US President Donald Trump, citing a personal connection built on shared family values despite their different political backgrounds. Speaking on a BBC program, Starmer revealed that Trump had called to console him after his brother's death, building a rapport that he believes helped secure a crucial deal on US tariffs. Starmer defended his focus on foreign relations, arguing that building strong personal ties with world leaders like Trump and France's Emmanuel Macron is vital for the UK's national interest and has yielded tangible benefits.</p>

          <p>The medical device company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the technology. The device functions differently from a hearing aid by bypassing damaged inner ear cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. According to the company's chief technology officer, the implant is designed for users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom traditional aids are ineffective. The launch, facilitated through Hainan and Hong Kong, marks a significant step for the company in the rapidly growing Chinese healthcare market.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have once again vowed to tackle the persistent issues of oversupply and excessive low-price competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated it will guide companies to improve quality and manage the phase-out of outdated production capacity. This follows a directive from President Xi Jinping to curb "disorderly low-price competition" across industries. The announcement comes as China's solar sector, a global leader, continues to navigate internal economic pressures while expanding its international market presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a key early primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. The tour will take him through eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While a political advisor denies the trip is about a presidential run, insisting the focus is on the 2026 midterms, the move is seen as an overture to Southern voters. Newsom has made similar trips and ad buys in other Southern states in recent years.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully cultivated a heart structure containing human cells within a pig embryo, reporting that it beat on its own for 21 days. The research, led by the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, involved reprogramming human stem cells to enhance their survival in the host embryo. These modified cells were then implanted into pig embryos at an early stage of development. This breakthrough in chimera research follows the same team's previous success in growing human kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for organ generation for transplants.</p>
