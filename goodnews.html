          <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, a distinguished figure in British politics and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has passed away at the age of 84. Known affectionately as Ming, he served as the Member of Parliament for North East Fife for 28 years and led his party from 2006 to 2007. Before his political career, Campbell was an accomplished sprinter who held the UK 100m record and competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. He was a respected voice in foreign affairs, notably as a critic of the Iraq war, and later became a member of the House of Lords in 2015.</p>

          <p>A submersible expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered that unexploded Nazi-era bombs, including V-1 cruise missiles, are now serving as thriving habitats for marine life. Scientists were astonished to find dense populations of animals, such as marine worms, crabs, and fish, covering the munitions on the seafloor. In a particularly unusual observation, over 40 starfish were found clustered on an exposed block of TNT, a highly toxic explosive. This phenomenon highlights nature's ability to adapt and utilize man-made objects, turning instruments of destruction into artificial reefs that support biodiversity in areas where natural hard surfaces have been removed.</p>

          <p>A coordinated sting operation by Interpol across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running extensive cybercrime networks. The operation targeted romance scams and 'sextortion' schemes, where criminals use social media and other digital platforms to defraud and blackmail victims. Authorities identified over 1,400 victims who collectively lost an estimated $2.8 million. The crackdown, which took place between July and August, led to the seizure of electronic devices and forged documents, dismantling 81 cybercrime groups. Officials noted a sharp increase in such digitally-enabled crimes, which cause significant financial and psychological harm to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions rise, particularly with the United States, Beijing has developed a range of policy tools to protect its domestic industries and retaliate against perceived unfair practices. Beyond standard anti-dumping investigations, China utilizes an "Unreliable Entity List" to target foreign companies deemed a threat to its national interests, imposing trade and investment restrictions. Another key measure involves strict export controls on dual-use items, which are goods that have both civilian and potential military applications. These policies allow China to exert significant economic leverage and respond forcefully to actions like the substantial import duties levied by the Trump administration, demonstrating a strategic and assertive trade posture.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is campaigning on a proposal to create a network of city-owned grocery stores aimed at providing low-cost food by operating without profit motives or rent expenses.

The concept of municipal grocery stores has a mixed record in the U.S., with some small towns like St. Paul, Kansas, finding success out of necessity, while others, such as nearby Erie, have failed due to consistent financial losses, highlighting the challenges of public-sector retail.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's remarks linking Tylenol to autism, medical professionals and researchers are emphasizing that no causal relationship has been established. The FDA and physician groups state that acetaminophen, Tylenol's active ingredient, remains the safest over-the-counter option for treating fever and pain during pregnancy. Experts, including authors of studies cited by the White House, clarify their research suggests caution with chronic use, not complete avoidance, especially since untreated high fevers pose significant risks to a fetus. The consensus is that pregnant individuals should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time needed and consult their doctor to weigh the risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>Jade Chang's latest novel, "What a Time to Be Alive," offers a sharp and humorous critique of modern wellness and influencer culture through its protagonist, Lola Treasure Gold. The story follows Lola's accidental rise to fame as a spiritual guru after a video of her pontificating at a friend's funeral goes viral. The book is praised for its propulsive narrative and psychologically complex main character, who embodies both sincerity and vapidity while navigating online fame, personal grief, and financial instability. The review highlights Chang's satirical take on the commodification of belief and the often-hollow nature of Instagram-fueled enlightenment, creating a compelling narrative about a uniquely contemporary Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is reportedly involved in high-level discussions to potentially lead a post-war transitional authority in Gaza. The proposal, said to have support from the White House, would establish a UN-backed governing body to stabilize the region for approximately five years before returning control to Palestinians. Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has been part of planning talks with U.S. officials. His office stated he would not support any plan that involved displacing Gaza's population. This development comes as various international parties continue to table different proposals for the future governance of the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is currently churning in the Atlantic, and forecasters are monitoring a nearby developing system for the possibility of a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones move close enough to each other to begin orbiting a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While officials say an interaction is unlikely in this case because the second storm is significantly weaker, the possibility exists. The 'dance' between two storms of comparable strength can be intense, but typically when one is weaker, it is simply absorbed by the larger, more powerful system without significantly increasing its strength.</p>

          <p>China has maintained a conspicuous silence following President Trump's announcement of a deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States. While Trump claimed to have received approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Chinese state media has not commented on the agreement, and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has not responded to inquiries. The deal's structure, which involves ByteDance retaining a minority stake in a new U.S.-based joint venture, still requires ultimate approval from Beijing. This lack of official response leaves the fate of the popular app uncertain, as the deal must navigate complex national security laws and trade relations between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The NFL is hosting a regular-season game in Dublin, Ireland, featuring the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings, an event with deep personal significance for the Steelers' founding Rooney family. The family's ancestors emigrated from County Down, Ireland, during the Great Famine in the 1840s before settling in Pennsylvania, where Art Rooney founded the team in 1933. His son, Dan Rooney, who later served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, was instrumental in fostering ties with the country and brought the first NFL game to Dublin in 1997. The game is seen as a celebration of the family's heritage and the strong connection between Ireland and the United States.</p>

The Argyle Street Ash, nominated as a wildcard entry, won the Woodland Trust competition, beating out other culturally significant trees, including an oak that may have inspired Virginia Woolf. The tree holds a special place in the local community, with stories of people meeting beneath its branches and its mention in a 1951 book. Its victory is being celebrated as a win for often-overlooked urban trees, and it will now represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year contest.</p>

          <p>The Welsh word 'poody,' meaning to sulk, is one of ten Welsh words added to the Oxford English Dictionary in its latest update. The term gained widespread recognition after contestants on the BBC show 'Race Across the World' used it, baffling the show's producers but resonating with viewers. The OED notes that 'poody' is a 'boomerang word,' having originated from the English 'pout,' been adopted into Welsh as 'pwdu,' and then re-borrowed back into English. Other Welsh words added include 'nobbling' (freezing cold) and 'diolch' (thank you), reflecting the evolving nature of the English language and its cultural borrowings.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, UK health officials are warning of a seasonal rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, urging the public to be aware of the distinct symptoms. While both viruses can cause fever and fatigue, the flu often arrives more suddenly with significant body aches, whereas COVID-19's symptom list has evolved to frequently include cold-like signs such as a runny nose and sore throat, with a hoarse voice being a hallmark of recent variants. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness from both viruses, and eligible groups are encouraged to get their seasonal shots to reduce hospitalizations and protect vulnerable populations.</p>
