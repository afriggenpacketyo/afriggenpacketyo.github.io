          <p>Veteran pop star Lulu, 76, has courageously revealed her nearly 12-year sobriety journey in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," candidly disclosing her past as a high-functioning alcoholic. She recounts hiding her drinking for decades, even while participating in "Strictly Come Dancing" in 2011, before finally seeking help in 2013 after a family conversation and committing to Alcoholics Anonymous. The article highlights her difficult childhood with an alcoholic father, which shaped her early life and her struggle to maintain a "squeaky clean" public image, ultimately leading to a liberating decision to share her truth in hopes of changing lives.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police announced a significant breakthrough in an 80-year-old cold case, stating that dismembered female body parts found in 1946 along the Willamette River are now believed to be those of "Oak Grove Jane Doe." This victim represents the state's oldest unidentified case, which went cold in the 1950s after crucial evidence was lost from law enforcement custody. The remains were recently rediscovered under a headstone reading "Unknown Woman 1946" at Mountain View Cemetery. Advanced forensic testing and analysis are currently underway, offering a renewed hope of finally restoring the victim's name and identity to history.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off during a Carabao Cup match after receiving a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration of his winning goal, having already received a yellow card. Manager Arne Slot publicly labeled the act as "stupid, not smart," emphasizing that it led to Ekitike's suspension for an upcoming Premier League game against Crystal Palace. The article notes Ekitike's subsequent apology on social media and highlights his otherwise excellent form since joining Liverpool for £69m. Despite the unnecessary dismissal, the player's importance to the team is underscored, and the incident is framed as a crucial learning experience for the young forward.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering and highly respected scholar of Chinese law and the founder of New York University's US-Asia Law Institute, has passed away at the age of 95. Beginning his career in 1960, Cohen was notably the first American to practice law in Communist China, and his extensive work profoundly shaped global discussions on China's legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades. His groundbreaking writings on Chinese criminal procedure and China's interactions with international law remain widely read and influential among legal scholars. The article highlights his unique reputation as both an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a consistent proponent of continued engagement with Beijing.</p>

          <p>California is advancing new legislation, Senate Bill 576, aimed at regulating the volume of streaming service commercials, a move inspired by a new mother whose sleeping newborn was frequently disturbed by overly loud ads. If signed by the governor, the bill would prohibit streaming services like Hulu, Netflix, and Prime Video from playing commercials at a louder volume than their accompanying programming. While existing federal law (the CALM Act) already covers broadcast, satellite, and cable TV, streaming services have historically been exempt. The article notes that the Motion Picture Association, initially opposed, changed its stance after an amendment removed the ability for private parties to sue.</p>

This intensified enforcement signals a broader, coordinated effort to boost local revenues and stabilize regional finances. The upcoming five-year plan is expected to outline comprehensive strategies to alleviate these pressing financial woes, which are critical for maintaining economic stability and ensuring the country's continued development trajectory.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are adopting a markedly more aggressive political strategy, heavily focusing their attacks on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, as underscored by Sir Ed Davey's recent punchy speech. This article suggests the party perceives a strategic opportunity to confront Reform and Donald Trump in ways that Labour and the Conservatives are either unwilling or unable to do. The Lib Dems hope the prospect of a Farage premiership will energize their activist base and boost donations, while also leveraging Reform's rise to demand more equitable media attention. Despite accusations of scaremongering, the party aims to appeal to disaffected Conservative voters and firmly position itself as a clear alternative in the evolving political landscape.</p>

In Nepal, these protests led to the prime minister's resignation after violent clashes resulted in dozens of deaths. While governments condemn the violence, they have also been compelled to acknowledge protesters' concerns and make some concessions, though the movement faces challenges in translating digital activism into sustained, fundamental social change due to its often leaderless nature.</p>

This achievement comes two years after the company's flagship Bud Light brand lost its top position following a widespread consumer boycott. The article notes that Modelo Especial, the previous leader, experienced sales declines partly attributed to stricter US immigration policies impacting Hispanic consumers. Anheuser-Busch credits Michelob Ultra's success to the launch of its non-alcoholic version and intensified marketing efforts.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney acknowledged this potential, hoping to retain talent that might otherwise seek opportunities in the US. The article highlights that previous US H-1B restrictions led multinational companies to increasingly hire in Canada. However, experts caution that Canada's immigration system presents its own challenges, including recent scaled-back immigration policies and generally lower average wages compared to the US, making its long-term appeal for permanent residency somewhat uncertain despite the current opportunity.
