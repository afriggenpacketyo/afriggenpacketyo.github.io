          <p>A new report indicates that family offices are intensifying their competition for skilled executives by implementing more structured and generous long-term incentive plans. These plans, now used by nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices, are boosting total compensation based on performance and investment returns. Median pay for CEOs at these firms has reached $825,000, with top executives at larger offices earning over $3 million annually. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities and carried interest, reflecting a shift from informal agreements to formalized, performance-driven compensation structures.

          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, despite a significant drop in profits compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's net income fell by 44% to $2.49 billion, but adjusted earnings per share beat estimates. Chevron anticipates its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation will start contributing to earnings by the fourth quarter and aims to cut annual costs by $1 billion by the end of 2025. Record second-quarter production output helped mitigate the financial impact of the decline in oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully doubled the service life of modern artillery gun barrels by adapting a 2,000-year-old anti-corrosion technique. The method is an advanced version of the chromium plating technology found on the remarkably preserved bronze swords of the Terracotta Army. This innovation addresses the severe erosion and microcracking caused by extreme heat and pressure during firing, a persistent challenge for high-velocity cannons. The upgraded technique provides a more resilient surface, significantly improving the longevity and reliability of crucial military hardware.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings declined by 23% to $7.1 billion compared to last year, but the results still surpassed Wall Street estimates. The company's performance was bolstered by strong production growth, particularly in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which helped offset the impact of a 10% year-over-year drop in oil prices. Exxon achieved its highest second-quarter production in over 25 years, pumping 4.6 million barrels per day. The oil major also returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and is on track with significant cost-cutting measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, founded in Detroit in 1903, has survived over a century of economic upheaval by staying true to its handcrafted, Arts and Crafts principles. While the city became a hub of mass production, Pewabic focused on unique, hand-thrown vessels and tiles with distinctive iridescent glazes, a process its founder called 'painting with fire.' Now operating as a nonprofit, the pottery continues to use its original 1912 equipment to create its products. In an age of AI and automation, Pewabic is experiencing renewed success, with 2024 being its best year ever, demonstrating a lasting appreciation for handmade goods.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has sold his final equity stake in Bridgewater Associates, the massive hedge fund he founded in 1975, and has stepped away from its board. This move completes a management transition that began in 2022, though Dalio will remain a significant investor in the firm's strategies and will continue to act as a mentor. Bridgewater raised capital from existing investors and employees to facilitate the final sale of Dalio's ownership. In a LinkedIn post, Dalio expressed his thrill at seeing the firm he built over 50 years positioned to be 'alive and well without me.'</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have announced new agreements focused on trade and the joint development of Pakistan's oil reserves, signaling a shift toward economic cooperation. President Trump revealed a deal for the U.S. to assist in developing what he termed Pakistan's 'massive oil reserves.' This was followed by a broader trade agreement and a lowering of the U.S. tariff rate on Pakistani imports to 19%. While the extent of Pakistan's oil reserves is debated, the move is seen as a strategic effort to attract investment, introduce new technology, and potentially counter China's growing economic influence in the region.</p>

The relocation, which cost around $20,000, was made possible by his wife obtaining a talent visa and his ability to work remotely for his U.S.-based company. Nellis has adjusted his schedule to work from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. local time to overlap with U.S. colleagues. The family hopes the move will provide a better work-life balance and a broader cultural foundation for their two young sons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning a five-year pilot program to cover popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy under Medicare and Medicaid. The proposal would allow state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover these GLP-1 medications for weight management purposes, a significant shift in federal policy. These drugs are highly effective but also very expensive, with costs raising concerns about affordability and the potential financial impact on public health systems. The initiative, slated to begin in 2026 for Medicaid and 2027 for Medicare, could expand access for millions of Americans.</p>

The collaboration will combine Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The project will initially focus on applications such as airborne surveillance and contested logistics, with testing set to begin this fall and operational demonstrations planned for 2026. The partnership aims to create a smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable alternative to traditional military aircraft like the Apache helicopter.</p>

While the current minimum age is 14, younger athletes can qualify by meeting exceptionally tough time standards. The executive director of World Aquatics acknowledged Yu's talent but stated officials must consider if allowing such young athletes to compete is appropriate and whether new 'guardrails' are needed.</p>

          <p>A contributor for the Los Angeles Times argues that the new sequel, 'Happy Gilmore 2,' continues the original film's underlying conservative message about the primacy of family. The article posits that protagonist Happy Gilmore's motivations in both films are purely altruistic, playing golf not for personal glory but to provide for his grandmother and, in the sequel, his daughter. The author suggests that Adam Sandler, who casts his own wife and daughter in the new film, is conveying a traditional message that a meaningful life is one of service to family. This contrasts with the character's rebellious, foul-mouthed persona.</p>
