This initiative is part of a broader government effort focused on predicting and preventing illnesses, which includes a ¬£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The scheme follows a prior announcement of a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies.</p>

          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana following a federal judge's order. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil, a green card holder, was not a threat to the community or a flight risk, criticizing his detention as "highly unusual." Khalil had been in custody for months due to "foreign policy" concerns raised by the Trump administration. Upon his release, Khalil expressed gratitude and criticized the administration's actions, while officials stated their intent to appeal the decision and continue efforts to remove him from the United States.</p>

          <p>Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who played a role in the Columbia University protests against Israel's war in Gaza, has been released from federal immigration jail in Louisiana. He spent 104 days in US custody and said that justice prevailed, but it's very long overdue. The Trump administration has targeted Khalil, saying he played a role in antisemitic protests. Khalil's green card will be returned to him, and he is permitted to limited travel within the US.</p>
