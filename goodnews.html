          <p>One of the Big Bear bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow's two eaglets, Sunny, has successfully taken its first flight from the nest. The eaglets, born in March, are now nearly 13 weeks old, which is the prime time for fledging. Sunny's flight was the culmination of days of practice, and it is anticipated that she will return to the nest relatively soon. Gizmo, the other eaglet, has not yet left the nest, as she is developing at a slower pace than Sunny. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This policy change provides older borrowers with more time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. The administration cited its commitment to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on fixed incomes, as the reason for the pause. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits. </p>
