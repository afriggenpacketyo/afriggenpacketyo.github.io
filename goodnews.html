          <p>An infant named KJ Muldoon became the first patient in the world to undergo a personalized gene-editing treatment using CRISPR technology to correct a rare genetic disorder, severe Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1). Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia administered three infusions of the experimental therapy to KJ's liver, targeting the uniquely mutated gene among 20,000 in his body. The treatment has shown no serious side effects so far, and KJ is gaining weight and thriving. This groundbreaking approach offers hope for treating other rare genetic disorders and represents a significant step forward in personalized medicine.</p>
