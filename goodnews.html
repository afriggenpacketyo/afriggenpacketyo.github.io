        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted that struggling competitor Spirit Airlines is headed for bankruptcy, declaring that the ultra-discount airline business model is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby stated that a business model predicated on low base fares and numerous extra fees alienates customers and is unsustainable. Spirit Airlines, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year, has been cutting destinations amid weak demand and high costs. Spirit responded on social media, suggesting Kirby's focus on them is evidence that their low-fare options remain popular.</p>

          <p>Stock prices for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw significant increases following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a takeover offer for its rival. A potential deal would merge major media assets, including CNN, HBO, and the CBS network, further consolidating an industry already reshaped by the streaming era. The bid is being led by David Ellison, whose firm recently completed its own merger with Paramount. While no formal offer has been submitted, the market speculation alone was enough to boost Warner Bros. Discovery shares by 29% and Paramount Skydance by 16%.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her conviction in a major bribery case. She was found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for her husband's political influence. Her defense had requested a lighter sentence due to her ongoing cancer treatment, but the judge, while sentencing below the guidelines, noted she was a "central participant" in the scheme. At her sentencing, she expressed remorse and took accountability, stating, "I was wrong about my husband," who is currently serving his own 11-year sentence.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Toronto International Film Festival featured several potential awards contenders, including two competing biopics about professional fighters from the 1990s. "The Smashing Machine" stars Dwayne Johnson as MMA fighter Mark Kerr, while "Christy" features Sydney Sweeney as boxer Christy Martin, with both films exploring the athletes' struggles. Other notable films included Nia DaCosta's dynamic "Hedda," a modern adaptation of "Hedda Gabler" starring Tessa Thompson, and Guillermo del Toro's grisly but faithful adaptation of "Frankenstein." The festival also saw the premiere of Baz Luhrmann's "EPiC," a concert film constructed from unseen footage of Elvis Presley's Las Vegas performances.</p>

          <p>Adobe's stock gained in after-hours trading after the software company announced fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations. The company reported adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on revenue of $5.99 billion, showing an 11% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. Adobe also provided an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fourth quarter, with earnings and revenue guidance exceeding consensus estimates. The positive report and strong outlook for its digital media business signal robust performance for the design software maker, despite its stock underperforming the broader tech market this year.</p>

          <p>A Scottish couple has finally solved the mystery of a stranger who appeared in their wedding photos from four years ago. Michelle and John Wylie were baffled by the man's presence at their 2021 wedding, as no family, friends, or staff could identify him. After a recent appeal to an internet content creator went viral, the man, Andrew Hillhouse, came forward. He explained that he had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after being given the incorrect venue by his partner, only realizing his mistake when the bride he didn't recognize walked down the aisle. He stayed through the ceremony to avoid causing a scene before quietly leaving.</p>

          <p>In an internal meeting, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted that the company's leadership needs to "do better" in rebuilding trust with its employees. The comments came in response to an employee question about a perceived lack of empathy following recent layoffs and a new mandate requiring workers to return to the office three days a week. Nadella acknowledged that new and remote employees may not feel a sense of mentorship and that the company faces hard work ahead to renew its culture. The internal challenges contrast with the company's strong financial performance, with its stock up nearly 20% this year.</p>

He addressed concerns that recent U.S. trade rhetoric and tariffs have strained the relationship with the key Indo-Pacific partner. Gor asserted that the relationship remains "much warmer" despite minor "hiccups" and that India and China have little in common, making closer ties between them unlikely.</p>

The merger would also consolidate significant sports broadcasting rights, including Paramount's new UFC deal and WBD's contracts with the NHL and MLB.

          <p>The latest inflation report showing a rise to 2.9% in August has renewed focus on investment strategies that can hedge against rising prices. This article suggests that gold can be a valuable asset in this economic climate, as it tends to maintain its value or even increase in price when inflation erodes the purchasing power of currency. Gold recently surpassed a record price of $3,600 per ounce, reflecting its appeal as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. While advocating for its inclusion in a diversified portfolio, the article also cautions investors to limit their gold allocation to a maximum of 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company engages in systemic discrimination against riders with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The complaint claims that Uber drivers routinely refuse service to individuals who use service animals or stowable wheelchairs and sometimes impose improper fees or engage in demeaning behavior. The DOJ is seeking a jury trial, monetary damages, and a court order to compel Uber to modify its policies to ensure equal access for all riders. Uber has stated it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their decline, reaching their lowest levels in almost a year and potentially creating an opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The average rate for a 30-year term is now 6.35%, a significant drop from over 7% earlier in the year. This decrease is largely attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential borrowers to weigh the risks of waiting for even lower rates against the possibility that the current favorable trend could reverse, as has happened in the past.

After the initial investment is paid back, the profit split will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan.

          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over whether school reading lists should be updated to include more contemporary and diverse authors, rather than focusing heavily on classics like Goethe. Critics point out that required reading lists are dominated by white male authors, failing to reflect the multicultural reality of modern Germany, where over 25% of the population has an immigrant background. Students have expressed a desire for literature that is more relevant to their own lives and experiences. While some educators are making efforts to modernize curriculums, others argue for the importance of classics in understanding history.</p>
