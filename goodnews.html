          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, marking a significant shift in relations. Trump praised al-Sharaa's strength and past, urging him to normalize ties with Israel, deport Palestinian terrorists, and prevent the resurgence of ISIS. Al-Sharaa expressed hope for Syria's role in facilitating trade and invited American investment in Syrian oil and gas. The meeting, also attended by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signals a potential realignment in the region, though key U.S. ally Israel remains wary.</p>

          <p>Customs and Border Protection officers in Southern California seized approximately 150,000 illegally imported cigarettes from two cruise ship passengers arriving from Ensenada, Mexico. The cigarettes, valued at nearly $60,000, were discovered in 749 cartons across 10 pieces of luggage. Despite providing purchase receipts, the women were unable to produce permits for transporting such a large quantity of tobacco products. CBP officials emphasized the commitment to enforcing import laws and protecting the American public, noting that selling illegally imported cigarettes could yield high profits for underground vendors while evading taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustration with demeaning portrayals of Chinese people in early Hollywood films led to the creation of the Great Wall Film Company in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Financed by Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do, the studio aimed to counter stereotypes and provide a more authentic representation of the Chinese community. The studio, located in Gravesend, produced films distributed in the U.S. and China, reflecting a "do-it-yourself" mentality within Chinese-American communities. Though short-lived due to the Great Depression, the Lee family's legacy continued with the New York Chinese Film Exchange, showcasing Chinese movies and fostering cultural connection.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest forward Taiwo Awoniyi has regained consciousness after undergoing surgery to repair a serious abdominal injury sustained during a match against Leicester City. Awoniyi was placed in an induced coma following the initial surgery to allow medical staff to monitor his progress. The club is set to conduct an internal review of the incident, as Awoniyi remained on the field despite showing signs of discomfort after the collision with a goalpost.</p>
