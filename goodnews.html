        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng are experiencing a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains as the company introduces new models and progresses toward profitability. Xpeng's Hong Kong shares jumped following strong earnings and a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter, driven by robust sales that quadrupled year-over-year. This improved performance has narrowed the company's net loss and boosted its gross margin, leading analysts to anticipate Xpeng will break even in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve a turnaround by early 2026. The brokerage maintains a buy rating on the stock and pegs target price at 150 Hong Kong dollars ‚Äî over 76% upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers mounted a remarkable comeback, overcoming a double-digit fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers and Tyrese Haliburton's near buzzer-beater highlighted the Pacers' late-game surge, while Jalen Brunson's 43 points for the Knicks were not enough to secure the win. This series is a rematch of the second round last year, which Indiana won in seven games against an injury-riddled Knicks squad, but it's also who the Knicks faced in both the 1999 and 2000 Eastern Conference Finals ‚Äì the teams split both of those series. The Knicks will look to rebound in Game 2 at Madison Square Garden.</p>

          <p>Thursday's UK newspaper front pages are dominated by the government's partial reversal on winter fuel payments and Donald Trump's contentious meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The winter fuel U-turn, prompted by local election losses and pressure from Labour MPs, is viewed as a significant climbdown for Prime Minister Starmer. Trump's meeting with Ramaphosa, marked by accusations of white farmer persecution, is also a major focus, with several papers highlighting the unusual presentation of a video and news clippings during the discussion. Several newspapers also highlighted Tottenham overcoming a 17-year drought to win the Europa League.</p>

          <p>Canada is engaged in high-level discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense program. Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed these talks, emphasizing the growing missile threats, including those from space. While cautious, Carney acknowledged the potential benefits of joining the program to protect Canadians. These discussions occur amid complex US-Canada relations and Canada's efforts to diversify its trade and security alliances, and Trump has suggested that it should be the 51st US state.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revised gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers, ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The government subsidy aims to reduce the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, a targeted 5 yen effective decrease from a week earlier when crude price fluctuations are taken into account. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent agreed that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals during bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement indicates that the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in the tariff talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the global economy and emphasized the inappropriateness of using tariffs to address trade imbalances.
