          <p>The 2025 Belmont Stakes features a rematch of the top three Kentucky Derby finishers, Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza, highlighting the competition at Saratoga Race Course. Journalism, the Preakness winner, enters as the morning-line favorite, while Sovereignty aims to replicate its Derby success. The race distance is shortened to 1 1/4 miles due to the temporary venue change. Several trainers and jockeys bring prior Belmont experiences, adding intrigue to the Triple Crown's final jewel, as none of the horses this year will win the Triple Crown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of imposing time limits on federal rental assistance, examining a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and save money. The Delaware program offers incentives like interest-bearing savings accounts to help people transition off subsidies. While some argue that time limits encourage self-sufficiency and turnover, others worry about the potential for increased homelessness, citing a failed experiment in Washington state. The article suggests that additional support, such as savings programs and assistance with budgeting, is crucial for the success of time-limited rental aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the liquor industry as their preferences shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, a town known for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to meet the demand for low-alcohol wines. Liquor brands are innovating to appeal to younger consumers, focusing on self-indulgent experiences rather than social rituals. This shift marks a significant change in China's alcohol market, where baijiu has long been the dominant choice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report reveals that fees on forgotten 401(k) accounts can cost workers thousands of dollars in lost retirement savings. Former employees who leave their 401(k)s with their previous employers may be charged additional maintenance fees that erode their principal and reduce potential compound growth. While rolling over funds into an IRA may seem like a solution, IRAs often have higher investment fees. The Department of Labor has created a retirement savings lost and found database to help workers locate old retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the controversy surrounding President Trump's plan to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on the Army's birthday. While some critics view the parade as an authoritarian display of power, the author argues that it could be a patriotic celebration and an opportunity to counter misperceptions about the military. The parade could also help address the military's shrinking recruitment numbers by bringing Americans closer to service members. The author acknowledges the risk that Trump may use the event for political purposes but suggests the military should focus on honoring the troops.</p>
