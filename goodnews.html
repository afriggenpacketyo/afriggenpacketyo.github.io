          <h2>Nike to Resume Direct Sales on Amazon After Counterfeit Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly on Amazon in the U.S. after a six-year hiatus, aiming to enhance customer experience and control distribution. The company initially stopped selling wholesale on Amazon due to counterfeit concerns. This move benefits Amazon, which seeks to attract more high-end brands. The limited selection of Nike products previously available on Amazon was sold by third-party sellers, but Nike was a "gated" brand on Amazon, meaning it was highly restricted to prevent counterfeit and low-quality items.</p>
