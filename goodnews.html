          <p>Shares of the financial technology company Block surged after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index, where it will replace Hess. This move is expected to drive significant demand for the stock, as passive index funds will need to purchase an estimated 101 million shares to align their holdings with the updated index. The inclusion comes as Block works to rebuild investor confidence following inconsistent performance from its Cash App business. The article notes that despite a recent strong market run, competing fintech firm Robinhood has not yet been added to the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking a $20,000 loan, home equity products offer a potentially cheaper alternative to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. This article compares a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) and a standard home equity loan, noting that their average interest rates are nearly identical at present. However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change, while home equity loan rates are fixed, providing more predictability for borrowers. The analysis shows that while a HELOC is marginally cheaper now, even a small rate increase could make it more expensive over the life of the loan, urging caution for homeowners using their property as collateral.

          <h2>Key Considerations for Investing in Short-Term CDs in July 2025</h2>

          <p>This article outlines three important factors for individuals considering placing a large sum, such as $20,000, into a short-term certificate of deposit (CD). It notes that short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than long-term ones, providing protection against market volatility amid concerns about inflation and economic policy. However, savers aiming for maximum interest over time might still earn more with a lower-rate, long-term CD due to the extended earning period. Finally, the article advises that the most competitive CD rates are often found at online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional local bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, a specialized provider of data centers for artificial intelligence, announced its intention to sell $1.5 billion in bonds due in 2031. The company, whose major clients include Nvidia and Microsoft, stated that the capital raised will be used for general corporate purposes, including paying down existing debt. This move follows a previous $2 billion debt offering in May that was heavily oversubscribed and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. CoreWeave's stock has more than tripled since its public debut in March, though some investors have expressed concerns about its debt levels.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of approximately 700 active-duty Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration policies. The deployment was a rare instance of using active-duty troops on U.S. soil for domestic issues and was done alongside the federalization of the California National Guard, a move opposed by the state's governor. A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the redeployment was directed as stability has returned to the city. About 2,000 National Guard members will remain in the area to protect federal property and personnel as law enforcement activities continue.</p>

          <p>Four months after acquiring the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion, PepsiCo has announced it will launch its own version, Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, this fall. The new beverage aims to capture health-conscious consumers interested in gut health, a market that has fueled the rapid growth of brands like Poppi and Olipop. This move is part of PepsiCo's strategy to innovate and counter declining soda consumption in the U.S., where its North American beverage volume recently shrank by 2%. The new cola will contain three grams of prebiotic fiber and will be sweetened with cane sugar instead of the high-fructose corn syrup used in classic Pepsi.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Benefits of a Reverse Mortgage for Seniors in July 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:17:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines why a reverse mortgage can be a particularly timely financial tool for senior homeowners aged 62 and older. It explains that a reverse mortgage allows seniors to receive payments from their home equity without the burden of immediate repayment, which is advantageous in the current high-interest-rate climate. These funds can supplement income, filling gaps left by Social Security or covering rising costs due to inflation. Furthermore, qualifying for a reverse mortgage may be easier than for other large loans, as it is based on home equity rather than stringent credit or income requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has successfully signed winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal worth an initial £65 million. The 25-year-old Cameroon international has signed a five-year contract, calling the move an opportunity to join his "dream club." The transfer concludes a lengthy negotiation process, with United's third offer finally being accepted after previous bids were rejected. Mbeumo was a key player for Brentford, scoring 20 goals last season, and his sale marks the club's largest ever. The signing is a significant acquisition for United as they reinforce their squad under manager Ruben Amorim ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>This article details the three primary requirements for individuals looking to enroll in a debt management program to handle unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans. First, applicants must have a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new consolidated monthly payment. Second, the total amount of unsecured debt must fall within the program's limits, as these plans are not designed for very small or extremely large debt loads. Finally, a person must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which typically include closing the credit accounts in the plan and participating in financial counseling.
