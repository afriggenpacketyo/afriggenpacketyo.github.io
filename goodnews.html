        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has successfully launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to significantly reduce energy consumption. The 1,300-tonne data cabin, submerged 35 meters deep, utilizes the surrounding seawater for natural cooling, which lowers operational costs compared to traditional land-based facilities. This initial phase is part of a larger provincial plan to build a subsea data center with 100 cabins, positioning it as a key component of Hainan's strategy to develop new technologies for the blue economy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 03:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unique art exhibition is creating a dialogue between artifacts recovered from a Tang dynasty shipwreck and Western art, particularly the works of Impressionist painter Claude Monet. The display juxtaposes ancient Chinese ceramics and a replica sailboat with Monet's paintings of merchant ships, exploring the universal theme of maritime culture as a vessel for global exchange. The curator was inspired by the idea that both trade goods and art transcend borders, traveling across the world to share their stories and inspire diverse audiences. This convergence highlights the timeless and borderless nature of cultural connection.</p>

          <p>Two years after becoming the first player to move from the Women's Super League to the Saudi Women's Premier League, Nigerian international Ashleigh Plumptre is reflecting on her decision. While she aims to challenge Western preconceptions about life for female athletes in Saudi Arabia, she admits regret over hurting and losing the trust of some LGBT fans due to the country's laws against same-sex relations. Plumptre, who recently signed a contract extension with Al-Ittihad, acknowledges the league has significant room for growth but also reports feeling safer living in Jeddah than in the UK.</p>

          <h2>World Bank Increases China's 2025 Growth Forecast to 4.8% Amid Ongoing Trade Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 02:05:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has revised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China upward to 4.8%, a notable increase from its previous 4% prediction, citing the positive effects of government stimulus measures. This optimistic adjustment comes despite escalating trade tensions with the United States, which have resulted in significant tariff increases on Chinese imports. However, the bank anticipates this growth momentum may slow to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus effects fade and persistent domestic challenges, such as the real estate slump and weak consumer spending, continue to weigh on the economy.

          <h2>Chinese Electric Vehicle Maker BYD Reports 880% Sales Surge in the UK</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese automotive giant BYD has announced that the United Kingdom is now its largest market outside of China, following a remarkable 880% year-over-year sales increase in September. The company sold over 11,000 cars in the UK last month, with its Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV leading the charge and boosting its market share to 3.6%. This success is attributed to the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, unlike the EU and the US, making it an attractive market for brands offering more affordable models than many Western competitors.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, pine martens have been released into Exmoor National Park as part of a significant conservation effort. A group of 19 of the cat-sized mammals, relocated from populations in Scotland, were introduced at undisclosed locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and adaptation to the new environment. Conservationists from the Two Moors Pine Marten Project hailed the reintroduction as a positive step for restoring the region's woodland ecosystems, where the native species once played a critical balancing role.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a crucial seventh-inning rally to secure a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies starter Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 consecutive batters, the Dodgers' offense came alive with a series of smart at-bats and aggressive baserunning. The four-run inning, capped by key two-out RBI singles from Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani, silenced the Philadelphia crowd and pushed the Phillies to the brink of elimination.</p>

          <p>Chi-Chi's, the Minnesota-founded Mexican restaurant chain that closed its U.S. locations two decades ago, has officially made its return with a new restaurant in St. Louis Park. The reopening was highly anticipated, with reservations for the first day being fully booked and dedicated fans traveling from as far as Ohio to be among the first customers. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which has owned the Chi-Chi's trademark since 1987, allowing for the brand's return to physical restaurant locations.</p>

          <p>The European Union has weighed in on the dispute over United Nations Resolution 2758, stating that the 1971 document only addressed the issue of China's representation and does not mention Taiwan. This clarification supports the position of Taiwan and the U.S., countering Beijing's narrative that the resolution provides an international legal basis for its sovereignty claims over the island. The EU spokesperson emphasized that the resolution simply switched representation from Taipei to Beijing, and called on China to uphold the UN Charter, including the prohibition on the use of force.</p>
