          <h2>Declassified Memo Undermines Trump's Rationale for Deporting Venezuelans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 20:58:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang. This claim was used to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. The release of the memo further weakens the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act, a law previously used only during declared wars, and raises questions about the Justice Department's investigation into media coverage of the issue.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must be included in the final count, effectively securing a victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers stated that removing votes six months after Election Day would violate the due process and equal protection rights of affected residents. He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. Griffin has been granted seven days to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, after six decades of investment success, is retiring as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era. Buffett stood out on Wall Street by eschewing chicanery and focusing on the long term, treating his duty to shareholders as a sacred trust. His most distinguishing mark was his unwavering focus on the long term, ignoring momentary fashions and short-term distractions. Buffett's coups were based on his evaluation of publicly reported data, requiring courage and personal responsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is testing the limits of New York City campaign finance rules by allegedly using his campaign website to instruct a super PAC, Fix the City, on how to support his mayoral bid, a practice known as red-boxing. This involves posting strategic information in a public location where big money groups can access it, circumventing rules that prohibit direct communication between campaigns and super PACs. If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose millions in public matching funds. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has issued a warning about the new rules, but it remains unclear if they are scrutinizing Cuomo‚Äôs tactics.</p>

The nonprofit will be OpenAI‚Äôs largest shareholder, and the company has notably backtracked from its plan to shift control away from the nonprofit.

The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos created using artificial intelligence, and hosted forums where users could buy and sell custom nonconsensual content. The shutdown comes after Congress passed the "Take It Down Act," which makes it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. Experts see the shutdown as a step in the right direction, but acknowledge that the issue of nonconsensual deepfake imagery will persist.</p>
