          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is reportedly stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago. The company's aircraft production and deliveries have increased, and analysts anticipate it will post its first annual profit since 2018 next year, boosting investor confidence. Despite these positive signs, including improved relationships with major airline customers, Boeing still faces significant challenges. Ongoing issues include FAA production caps on the 737 Max, certification delays for new models, and persistent problems within its defense unit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in his capacity as the head of the ASEAN regional bloc. The conflict, which flared after a landmine explosion, had escalated with both nations blaming each other and recalling their ambassadors. The ceasefire is seen as a crucial first step toward de-escalation and restoring peaceful relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores why 94-year-old media mogul Rupert Murdoch is confronting President Trump, a figure his Fox News channel has often supported. The Wall Street Journal, owned by Murdoch, published a story about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to a $10 billion lawsuit from the president. While other media outlets have reportedly yielded to pressure from the Trump administration, Murdoch appears determined to defend his newspaper's reporting. The author speculates on Murdoch's motives, suggesting they could range from business strategy to a personal vendetta or a final, complex act to protect press freedom.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the challenge of making "hard choices," such as choosing between a high-paying corporate job and a lower-paying but morally fulfilling nonprofit career. Drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang, the article argues that such choices are difficult not because one option is secretly better, but because the alternatives are "on a par." Instead of searching for an objectively correct answer, individuals must use their own agency to create reasons for their choice, thereby defining who they want to become. This act of choosing is presented as a fundamental and powerful aspect of human freedom.</p>

          <p>Nash Keen, a baby from Iowa, has been officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's most premature baby to survive after being born at just 21 weeks gestation. He weighed only 10 ounces at birth and faced enormous medical challenges, spending 198 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. His survival defied steep odds, as doctors initially gave him virtually no chance of making it. Now celebrating his first birthday, Nash continues to overcome developmental delays with ongoing therapy, serving as a source of hope and a testament to advances in neonatal care.</p>

          <p>Stargazers are being encouraged to look for meteors this week, as two lesser-known showers, the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids, are set to peak. Unlike the more famous Perseid meteor shower in August, which will be obscured by a bright moon this year, this week’s events will occur with the moon only a quarter full, providing better viewing conditions. Together, the two showers could produce up to 30 meteors per hour. Astronomers advise finding a dark location away from city lights after midnight for the best chance to see the celestial display.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is initiating the first phase of a major redevelopment project for the historic, 93-year-old General Hospital building. A development team has received authorization for $120 million to begin remediation and upgrades, preparing the iconic but dilapidated structure for a new life. The ambitious long-term vision aims to transform the 19-story building and its surrounding campus into a vibrant, health-oriented community.

          <p>In a recent interview, "Jeopardy!" host and trivia champion Ken Jennings discusses his new book and his philosophy on knowledge. He argues that trivia is not merely about recalling random facts but is a social good that fosters cultural literacy and connects people. Jennings laments the decline of generalists in a society of specialists and emphasizes that learning should be a fun, narrative-driven adventure. He also expresses serious concerns about the rise of AI, fearing it could create an over-reliance on technology while simultaneously delivering biased or counterfactual information controlled by a select few.</p>

          <p>A new true-crime book, "The Carpool Detectives," details the story of four Los Angeles mothers who, with no law enforcement training, solved a decades-old double homicide. The women—a former forensic accountant, a book researcher, a project manager, and a research executive—banded together during the pandemic to investigate the cold case. After two and a half years of navigating dead ends and working with reluctant officials, they successfully identified the perpetrator. The book, written by Chuck Hogan, chronicles their unlikely journey, which has reportedly "revolutionized" their lives and led them to tackle a new case.</p>

The zoo expressed it was "over the moon" with the development, which is a positive step for the conservation of red pandas.

          <p>Minnesota has enacted a new law that will require social media platforms to display a pop-up warning label to users starting in July 2026. The label, the first of its kind in the U.S., will inform users that prolonged use can be hazardous to their mental health, linking to issues like depression and anxiety. The measure aims to encourage more thoughtful online engagement, particularly among young people. Tech industry groups like NetChoice oppose the law, arguing it compels private companies to carry the state's message, and have indicated they may challenge it in court.</p>

          <p>Psychologists are recognizing that not all children respond to ultra-processed foods in the same way, with some having a naturally stronger "food reward drive." These children feel more motivated to eat and struggle to feel full, making them vulnerable in an environment with hyper-palatable foods. Experts suggest that standard advice may not work for these kids and recommend specific strategies for parents. Instead of keeping such foods at home and trying to regulate intake, they advise keeping the home environment largely free of ultra-processed items while allowing them in moderation outside the home.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg warned that the Democratic party's goal should not be to simply restore the institutions and norms that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that the pre-2024 status quo was already failing many Americans, which contributed to the party's defeat. Buttigieg stated that while it is wrong for the current administration to dismantle federal departments, it is also a mistake to believe those institutions were perfect. He advocated for a forward-looking approach that embraces change rather than trying to "tape the pieces together" of a broken system.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has added fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton to its squad for the final and decisive Test match against India at The Oval. The move is intended to provide cover and fresh energy for the team's pace attack, which was described as exhausted after spending 143 overs in the field during the drawn fourth Test. With a tight turnaround before the final match begins, key bowlers have played extensively, and captain Ben Stokes has been nursing injuries. Overton, who has one previous Test cap, joins other pace options as England looks to secure a series victory.</p>
