        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney underwent a dramatic physical transformation for her role as legendary boxer Christy Martin in the upcoming film "Christy," gaining over 30 pounds. Her preparation involved rigorous three-times-daily training with boxing and weight coaches, alongside a specialized diet that notably included frequent Chick-fil-A meals and milkshakes. Sweeney expressed feeling profoundly stronger and deeply inspired by embodying such a powerful woman, while Martin herself lauded Sweeney's accurate portrayal of both her bombastic boxing persona and her reserved private self. The film, which delves into Martin's challenging life, including a domestic violence survival story, garnered a standing ovation at TIFF and is already generating significant Oscar buzz for Sweeney's compelling performance.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, where they addressed the growing threat of oligarchic control in the US. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist backed by progressives, condemned CUNY's dismissal of anti-war Palestinian solidarity professors and vowed to freeze rents, increase housing, and raise taxes for the wealthiest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" against powerful billionaires and criticized mainstream Democrats for their lack of support. The event underscored a broader fight for the Democratic Party's future and the need to mobilize against concentrated wealth and political influence.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans delivered a resounding 59-20 victory over Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern, showcasing an explosive offense that amassed 755 yards, their most in two decades. Junior quarterback Jayden Maiava was exceptional, throwing four touchdowns and shattering his career high with 412 passing yards before the fourth quarter. Despite a sloppy start with an early fumble and defensive breakdowns, USC's powerful rushing attack, led by Waymond Jordan's 167 yards, overwhelmed the Eagles. The win provided a cathartic moment for USC fans against their former coach, highlighting the team's offensive prowess under Lincoln Riley.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots using bubble-popping energy, detailed in the journal Science. The technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form vapor bubbles. The sudden collapse of these bubbles, a process known as cavitation, releases a strong force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. By precisely controlling the light flow, scientists can manipulate the launch and even enable the small materials to swim, showcasing an efficient new launching mechanism.</p>

          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states are adopting Yondr locked magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, impacting millions of students. The system, which requires students to place their phones in a pouch that is unlocked by magnets at designated school areas, aims to reduce distractions and foster greater student engagement. While some students welcome the change, others are devising ways to circumvent the restrictions, and the cost of the pouches has sparked debate over school budget allocation. Educators and parents, however, report early positive changes, including increased communication and a more focused learning environment.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to shed its "one-man-band" image and expand its electoral footprint by promoting new candidates and recruiting more members. At its recent conference, the party showcased hopefuls like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives disillusioned with the party. Leader Nigel Farage emphasized the need for 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections, including mayoral polls in London, Wales, and Scotland, calling it an "essential building block" for a general election. The party insists it has improved its rigorous vetting system to avoid past scandals and build a "people's army."</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who served in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who have performed dangerous front-line roles in the military. She co-founded Sisters in Service, a community interest company that supports female military veterans working in healthcare, noting that women often face additional challenges due to misconceptions about their service. Bennett emphasizes that many people hold an "outdated idea" that only men deploy to the front line, despite women's crucial roles in modern conflicts. The group provides a "cathartic" network for women to share experiences, offering a vital community that traditional veteran spaces may not fully provide.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with his canonization ceremony presided over by Pope Leo on Sunday. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis, who died of leukemia at 15, created websites documenting miracles to spread Catholic teachings. His canonization was fast-tracked after Pope Francis attributed two miracles to him, with his body now preserved in wax in Assisi, Italy. Our Lady of Dolours Church in Chelsea, where he was baptized, has become another pilgrimage site, featuring a shrine with a strand of his hair. Young Catholics, like Diego Sarkissian, feel a strong connection to Acutis, seeing him as a relatable figure who played video games and wore jeans.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) starting October 12, affecting non-EU citizens traveling to the Schengen Area. This system, designed to enhance security and streamline travel, will replace manual passport stamping by digitally tracking entries and exits across 29 European countries. For first-time users, the process involves registering biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo, at kiosks or with border officers. Concerns remain about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy points like Dover, though Eurostar plans a phased rollout to mitigate disruptions.</p>
