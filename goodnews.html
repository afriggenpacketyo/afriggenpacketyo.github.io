          <h2>Chinese Exports Decline Amid U.S. Tariffs, Shifting Trade Patterns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 16:55:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to tariffs imposed by the U.S., making it more expensive for American retailers to import goods from China. In response, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries have surged, indicating a shift in trade patterns. Despite President Trump suggesting a potential reduction in tariffs, businesses remain cautious, and retailers are rethinking their supply chains to reduce reliance on China. Analysts anticipate that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will eventually settle around 34% as both sides engage in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has directed military leaders to remove and review library materials related to diversity, anti-racism, and gender issues within two weeks. This order is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion content from federal agencies. Military leaders are required to identify and sequester materials potentially incompatible with the core mission, using terms like "affirmative action," "gender identity," and "white privilege" to aid in the review.

          <p>Financial expert Ric Edelman argues that the traditional 60-40 investment portfolio is no longer viable due to increased longevity and breakthroughs in health and science. Edelman suggests that investors planning for the long term should allocate a higher percentage of their portfolio to equities, recommending 70% to 80% to ensure they do not outlive their savings. He emphasizes that people are living longer than ever before, and financial planning models should assume individuals will live to 100.</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, HELOCs can be a valuable financing source, but paying them back strategically is crucial. Homeowners should consider taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, monitoring the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and using the HELOC for select home repairs and renovations to potentially benefit from tax deductions. Understanding early payment penalties and consulting with a lending expert can help create a personalized repayment strategy.</p>
