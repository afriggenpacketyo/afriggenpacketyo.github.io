          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system, with 50.4% in favor. This was the second vote on the matter, after a 2021 proposal was rejected over privacy concerns related to data being held by private companies. The newly approved system will be state-controlled, with data stored exclusively on users' smartphones, and citizens can continue to use traditional ID cards. Supporters argue it will streamline online services, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy risks.</p>

          <p>In a public referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. The measure, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered devices within the city. The use of electric models will be permitted only from October to December, with special permission required at other times of the year. Supporters argued the devices are disruptive and harmful to microorganisms, while opponents criticized the move as an example of an overly restrictive "culture of prohibition."</p>

          <h2>Alternative Data Sources Suggest a Complex Inflation Picture Amid Official Skepticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid public skepticism about official government statistics, alternative data sources are providing a more nuanced view of inflation. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) has faced criticism for potentially outdated methodology, independent indexes from sources like Truflation, Adobe, and Zillow suggest consumer price increases may be lower than reported. However, leading indicators from business groups like the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) show that prices paid by businesses are rising, suggesting future inflationary pressure. These alternative metrics offer a more comprehensive, real-time look at economic trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 10:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is implementing a new industrial manufacturing model, known as a "pull system," to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach contrasts with the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. In the new model, final assembly lines pull components from suppliers only when needed, aiming for higher quality, lower costs, and greater flexibility. The strategy is designed to help China dominate the rapidly growing global space industry.</p>

          <h2>Rising Mall Vacancies Create Opportunities for Small Businesses to Secure Prime Real Estate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 09:59:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate. Landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied. This trend is allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and other service-based businesses to move into spaces they were previously priced out of. While the opportunities vary by location, the shift is enabling a new mix of local tenants to revitalize once-exclusive retail corridors.</p>
