          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" due to its excessive length and florid detail. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday criticized the filing for violating federal rules requiring concise allegations, citing superfluous references to Trump's properties and media appearances. The judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended, shorter complaint, limited to 40 pages. A spokesperson for Trump's legal team has vowed to continue pursuing the lawsuit against the newspaper.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, but a final agreement was not reached during their recent phone call, according to a White House official. Trump later commented that a deal is "well on its way" and could be a formality. This development comes after Trump extended the deadline for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations to December 16. The proposed deal framework aims to address national security concerns over American user data while allowing the popular video-sharing app to continue operating in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK have proposed a new policy to establish police counters in public venues such as supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would enhance public confidence in policing and make it easier for citizens to report crimes and share information. To fund the initiative, the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, which they claim would free up over £100 million. This policy announcement comes as the party begins its annual conference, aiming to address concerns over declining police visibility.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA star Kevin Durant's access to his bitcoin account on the cryptocurrency exchange has been restored after he was locked out for years. The issue gained public attention after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference, joking that the rising value of bitcoin had benefited them during the lockout. Durant, an early investor in both bitcoin and Coinbase itself, purchased the digital currency in 2016. The incident has renewed discussions about Coinbase's customer service protocols, prompting Armstrong to state the company is focusing on improving its support experience.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors at a staggering $200 billion valuation, according to sources. This fundraising effort highlights the massive and rapidly increasing valuations for companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied that xAI is currently raising capital, the report suggests significant investor interest in the company. The funds would likely be used to acquire vast amounts of computing power and talent needed to develop next-generation AI systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses are set to face France in a highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final in Bristol, with the winner advancing to the final at Twickenham. As the tournament hosts and world's top-ranked team, England is the clear favorite, having won their last 16 matches against the French. However, their most recent encounter was a narrow 43-42 victory in the Six Nations, suggesting a competitive match is expected. The victor will play Canada, who secured their place in the final after a stunning upset victory over defending champions New Zealand.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, despite the Federal Reserve implementing its first interest rate cut of the year. The yield climbed to 4.127% as investors assessed broader economic indicators, including positive labor market data that eased concerns about a significant slowdown. This counterintuitive market reaction suggests that investors are weighing factors like future economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance alongside the Fed's monetary policy adjustments.

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly has clarified that minority owner Tom Brady is not involved in weekly game planning, contrary to a recent broadcast report. Kelly explained that while he uses the legendary quarterback as a valuable resource for general football strategy and insights, they do not collaborate on specific game plans for upcoming opponents. The clarification came after an ESPN sideline report suggested Brady speaks with Kelly two to three times a week to go over film and the game plan. Head coach Pete Carroll also called the initial report inaccurate.</p>

The trust aims to raise the $260 million asking price to restore the land to abundance, address issues like housing and water systems, and return stewardship to the local Hawaiian community in an unprecedented large-scale land-back initiative.</p>
