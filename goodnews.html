The Platinum card currently has a $695 annual fee, while the Sapphire has a $550 fee, with rumors circulating that JPMorgan might increase its fee to $795.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge after President Donald Trump approved the company's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants prematurely. Despite Trump's description of the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel confirmed it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, and all regulatory approvals have been received.</p>

          <p>Recent trade talks in London have sparked cautious optimism about de-escalating tensions between the US and China, raising questions about whether this momentum can extend to broader bilateral dialogue. Negotiators agreed on a framework to implement the consensus reached in Geneva and during a recent call between the two state leaders. The talks addressed rare earths, Chinese student visas, and US exports of jet engine parts to China, with both sides expressing positive sentiments. Experts suggest this progress could pave the way for discussions on military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation, as well as the restoration of important dialogue mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City has significantly reduced traffic in lower Manhattan, improving commutes and raising funds for public transit. Since January, a $9 toll for entering lower Manhattan has resulted in 70,000 fewer vehicles daily and faster bus routes. The policy aims to generate $500 million annually for transit upgrades, with early data showing positive environmental and economic impacts. Despite initial opposition, public sentiment has improved, though the program faces ongoing legal challenges and potential threats from the Trump administration, which seeks to revoke federal approval.</p>

          <p>Richard Ellmann's biography of James Joyce, published in 1959, played a crucial role in establishing Joyce as a literary icon, blending detailed life events with subtle psychological portrayals and critical interpretations. Ellmann's work made Joyce accessible to a broader audience and influenced the field of literary studies, though his approach has been critiqued for downplaying Joyce's political interests. Zachary Leader's recent biography of Ellmann explores the creation and impact of Ellmann's work, highlighting a moment in American cultural history when such a comprehensive literary biography could appeal both inside and outside academia. The article reflects on the evolving landscape of literary studies and the enduring power of Ellmann's portrait of Joyce.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to experience its first heatwave of 2025, with temperatures set to climb above 30C (86F) this week due to an area of high pressure. Some areas could surpass the highest temperature recorded this year, which was 29.4C (85F) in Suffolk on June 13. For a heatwave to be officially declared by the Met Office, threshold temperatures must be reached for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in eastern England.

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to drop containers of live mosquitoes in remote forests to combat avian malaria and save endangered honeycreepers. The mosquitoes are male and contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia, which prevents their eggs from hatching when they mate with local females. The goal is to reduce the population of malaria-carrying mosquitoes without harming the local ecosystem, as mosquitoes are not native to Hawaii. This approach, known as the incompatible insect technique (IIT), has shown promise in other parts of the world for controlling mosquito populations and stemming the spread of human diseases.</p>

These women argue that women can successfully balance motherhood and career aspirations, advocating for policies like federal parental leave and remote work. They express frustration with the idea that women must choose between being an "evil feminist career woman" or a stay-at-home mother. While embracing progressive-leaning views on family policy, they also emphasize the importance of women's contributions in the workplace and the fulfillment that children bring to life.</p>
