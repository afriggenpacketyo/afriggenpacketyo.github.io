          <h2>Report Highlights Key Findings on Grooming Gangs and Child Sexual Exploitation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 12:12:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A government-commissioned review led by Baroness Casey examines abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales, revealing critical flaws in data collection, particularly concerning the ethnicity of perpetrators. The report emphasizes the under-reporting of group-based child sexual exploitation, citing approximately 700 recorded offenses in 2023, which is likely a gross underestimation. It advocates for mandatory collection of ethnicity and nationality data for suspects in child sexual abuse cases and recommends a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, overseen by an Independent Commission with full powers to compel witnesses. The review also urges tightening laws to ensure adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault and calls for a review of criminal convictions of victims of child sexual exploitation. The report underscores the need to see children as children, reinforcing safeguarding measures in taxi licensing to prevent further exploitation.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, addressing the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and stating that Iran needs to make a deal. While at the summit, Trump indicated that he would not sign a G7 statement on Iran, but would continue to work toward preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. He also discussed trade and tariffs with world leaders, reiterating his stance as a "tariff person" and suggesting the possibility of China joining the group. Trump also mentioned Vladimir Putin's exclusion from the group in 2014, noting that Putin speaks to him and felt insulted by the removal. His remarks come amid strained relationships with some U.S. allies due to tariffs and previous musings about acquiring Canada and Greenland.</p>

Attorneys praised the settlement for providing much-needed funds to communities recovering from the opioid crisis, adding to over $50 billion in opioid payouts by corporations.

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to strip USAID and public broadcasting of $9.4 billion by a vote of 214-212, showcasing the slim majority held by the GOP. The bill, representing the first "rescissions" effort to claw back previously approved funds, faced challenges as several Republicans initially opposed the measure. Speaker Mike Johnson secured crucial votes through last-minute negotiations, ensuring the bill's passage despite distractions from a controversial incident involving a Democratic senator. The narrow victory underscores Johnson's ability to navigate the fractious House Republican Conference, achieving a series of slim victories on tough bills throughout the year, such as initial framework for the Big, Beautiful Bill, interim spending bill, and finally the Big, Beautiful Bill.</p>

The juror was replaced by an alternative juror, a 57-year-old white father from Westchester, the judge noted that there were six alternative jurors to preserve the "integrity" of the court.

          <p>The financial markets showed limited reaction to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, with major U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling, traders are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict disrupting the global economy. Deutsche Bank macro strategist Henry Allen noted that geopolitical events typically impact markets only when they affect macro variables like growth and inflation. The price of oil is a key factor, with the biggest risk being Iran shutting down the Strait of Hormuz, which could cause oil prices to spike above $100 a barrel. Citigroup's Max Layton noted a significant geopolitical risk premium already exists in the market, but OPEC's increasing oil production is counterbalancing crude prices.</p>

Some companies, like OrderlyMeds, plan to personalize compounded versions of drugs like tirzepatide and semaglutide by adding supplements, this approach aims to differentiate the drugs from exact copies of commercially available medications. The FDA allows compounding pharmacies to make copies of brand-name drugs during shortages, but the end of shortages raises questions about the legality of continuing this practice. Some telehealth companies have transitioned to agreements with Novo Nordisk and Lilly to sell their medicines, while others are testing the FDA's rules by continuing to make and sell the compounded drugs.</p>
