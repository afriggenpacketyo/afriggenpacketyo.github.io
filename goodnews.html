          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered a tsunami, a wave of misinformation has spread online, including out-of-context videos and AI-generated fakes. DW Fact Check has debunked several viral claims, such as old footage of an earthquake in Bangkok being presented as new and a video of a South African storm being mislabeled as the tsunami. The article also addresses false claims about Oprah Winfrey blocking a road in Hawaii and clarifies that beached whales in Japan were likely unrelated to the seismic event, highlighting the prevalence of disinformation during major crises.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has outlined his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, centered on the concept of 'personal superintelligence.' In a letter released ahead of the company's earnings report, he described this as a tool for individual empowerment rather than a centralized force for automation. This announcement follows Meta's recent multi-billion dollar spending spree to hire top AI talent and establish a new Superintelligence Labs unit. The move signals a major strategic push to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the rapidly advancing field of AI.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has increased its position in industrial company Dover, citing the stock's recent pullback as a buying opportunity despite a solid quarterly report and raised outlook. The analysis highlights Dover's record profitability and promising sales forecast, viewing the market's lack of a positive reaction as unjustified. The article also notes that if unrestricted, the club would consider buying shares of Starbucks on its post-earnings weakness and Palo Alto Networks following the announcement of its large acquisition of CyberArk, seeing strategic value in the deal.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its upcoming meeting, despite facing complex economic data and political pressure. While no policy shift is anticipated, the meeting holds intrigue due to potential dissents from governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who have advocated for a rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely face questions about the economy, the inflationary impact of tariffs, and recent White House criticism. Analysts believe the committee will maintain its current stance, postponing any decision on a rate cut until at least September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new form of geothermal energy, known as 'superhot geothermal,' is being developed to meet the immense power demands of artificial intelligence. This technology involves drilling miles deep to access extremely hot rocks, which can generate up to ten times more power per well than traditional geothermal methods. Startups like Quaise Energy are pioneering systems that can vaporize rock to reach these depths. This innovation could provide a consistent, clean power source for data centers and is receiving strong support from the Department of Energy as a solution for future energy needs.</p>
