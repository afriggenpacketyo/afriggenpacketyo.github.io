          <p>Pop Mart International, a Chinese toymaker known for its trendy character-based toys, has seen its market capitalization exceed HK$300 billion on the Hong Kong stock market. The company's shares have risen significantly, driven by the popularity of the Labubu character from "The Monsters" series, which has boosted overseas sales. JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, projecting substantial growth in global revenue and gross merchandise value. Pop Mart's success is attributed to its ability to cultivate intellectual property that resonates with Generation Z consumers.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. This price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Additionally, positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's willingness to allow clients to buy Bitcoin have supported the market. (not investment advice)</p>
