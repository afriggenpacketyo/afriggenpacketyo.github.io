The policy aims to prevent foreign officials from issuing arrest warrants or demanding censorship on American tech platforms.

The new policy's implementation details remain to be seen, but it is likely to target officials from countries with a history of targeting individuals for criticizing their governments on social media.</p>

          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being. The survey found that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, more than an income of $500,000 or assets of $1 million. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa noted that the median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, and having that cash on hand provides confidence to handle unexpected expenses. The article concludes that saving something is better than saving nothing, and suggests strategies like budgeting or automating savings.</p>

          <p>CNBC Make It is launching a book club, with their first book being "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki. The book explores whether it is foolish to believe that people remain fundamentally decent. Zaki argues that a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" aligns with better outcomes and that "anyone can learn." He discovered that "cynics end up sicker, sadder, poorer, and more wrong."</p>

          <p>Former World Trade Organization head Pascal Lamy suggests there is "common ground" for China and the European Union to cooperate on, despite tariff negotiations with the United States. Lamy suggests that the EU welcome Chinese investment in electric vehicles, provided they produce in the EU. The other common interest that China and the EU share is their decarbonisation drive. Lamy's comment came as the world has been grappling with uncertainties introduced by US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies.</p>
