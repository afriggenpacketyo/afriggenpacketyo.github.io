          <p>Rod Stewart, the 80-year-old rock star, has cancelled several US concerts due to the flu, ahead of his performance at the Glastonbury festival later this month.

          <p>This article addresses and disproves several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy. These claims include the assertions that wind turbines are killing whales and birds, are not truly green due to recycling issues, and are inefficient. The article cites data from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the US Fish & Wildlife Service to counter these claims, noting that there is no scientific evidence linking wind turbines to whale deaths and that cats and building collisions are far greater threats to birds. It also addresses the issue of turbine blade recycling, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve recycling rates and implement landfill bans. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking a more aggressive stance against antisemitism, launching investigations and penalizing universities. Harmeet Dhillon, DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, emphasized that violent rhetoric and actions targeting Jewish students and institutions are not protected by the First Amendment. Recent incidents, including attacks on pro-Israel demonstrations and assaults on Jewish individuals, have prompted increased scrutiny and enforcement. The administration is also focusing on non-citizen students accused of supporting Palestinian causes in ways deemed hostile to U.S. interests, while civil rights groups caution against overreach that could infringe on free speech and protest rights.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential challenges and security considerations involved in converting a luxury jet from Qatar into Air Force One for President Trump's use. While Trump wants the jet ready quickly, installing security capabilities equivalent to the current Air Force One could be costly and time-consuming, potentially requiring some security precautions to be skipped. Key requirements for Air Force One include survivability, secure communications, and anti-missile measures. The article explores the potential costs, timeline, and security trade-offs involved in the conversion process, as well as the possibility of Trump waiving certain requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit on rental assistance. The Delaware program also requires recipients to work and provides financial coaching and savings incentives. While the Trump administration proposed a two-year time limit nationally, housing experts argue that such limits are unrealistic and ineffective without additional support. The article contrasts Delaware's approach with a failed program in Washington state, highlighting the importance of savings accounts and comprehensive support services in helping people achieve self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the liquor industry by favoring low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages over traditional baijiu, a strong distilled spirit. This shift is prompting Chinese liquor brands to innovate and target younger consumers, particularly urban women. In Baisha, a town famous for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums for lighter wines instead of sorghum grain used in baijiu. Industry insiders believe this trend reflects a broader shift towards self-indulgent experiences and emotional companionship rather than social rituals associated with traditional alcohol consumption.</p>

Former employees who leave their 401(k)s with their previous employers may be charged maintenance fees that erode their principal and reduce potential compound growth. While rolling over funds into an IRA is an option, IRAs often have higher investment fees.
