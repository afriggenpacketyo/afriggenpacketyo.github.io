          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 propelled England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series with one game to spare. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, reaching his highest ODI score. Despite a shaky start at 93-4, Root's partnerships with Harry Brook and Will Jacks guided England to their target of 309. West Indies' innings was highlighted by Keacy Carty's century, but England's sloppy fielding and Rashid's bowling ultimately contributed to their downfall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Trump administration's tariff policies, asserting that some companies will not pass on tariff costs to consumers, despite warnings from retailers like Walmart and Best Buy about potential price hikes. Bessent highlighted that companies like Home Depot and Amazon have indicated they will absorb tariff costs. He emphasized the administration's goal to 'de-risk' rather than 'decouple' from China, citing national and economic security as justification for the trade stance. Bessent also pointed to decreasing food and energy prices and stated that overall inflation is declining, despite industry concerns about the impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
