          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit, where the Gaza peace plan is expected to be signed, marking a potential historic turning point after two years of conflict. Downing Street emphasized the UK's "key role" in shaping the plan, although this assertion was challenged by US Ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israel's deputy foreign minister, who credited President Trump. The summit, co-led by Trump and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, will gather over 20 world leaders to formalize the ceasefire, facilitate urgent humanitarian assistance into Gaza, and establish a foundation for lasting peace and security. Starmer is set to thank Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey for their efforts and urge continued coordination towards the truce's next phases.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that Hamas might release the remaining 20 hostages "a little bit early" as he headed to the Middle East to oversee the peace deal. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump expressed satisfaction with the progress, calling the initial retrieval of captives "amazing" and noting his administration's involvement in the complex negotiations. His comments precede a Monday deadline for Hamas to return all remaining hostages to Israel, a crucial element of the peace agreement that brought an end to the two-year Israel-Hamas conflict. The president's visit highlights the intensive diplomatic efforts aimed at finalizing this significant phase of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau shared his insights on what China needs to achieve global leadership in science, focusing on the crucial development of domestically groomed talent. He discussed the ongoing formulation of China's 15th five-year plan, suggesting its potential to overcome technology "choke points" amidst escalating tensions with the United States. Yau acknowledged China's substantial progress in manufacturing, largely attributing this success to its vast and competent skilled labor force, which allows it to effectively challenge the US in certain technological sectors. His perspective underscores the importance of internal capacity building for sustained scientific and industrial advancement.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin indicates India's strategic effort to reset historically tense relations with China. Modi stressed the importance of partnership over rivalry and a commitment to a "fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement" of their border dispute, while asserting India's "strategic autonomy" from external influences like the US. Both leaders envision Sino-Indian ties as a cornerstone of a multipolar world and a new Asian century, aiming to foster solidarity among developing countries. The imminent resumption of direct flights further underscores a shared commitment to improving bilateral relations and potentially forging a powerful Eastern powers coalition.</p>

          <p>Food and beverage giant Danone has agreed to modify its marketing statements concerning plastic recycling and committed to supporting plastic waste reduction, settling two significant lawsuits. The Earth Island Institute and Plastic Pollution Coalition alleged Danone contributed to plastic pollution and engaged in "greenwashing" through misleading sustainability claims, specifically regarding Evian water bottles. Despite denying the claims, Danone will dedicate funds over the next three years to develop plastic-free alternatives for Evian in the US and will add a statement to its website about the limitations of plastic recycling. This outcome underscores the increasing scrutiny on corporate environmental responsibility and the widespread impact of plastic pollution, including microplastics, on health and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Scotland's qualification path for the 2026 World Cup finals has significantly clarified, with the team now assured of finishing either first or second in their group. A recent victory against Belarus, combined with Denmark's win over Greece, sets the stage for a decisive clash between Scotland and Denmark for an automatic qualification spot. Both nations are currently level on 10 points, though Denmark possesses a substantial goal difference advantage. Scotland will first travel to face Greece next month, followed by a critical home encounter against Denmark, where a victory would likely secure their place in the finals and bypass the play-off stage.</p>

          <p>Scotland secured a 2-1 victory over Belarus, which, combined with Denmark's win, guaranteed them at least a play-off spot for the 2026 World Cup. Despite this crucial result, coach Steve Clarke expressed profound anger over his team's "lacklustre" performance, with midfielder John McGinn calling his half-time reaction the "wildest" he'd witnessed in 72 games. The team's subdued play and defensive vulnerabilities against Belarus, mirroring earlier struggles against Greece, caused significant frustration among both players and the 49,000 fans at Hampden. While acknowledging their strong qualifying position, the squad recognizes the urgent need for substantial improvement ahead of decisive matches against Greece and Denmark to secure automatic qualification.</p>

Lake's contributions included an interception and a fumble recovery, while Verse made a critical goal-line stand.

Germany's holiday regulations are typically state-specific and often rooted in Christian traditions. This agreement extends the same principle of unpaid leave for religious observance to Muslim holidays, aligning with existing state laws and promoting integration and equality within a diverse society.</p>
