          <p>Traditional economic data is lagging in reflecting the impact of tariffs and trade uncertainty, leading economists to seek alternative indicators such as McDonald's sales, container ship traffic, and hotel bookings. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these unconventional measures to inform monetary policy decisions, facing challenges similar to those during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Conflicting signals from anecdotes and alternative data sources are complicating the Fed's decisions on interest rates, as officials weigh the risks of slowing growth against rising inflation. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's trade policies, which have led to increased consumer prices and shifts in business operations.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate its Energy Star offices, a program that has guided consumers toward energy-efficient appliances for decades, according to agency documents. Consumer and environmental groups are raising concerns about the impact of these cuts, which align with the Trump administration's shift away from climate change initiatives. Since its launch in 1992, Energy Star has reduced energy costs by over $500 billion and prevented significant greenhouse gas emissions, but faces proposed elimination under Trump's budget, which views the program as an overreach of government authority. Critics argue that losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to access trustworthy information about products' energy use.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to serve as the U.S. Surgeon General, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Means, who advocates for Kennedy's ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äù agenda, is known for her focus on addressing the root causes of chronic illness and her skepticism towards traditional medicine. She co-founded Levels, a health app connected to glucose monitors, and gained prominence for decrying the influence of the food and drug industry. While Means has expressed support for vaccine safety, her views have caused some friction within Kennedy's anti-vaccine base.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, with further reductions predicted later in the year, potentially lowering borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. Analysts anticipate a cut to 4.25% from 4.5%, though possibilities for no change or a larger reduction remain. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is closely monitoring inflation and global economic uncertainty, including the impact of President Trump's tariff policy. The likelihood of rate cuts has already influenced mortgage pricing, with lenders reducing rates on new fixed deals, although further falls are not guaranteed.</p>

Kirby suggests limiting the airport to 48 flights per hour during construction, returning Newark to a Level 3 slot-controlled airport, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing air traffic control. The delays began after a communications and radar outage in the Philadelphia air traffic control facility, and the FAA is taking steps to improve speed, reliability, and redundancy.
