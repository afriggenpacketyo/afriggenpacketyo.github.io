          <p>A U.S. CV-22 Osprey aircraft made a safe "precautionary landing" at Hanamaki Airport in northeastern Japan after reporting a mid-flight mechanical issue. No injuries were reported, and commercial airport operations were not disrupted. This incident follows another recent precautionary landing by a U.S. Osprey in Japan and comes after a fatal crash in 2023 that grounded the fleet for months, keeping the aircraft's safety record under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has paused its monetary easing cycle, keeping interest rates steady at 2% after a series of eight cuts over the past year. The decision was widely expected as policymakers adopt a "wait and watch" approach amid significant economic uncertainty, particularly concerning potential new US trade tariffs. While inflation has returned to the bank's 2% target, officials indicated no urgency for further adjustments, awaiting clarity on the future of transatlantic trade relations.

          <p>NASA successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to improve understanding and prediction of "space weather," which can disrupt GPS, communication satellites, and power grids. The satellites will fly in tandem to precisely measure how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere, a process that drives auroral displays but also poses risks to technology and astronauts.</p>
