          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa is reportedly planning not to run for a third term in 2026, a decision that would open up a competitive Senate race. First elected in 2014, Ernst is the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and has held several leadership positions within her party. Her departure is expected to prompt Representative Ashley Hinson to announce a bid for the seat, setting the stage for a significant political contest in a state that has trended Republican in recent federal elections but where Democrats have seen some recent local success.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy amid a dysfunctional international system. As a leader of a major economic power that bridges competing ideologies, Prabowo can champion a model of "constructive pragmatism." The article argues that Indonesia's unique non-aligned stance allows it to foster cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a potential corrective for global institutions like the United Nations, which are often paralyzed by national agendas, offering a practical path forward for international relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presenting an ambitious and large-scale take on Mary Shelley's classic novel. The Netflix-funded film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, exploring the story from both characters' perspectives. Del Toro, known for humanizing monstrous figures, aimed to portray the creature with beauty and as a newborn being. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scope and artistry, while others find it lacks the emotional voltage to fully come to life.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, this article examines how remembering the shared history of U.S.-China cooperation during World War II could help improve current bilateral relations. It highlights forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen from the Japanese army. The piece suggests that focusing on this historical alliance against a common foe could provide a foundation for rebuilding trust and fostering better ties from the ground up. This historical perspective offers a potential formula for navigating the complexities of the modern U.S.-China relationship.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, American Taylor Townsend, following their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" and "no class," reportedly over a disputed net cord incident. In a social media post, Ostapenko clarified that English is not her first language and her use of the word "education" was meant to refer to tennis etiquette. She acknowledged her words could have been offensive and expressed her regret for the incident.</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Guidelines on Safe Screen Time for Children at Different Developmental Stages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article synthesizes expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that recommendations vary by developmental stage. For toddlers, the guideline is "screen-free until age three" to encourage exploration of the physical world, while the WHO suggests no more than one hour for children aged two and up. For kindergarteners, a maximum of 30 minutes is advised to foster imagination and social interaction. As children enter elementary school and adolescence, supervised time increases, but the focus shifts to content quality, open communication with parents, and preventing media use from becoming a secretive or isolating habit.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media. He was photographed on a family golf outing in Washington, D.C., appearing to be in good health. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a tragedy occurred, which raised concerns about Trump's well-being. The White House has previously addressed health concerns, attributing visible bruising on his hands to frequent handshaking and noting a benign diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.</p>
