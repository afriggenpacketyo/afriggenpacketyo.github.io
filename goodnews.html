          <p>Tesla has released an updated version of its full self-driving supervised technology, though investor attention is focused on a potential major product reveal teased for October 7th. Speculation is rampant that the company may finally unveil its long-awaited lower-cost model or the next-generation Roadster, as it has not released a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in late 2023. The announcement comes as Tesla seeks to shift its narrative towards robotics and self-driving capabilities amid a slump in auto sales, which has been attributed to increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed over 225% after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The move is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This partnership reverses a Biden-era decision that had blocked the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development in the state. The project aims to secure domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on China for essential minerals used in defense and energy infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startups are remaining private for significantly longer periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely attributed to the massive influx of alternative capital from sources like private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds, which now exceed $12 trillion globally. This abundance of private funding provides startups with sufficient capital for growth without the regulatory burdens and short-term pressures of the public market. Consequently, companies are more mature and have substantially larger revenues by the time they eventually pursue an IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has proposed the creation of an "open and shared sustainable mega constellation" (OSSMC), an ambitious global network of AI-powered satellites. Led by space instrumentation professor Yang Jun, the project aims to address two major challenges: the increasing crowding of low Earth orbit and the need for equitable access to space resources. With over a million satellites already filed for launch worldwide, primarily by private ventures like SpaceX's Starlink, the proposal presents a collaborative Chinese solution. The initiative is framed as a step toward building a shared future for humanity in space systems.</p>

          <p>Ghana is working to pass the Organ and Tissue Donation Bill to create a legal framework for organ transplants, addressing a critical healthcare gap in the nation. Currently, high costs and a lack of regulation force many Ghanaians to forgo necessary procedures, such as kidney and corneal transplants, or seek expensive treatment abroad. The proposed bill aims to establish a regulatory authority, transplantation centers, and a national registry to ensure safe, ethical, and affordable access to these life-saving operations. Proponents argue that with proper regulation, the cost of procedures could be dramatically reduced, though challenges like illegal organ harvesting and medical brain drain remain.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock climb 5% after the company raised its long-term revenue and profit growth expectations during an analyst meeting. The computer maker now projects annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, a significant increase from its previous 3% to 4% forecast, and expects earnings per share to grow by at least 15%. Dell attributed the optimistic outlook to the unprecedented pace of technological change, particularly the surging customer demand for AI infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking solutions. The company is a key partner for Nvidia, building and selling computer systems that utilize its advanced AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the second quarter of 2025, the highest proportion in five years, according to a new report. While the overall number of homes sold has decreased, the investor share has grown, indicating their continued significant role in providing liquidity to a weaker housing market. The vast majority of these buyers are small investors owning ten or fewer properties, while large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters. Investors continue to focus on lower-priced homes, paying an average of $455,481, well below the national average home price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asset manager Ares Management has increased its three-year fundraising targets by 25%, citing stronger-than-expected momentum from individual wealthy investors moving into alternative assets. CEO Michael Arougheti highlighted that this "retail revolution" is a response to investors seeking diversification away from increasingly concentrated public markets. Ares, which already manages over $50 billion in retail-targeted vehicles, refutes the narrative that weaker deals are funneled to individual investors, arguing that both retail and institutional clients often receive allocations in the same high-quality investments. The firm is capitalizing on this trend by expanding its product development and client education efforts globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has significantly increased its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This optimistic revision is attributed to factors like front-loading of U.S. imports ahead of tariffs and strong demand for AI-related goods, which drove nearly half of the trade expansion in the first half of the year. However, the outlook for 2026 has been drastically cut to just 0.5% growth, as the WTO anticipates a cooling global economy and the full impact of widespread trade tariffs being felt.
