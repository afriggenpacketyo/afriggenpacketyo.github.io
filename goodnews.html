          <p>Following its second bankruptcy filing in seven years, tween accessories retailer Claire's has been partially acquired by private holding company Ames Watson. The firm, which purchased roughly 1,000 North American stores, plans a major overhaul, viewing the company as a "broken business, not a broken brand." The revitalization strategy focuses on updating merchandise to reflect current trends, improving employee pay and training, and launching a fresh marketing campaign that leans into nostalgia. Ames Watson aims to make Claire's profitable from day one by modernizing the brand while preserving the core experience that made it a generational rite of passage.</p>

He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert in November 2024. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because the prosecution failed to obtain the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza, declaring, "Your attempts to silence us have failed."</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to help religious institutions build affordable housing on their property by overriding restrictive local zoning laws. This legislation is part of a growing national "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) movement, which aims to address the housing crisis by utilizing the vast amounts of land owned by churches, synagogues, and mosques. While similar state-level efforts in places like Texas and Colorado have faced significant pushback over local control, advocates are hopeful that federal action could pressure states to adopt these reforms. The bill requires that new housing primarily serves low-income families and is open to all, regardless of religious belief.</p>

          <p>Actor Tim Allen shared that he was profoundly moved by Erika Kirk's speech at her late husband Charlie's memorial, where she publicly forgave the man accused of his assassination. Allen revealed on social media that her words inspired him to finally forgive the drunk driver responsible for his own father's death in 1964, a struggle he has faced for over 60 years. At the memorial, Erika Kirk stated that the answer to hate is love, a message that contrasted with the politically charged speeches that followed. Allen's post reflects on his own tumultuous relationship with faith following his father's tragic death when the actor was just 11 years old.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, UK health officials are warning of a potential seasonal rise in both influenza and COVID-19 cases, urging the public to understand the differences between the two viruses. While both can present with similar respiratory symptoms, the flu often arrives suddenly with fever and exhaustion, whereas COVID-19's symptoms have evolved to include cold-like signs such as a runny nose and a notably hoarse throat. Cases of the new COVID-19 strain, called Stratus, are increasing, but experts are not overly concerned, viewing it as normal viral mutation. Officials strongly encourage eligible individuals, especially vulnerable groups, to receive both the flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines to prevent severe illness and reduce strain on hospitals.</p>

          <h2>Marine Ecosystems Found Thriving on Unexploded World War II Bombs in Baltic Sea</h2>

          <p>A submersible expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered vibrant marine ecosystems flourishing on unexploded Nazi-era munitions from World War II. Researchers were stunned to find dense populations of animals, including approximately 40,000 marine worms per square meter, covering the surfaces of ten V-1 flying bombs. The study, published in Communications Earth & Environment, highlights the irony of deadly weapons becoming hubs for life, providing the hard surfaces necessary for species like mussels, crabs, and starfish to thrive on the otherwise sandy seafloor. In a particularly unusual observation, dozens of starfishes were seen gathered directly on an exposed chunk of TNT, baffling scientists.</p>

          <p>A coordinated sting operation led by Interpol has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of involvement in widespread cyber scams across 14 African countries. The operation targeted criminal networks that use digital platforms for romance scams and "sextortion," where victims are blackmailed with explicit images. Authorities identified over 1,400 victims who collectively lost nearly $2.8 million. The crackdown, which took place between July and August, also led to the seizure of numerous devices and the dismantling of 81 cyber-crime groups. Interpol officials noted a sharp rise in such digital-enabled crimes, which cause both significant financial and psychological harm to victims.</p>

          <p>In a podcast conversation, retired Admiral William McRaven reflects on whether the United States is still perceived as a force for good in the world. McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, argues that America's historical greatness is tied to its goodness, citing actions like the Marshall Plan. He expresses concern that recent transactional foreign policies and inconsistent engagement with allies are eroding this image, though he remains optimistic about the American people's character. The discussion also explores the military's apolitical role, emphasizing that its duty is to the Constitution, not to a specific president, and that lawful orders must be followed while unlawful ones must be resisted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL's upcoming game in Dublin between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings represents a significant homecoming for the Steelers' founding Rooney family. The family's ancestors emigrated from Newry, County Down, during the Great Famine in the 1840s, with Art Rooney eventually founding the team in 1933. His son, Dan Rooney, was instrumental in the team's success and also served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, fostering deep philanthropic and cultural ties. This regular-season game at Croke Park is seen as a culmination of the family's enduring connection to their Irish heritage, making the event much more than just a football game for the organization and its fans.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart Welcomes Cooling Resale Market for Popular Labubu Toys</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 05:41:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a summer of intense hype that saw its Labubu monster toys command massive markups on the secondary market, Chinese toy company Pop Mart says it is pleased to see resale prices falling. The company stated that its products are intended for genuine fans, not for profit-driven scalpers, and that an inflated resale market is unsustainable. Pop Mart has significantly ramped up production to meet demand, which has contributed to the price drop and allowed more fans to purchase the toys at retail value. Analysts see this shift as a healthy, long-term move to build a sustainable brand rather than relying on a speculative bubble.</p>
