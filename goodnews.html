          <p>David Liao Yi-chien, HSBC's co-CEO, reported that multinational companies are increasingly directing investments towards China's new-economy sectors, including high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. This strategic reorientation reflects global companies positioning China as a key market for driving innovation, consumption, and growth, with continued optimism for consumption-related industries. An HSBC survey indicated that China is the top target market for companies looking to enhance global trade capabilities, with around 40% planning to increase manufacturing there over the next two years. The nation's vast market size, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent are cited as primary attractions for international capital.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, announced after a trade deal with the United States that reduced tariffs on Japanese car imports, has initiated a period of political transition in Japan. While China's foreign ministry has refrained from commenting, calling it an internal matter, analysts anticipate that Tokyo will continue to view Beijing as a strategic competitor. The new leader will face the significant challenge of navigating the complex and often contentious relationship between Japan and China, a key dynamic in regional stability. This leadership change highlights the delicate balance of economic interests and geopolitical rivalries in East Asia.</p>

          <p>French AI firm Mistral AI has achieved an impressive 11.7 billion-euro ($13.8 billion) valuation in a Series C funding round, with Dutch chip equipment maker ASML securing a major stake. ASML's 1.3 billion-euro investment granted it an 11% shareholding, more than doubling Mistral's previous valuation and highlighting the substantial capital flowing into the booming AI industry. Mistral, considered one of Europe's most competitive tech startups, specializes in building large language models that underpin AI applications such as chatbots. This significant investment solidifies Mistral's position as a key player and regional rival to companies like OpenAI, underscoring its rapid development and market potential.</p>

          <p>India urged its BRICS partners to address significant trade imbalances, particularly with China and Russia, during a virtual summit where the bloc collectively rallied against US tariffs. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted India's largest trade deficits being with BRICS members, advocating for expeditious solutions to these imbalances. This call for internal trade review within BRICS contrasts with the more direct condemnation of US policies by other members like Brazil and China, who warned against "Hegemonism" and "protectionism." The article also notes that despite bilateral trade strains with the US, India's relationship with China shows signs of warming, reflecting complex geopolitical and economic alignments.

          <p>England's football coach Thomas Tuchel faces his most significant test in an upcoming World Cup qualifier against Serbia, held in the intensely atmospheric Rajko Mitic Stadium in Belgrade. Despite England's flawless qualifying record of four wins and no goals conceded, critics argue the team's performances under Tuchel have been uninspiring since he replaced Sir Gareth Southgate. This away match, set in a passionate environment partially restricted due to prior fan misconduct, will truly gauge the team's resilience and progress under the German coach. Tuchel, however, remains optimistic, describing this encounter as a crucial "proof of concept" for his World Cup preparations, aiming to demonstrate an improvement in team identity and performance.</p>

          <p>China Unicom has been granted a satellite mobile communication business license, a significant step towards the large-scale commercial rollout of its home-grown satellite services, positioning it to potentially rival Starlink. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's approval allows the state-owned company to offer direct-to-phone satellite connectivity and expand applications in emergency and maritime communications. This initiative aims to foster a competitive market, enhance internet accessibility for everyday users, and strengthen the resilience of supply chains within the industry. The license follows a recent guideline encouraging telecoms operators to utilize low-orbit satellite internet and comes on the heels of China Unicom's successful launch of four low-orbit satellites, including one with advanced narrowband Internet of Things capabilities.</p>

          <p>Boeing aircraft orders have become a recurring and prominent feature in President Trump's bilateral trade deals, serving both symbolic and pragmatic purposes. These high-profile, high-value purchases allow partner countries to visibly demonstrate their commitment to reducing bilateral trade surpluses with the US, without causing political friction by impacting domestic industries. Unlike sensitive commodities, aircraft imports are less contentious, and their extended delivery windows offer financial flexibility to airlines. Beyond their symbolic weight, these planes are genuinely needed due to the global tourism upswing and the effective duopoly between Boeing and Airbus. Despite recent safety concerns, Boeing's perceived improvements in quality further solidify its significant role in these agreements. (not investment advice)</p>
