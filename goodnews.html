          <p>Citizens in Switzerland are voting in a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, with early projections showing a tight race. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data protection concerns and the involvement of private firms in its operation. The revised plan ensures the system is optional, managed entirely by the state, and stores data on users' smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue it will streamline bureaucratic processes online, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy infringements and data misuse, despite the new safeguards designed to limit access to specific personal details.</p>

          <p>Following the Pentagon's decision to take an equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials, the Trump administration is reportedly considering more deals to bolster the U.S. supply chain for critical minerals like rare earths and lithium. Industry leaders are urging for federal investment, including price floors, to counter China's market dominance and stabilize volatile prices for miners. This strategic shift, which mimics China's model of state-backed capitalism, has caused significant stock surges for companies like Energy Fuels and Lithium Americas, which are seen as potential targets for government support. The goal is to reduce dependency on foreign nations for materials essential to defense and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is forecasting approximately 2.4 billion journeys during its upcoming eight-day "golden week" holiday, a major travel period that authorities hope will provide a significant boost to the nation's consumer economy. The holiday begins on National Day and incorporates the Mid-Autumn Festival. Officials project that travel by car will be the dominant mode of transport, accounting for nearly 80% of all trips, with an estimated 1.87 billion people traveling by road. The peak travel day is expected to be Wednesday, with projections of over 340 million journeys, surpassing the numbers seen during this year's Lunar New Year holiday.</p>

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, believed to have been unearthed by Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been discovered in Fort Myers, Florida, adding to the state's extensive collection of historical log boats. State archaeologists find this 9-foot canoe particularly unusual because it is made of mahogany and likely originated outside of Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks suggest it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating has so far produced inconclusive results, its unique form and material provide new insights into the region's maritime history and potential long-distance travel or trade centuries ago.</p>

          <h2>China's J-35 Fighter Jet Claimed to Have Radar Cross-Section Smaller Than a Human Palm</h2>

          <p>A report from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV claims that the nation's J-35 stealth fighter jet has a radar cross-section smaller than a human palm, suggesting a high level of stealth capability. The low observability is attributed to the aircraft's unique airframe design and the use of proprietary metamaterial technology. This claim positions the J-35 as a formidable competitor in stealth technology. For comparison, the report notes that the radar cross-section of the U.S. F-35 fighter is often cited as being around the size of a golf ball, indicating the two aircraft may have comparable stealth characteristics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's recent Women's Rugby World Cup victory is the culmination of strategic decisions made nearly a decade ago to professionalize the sport. The establishment of a new domestic league in 2016 and the introduction of full-time central contracts for players in 2018 have been pivotal. These moves, backed by significant funding and sponsor pressure, dramatically raised the standard of play and created immense strength in depth for the national team, the Red Roses. Once struggling against rivals like New Zealand, England has become the dominant force in women's rugby, winning six straight Grand Slams and boasting a 33-Test winning streak.</p>

          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support the company and its suppliers following a prolonged production halt caused by a cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has forced JLR to suspend operations for weeks, raising concerns that smaller suppliers could face bankruptcy. The loan guarantee, provided through the Export Development Guarantee, is intended to protect thousands of jobs and provide certainty to the supply chain as the shutdown continues. This is reportedly the first instance of a company receiving government aid due to a cyberattack, with JLR's production not expected to resume before October.</p>

          <p>Ford achieved its best-ever month for electric vehicle sales in August, selling 10,671 units, a 19% increase year-over-year. The growth was primarily fueled by the Mustang Mach-E, which saw sales surge over 35% to 7,226 units following a recent model refresh that added features and cut costs. The F-150 Lightning also saw a 21% increase in sales. Ford is supporting the transition to EVs by offering complimentary home chargers and installation, a unique initiative aimed at improving customer experience. With a new $30,000 all-electric truck planned for 2027, the company is betting on continued momentum in the EV market.</p>

          <p>Amid soaring housing costs, a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are teaming up with friends or relatives to purchase homes. With national home prices up 56% since 2020, co-buying allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome the significant affordability gap, which is especially challenging for single buyers. Recent housing industry reports indicate that about 15% of homebuyers purchased with a non-romantic partner. While this strategy provides a path to homeownership and companionship, it also requires careful legal planning, as friends lack the built-in property protections that married couples have, necessitating detailed co-ownership agreements.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has described China as being only "nanoseconds behind" the United States in semiconductor technology, emphasizing the need for American companies to compete vigorously in the global market, including in China. Speaking on a podcast, Huang highlighted China's deep talent pool, strong work ethic, and vibrant internal competition as key factors in its rapid technological advancement. He argued that allowing U.S. tech firms to compete globally maximizes America's economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang also expressed his hope that Beijing will maintain an open market, as it serves China's best interest to have foreign companies investing and competing domestically.</p>
