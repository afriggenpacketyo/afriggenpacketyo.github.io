          <p>The UK government has unveiled the first electric vehicle (EV) models qualifying for a new £3,750 discount under its grant scheme, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among the initial models to receive the maximum discount, with 26 other models eligible for £1,500 off, for new cars costing up to £37,000. This initiative, part of a £650 million, three-year scheme, seeks to make EVs more affordable, addressing a key barrier for many drivers. The government aims to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030, while also promoting sustainable manufacturing practices for higher discounts.</p>

          <p>Pure Storage shares surged over 30% to a record high after the data storage vendor reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year guidance. Wall Street reacted positively to the early success of Pure's agreement with Meta, secured in March, making Pure a 'key storage provider' for the social media giant. The company has already begun recognizing revenue from Meta deployments, expressing confidence in exceeding initial deployment targets due to its cost and energy-efficient technology. CEO Charles Giancarlo highlighted Pure's growing appeal to hyperscalers seeking to optimize storage for burgeoning artificial intelligence needs, contributing to its $26 billion market cap.

          <p>Kim Harvey, a veteran producer, has been named the new executive producer for 'CBS Evening News,' replacing Guy Campanile, as the program continues to struggle with declining viewership. This leadership change signals potential broader shifts, including a possible return to a single anchor and a more traditional news format, following a recent revamp that failed to gain traction against competitors. Harvey, who has been with the program since 2017 and previously worked at CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC, is expected to bring a sharp news sense and strong newsroom relationships to her new role. The future of CBS News is under scrutiny after its parent company, Paramount Global, was acquired by Skydance Media.</p>

          <p>Despite initial market jitters following Nvidia's latest earnings report, rallies in related stocks like GE Vernova, Eaton, and Broadcom indicate that concerns about slowing Nvidia growth might be misplaced. While Nvidia's stock faced slight pressure due to high expectations, these portfolio members saw positive gains, signaling continued confidence in the AI trade. Experts suggest that if there were serious concerns about Nvidia's deceleration, weakness would be more widespread across the board. This market resilience, coupled with an upward revision of Q2 GDP to 3.3%, suggests a robust economic environment despite various challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

This action ensures that lower automobile tariffs will be applied retroactively from August 1. The European Commission stated that these steps, which also include preferential market access for some US seafood and agricultural goods, aim to restore stability and predictability in transatlantic trade relations. The proposal, which now requires approval from the European Parliament and Council, follows a deal reached in late July, where President Trump indicated a 15% tariff on most European goods to the US, including cars.</p>

          <p>Mexico is reportedly preparing to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, including automobiles, textiles, and plastics, as part of its 2026 budget proposal. This potential trade shift comes amidst urging from US President Donald Trump, who advocates for a 'Fortress North America' to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains. Trump has criticized existing trade 'loopholes' in the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, specifically targeting Chinese carmakers establishing plants in Mexico to export to the US. Mexico's imports from China exceeded $51 billion last year, representing nearly one-fifth of its total foreign purchases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a robust 3.3% annualized pace in the second quarter, exceeding initial estimates and consensus forecasts, according to the Commerce Department. This stronger-than-expected growth was primarily driven by increased consumer spending and business resilience against tariff volatility. A key metric, final sales to private domestic purchasers, also saw a significant jump, indicating healthy domestic demand. Despite the unusual impact of tariffs on trade numbers, the economy has grown about 2.1% in the first half of the year, with analysts predicting continued, albeit slower, growth.

This experiment follows a previous, less cost-effective attempt using live rabbits.

          <p>This article re-evaluates the concept of diversity in business, arguing that while traditional DEI programs focusing on innate attributes like race and gender have faced criticism, cognitive and ideological diversity are crucial for organizational success. Research suggests that teams with diverse experiences, skills, and opinions, particularly those combining different creative and ideological viewpoints, are more effective and innovative. The author provides three pointers for companies to pursue truly profitable diversity: moving beyond demographic proxies, prioritizing candidates with high openness to new ideas, and embracing political diversity to guard against groupthink. Cultivating curiosity about differing beliefs is presented as a key to achieving this.</p>

The new proposals suggest allowing an average of 182 days let over several years and counting up to 14 charity days towards the target.
