          <p>New Manchester City signing Tijjani Reijnders made a remarkable Premier League debut, contributing a goal and an assist in a decisive 4-0 win against Wolves. The 27-year-old Dutch midfielder showcased the dynamic, box-to-box style that made him a key player for AC Milan, immediately making an impact for Pep Guardiola's squad. Reijnders' performance, alongside goals from Erling Haaland, demonstrated City's intent to rebound from a disappointing previous season. The victory provides an optimistic start as the team aims to re-establish its dominance in the league while awaiting the return of key players like Rodri and Phil Foden.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. Trump stated that the goal is to move directly to a comprehensive peace agreement rather than a ceasefire, which he claims often fails. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and European leaders, where Trump reportedly relayed that Putin might offer concessions. This direct engagement marks a significant step in the administration's efforts to broker an end to the nearly two-year-long war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised President Trump's diplomatic efforts, stating they have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. The statement came after the Alaska summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin, which did not result in a formal ceasefire but paved the way for further talks. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet Trump in Washington. The UK leader also reaffirmed that Western allies will continue to apply economic pressure on Russia until a just and lasting peace is achieved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are strongly advising adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. The fish is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol, raise 'good' HDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation throughout the body. According to Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, these benefits contribute to healthier blood vessels and help maintain heart muscle function. Experts recommend consuming at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>

          <p>Fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the relaunch of standalone physical stores, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, recently held its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling its intent to reclaim its former cultural relevance. While leveraging nostalgia for its 2000s heyday, industry experts caution that Topshop must also attract a new generation of shoppers and compete in a market now dominated by fast-fashion giants like Shein. The brand's management is confident they can fill a gap in the market with their distinct 'London girl' aesthetic and quality products.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week at record highs, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected July inflation report. The data increased speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. However, momentum slowed late in the week after the producer price index showed a rise in wholesale inflation. Despite mixed signals, market odds for a rate cut remain high, and several major companies, including Goldman Sachs, Nvidia, and Meta, reached all-time high stock prices during the week's trading sessions.

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup, Steel + Spark, is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" units, where four containers are joined in an X-shape to form 20 individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The project emphasizes using existing materials to reduce costs and environmental impact, with each unit taking only about a week to construct. The initiative aims to provide a scalable solution to the affordable housing crisis, offering residents a secure and private space to rebuild their lives.</p>
