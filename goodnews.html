          <p>Amidst the Trump administration's actions regarding international student enrollment at Harvard, Jamie Beaton advises students to remain focused on their goals. Despite the political turmoil, Beaton suggests that prospective students, especially those from abroad, might find an advantage in applying during this period. Harvard's brand remains strong, and the temporary disruption could lead some applicants to consider other institutions, potentially easing competition. The situation is understandably causing anxiety among students, but the long-term value of a Harvard education is likely to endure, according to Beaton.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed regulations regarding cryptocurrency investments in 401(k) plans, reversing guidance from the Biden era that cautioned against such investments due to fraud and loss risks.
