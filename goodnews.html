          <p>Small colleges like Roanoke College are reviving their football programs after decades of absence in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men, whose college attendance rates have been declining. While administrators see an immediate influx of student-athletes and a boost in campus spirit, research indicates these enrollment spikes are often temporary. The trend highlights a broader strategy among educational institutions to attract male students and enhance campus life, even as the long-term effectiveness of using athletics for recruitment remains debated.</p>

The article suggests that parents should learn about AI alongside their children, use the tools together to evaluate responses, and teach critical thinking skills like fact-checking. While acknowledging AI's potential as a learning aid, it also highlights dangers, such as chatbots providing unsafe advice on serious mental health issues, underscoring the need for clear household rules and boundaries.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region early Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a relatively shallow depth. While the Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat, it was later rescinded. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the seismic event in the sparsely populated region.</p>

The ruling orders Meta to review and clarify its terms of use, emphasizing that social media posts are constitutionally protected and any limitations must be proportionate and transparent.</p>

          <p>England and Scotland are set to face each other in a Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final, renewing a rivalry that has been overwhelmingly dominated by England for over 25 years. Scotland has not defeated England since 1999, a gap attributed to England's early investment, larger player pool, and more developed professional pathways. Despite the historical disparity and recent turmoil surrounding the Scottish team's coaching and contracts, there is a sense of belief within the squad as they prepare to challenge the heavily favored Red Roses at Ashton Gate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The highly anticipated boxing match between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford has experts offering conflicting predictions for the outcome. One perspective favors Crawford, citing his superior technical skill, adaptability, and a potential decline in Canelo's performance, suggesting he could win on points despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, the other argument supports Canelo, emphasizing his significant size and power advantage at the 168lb limit and questioning if Crawford can withstand the punishment from a naturally larger, stronger fighter. The fight's intrigue lies in this clash of elite skill versus physical advantage.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption demonstrations known as the "GenZ" protests, calm is returning to Nepal's capital as former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki was sworn in as the nation's first female interim prime minister. The youth-led uprising, fueled by economic frustrations and a government ban on social media, led to the collapse of the previous administration. In one of her first acts, the new prime minister recommended dissolving parliament and setting new elections for March 5, a move approved by the president.</p>
