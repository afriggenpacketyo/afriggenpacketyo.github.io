          <h2>Tesco Installs AI Cameras at Self-Checkouts to Combat Shoplifting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 03:48:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts, sparking mixed reactions from shoppers. The technology aims to reduce shoplifting by identifying when items aren't scanned properly, showing a replay to the customer. While some customers mocked the "VAR-style" cameras, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance and vowed to avoid self-checkouts. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK, with retailers reporting millions of thefts costing billions of pounds annually, prompting supermarkets like Sainsbury's to adopt similar AI recognition systems to enhance security and checkout efficiency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over ¬£70 million in response to a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. The scandal emerged during the cost of living crisis when firms switched struggling customers to prepayment, sometimes forcibly entering homes; a new code of practice now has stricter conditions for such installations. While Energy UK defended involuntary installations as a last resort, Citizens Advice emphasized the need for quick compensation for affected consumers.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting in as many weeks. The visit highlights Merz's focus on the war in Ukraine and his efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies, particularly amid concerns about weakening U.S. support for NATO. Discussions between Zelensky and Merz are expected to center on continued military assistance, including the potential export of the Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden. Merz has emphasized his support for Ukraine and the use of sanctions to pressure Russia into a cease-fire, contrasting with the initially cooler relationship between Zelensky and the previous German chancellor.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but failed to complete its return to Earth during its ninth test flight. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up during re-entry into the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean. Although several planned tests were not conducted, the company fixed ascent issues from previous flights and flew a booster used in an earlier test flight. Elon Musk stated that the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, but acknowledged progress on Starship has been slower than promised, particularly for its role as the lunar lander for NASA's Artemis III mission.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to provide lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas amid surging retail rice prices. This decision follows a suspension of orders from major retailers to allocate the remaining rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that efforts will continue to ensure reserve rice reaches people in rural areas, with a purchase limit imposed on large retailers. The government aims to ease household frustrations as retail rice prices have doubled from the previous year, after earlier attempts to rein in prices through auctions failed.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use, prompting debate on drug policy. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and regulating it under the Psychoactive Substances Act. Khan supports the report's findings, arguing current rules "cannot be justified" and calling for better education and policing of cannabis use. Critics argue decriminalization would send the wrong message about the harm associated with cannabis.</p>
