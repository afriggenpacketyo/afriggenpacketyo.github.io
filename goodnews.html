          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi revealed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) Development Strategy until 2035, a comprehensive 10-year plan designed to foster a multipolar global order. Emerging from a recent summit, this strategy aims to set a clear direction for the bloc, emphasizing multilateralism and collective security in response to escalating geopolitical tensions. Wang highlighted the SCO's unified stance against unilateral actions, implicitly referencing the United States, and its advocacy for a WTO-centered multilateral trading mechanism to counter perceived "bullying." The organization, encompassing nearly half the global population, seeks to solidify its influence as a major platform for international cooperation and stability in the coming decade.</p>

          <p>European countries are developing "precise plans" for international military deployments in Ukraine, intended as security guarantees if a peace agreement ends the ongoing war with Russia. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that President Trump has assured an "American presence" as a "backstop" for this multinational force, though the U.S. has previously suggested a coordination role rather than ground troops. The Kremlin has rejected any Western military presence in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, maintaining a negative stance on NATO interference. These plans underscore the urgent desire for a lasting peace, but also the complexities and deep divisions surrounding Ukraine's future security.</p>

          <p>The aurora borealis, or northern lights, are anticipated to be visible across 18 U.S. states tonight, following a coronal mass ejection from the sun over the weekend. This solar event is expected to impact Earth's magnetic field, creating a colorful display for skygazers. While not as intense as the strongest geomagnetic storm in 2024, this offers a significant opportunity for many to witness the phenomenon since spring. The peak of the geomagnetic storm is forecast for early Tuesday morning, with optimal viewing conditions in dark areas away from city lights, offering a rare celestial spectacle.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to actively counter "unilateral bullying," a clear reference to U.S. sanctions and trade tariffs, during a recent summit. Xi emphasized the need for the SCO to become a major platform for multilateralism and collective security, advocating for a WTO-centered global trading mechanism. He also called for the swift establishment of an SCO-backed lender to strengthen economic cooperation among member states. This push for greater self-reliance and unity within the bloc comes as U.S. economic pressures continue to impact China and its allies, highlighting the ongoing geopolitical and economic rivalry.</p>

          <p>A Polish CEO, Piotr Szczerek, has issued a public apology for snatching a hat from a young boy at the US Open, an incident that went viral and sparked widespread criticism. Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was passing the hat to him, not the child. He expressed regret for hurting the boy and disappointing fans, confirming he has since returned the hat. Majchrzak, the tennis star involved, later reunited with the boy, gifting him new merchandise and acknowledging the confusion.

          <p>ScotRail has permanently scrapped peak rail fares, eliminating higher prices for weekday travel during busy periods across Scotland. This initiative, championed by the Scottish Greens and announced by First Minister John Swinney, aims to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, offering significant financial savings for passengers. For example, Edinburgh to Glasgow peak fares will be nearly 50% cheaper. Although a previous trial had limited success in self-financing, the Scottish government-owned operator is investing £40-45 million annually, hoping to grow its commuter base and deliver environmental benefits. The move simplifies ticketing and is widely welcomed by passengers struggling with the cost of living.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs), particularly six-month terms, currently offer the biggest returns for savers in September 2025. While CD rates have slightly declined from their peaks, they remain competitive, with many short-term options still yielding 4% or higher. This trend is attributed to uncertainty in the rate environment and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, making shorter terms more attractive for liquidity and higher APYs. Some medium-term CDs also present good returns, and a CD ladder strategy, combining various terms, is recommended for long-term wealth preservation and interest rate risk mitigation.

The research, which compared shipment sizes, tariff rates, and price changes, suggests that the average price of goods imported from China dropped only 2.4% against a 27 percentage point tariff increase.

          <p>The article advocates for electric vehicle (EV) drivers in California to charge their cars at the office during midday, arguing it's the cheapest and cleanest time due to abundant solar energy. While overnight charging still reduces emissions, daytime charging can slash them by an additional 80%, utilizing energy that might otherwise be squandered. UC San Diego's large-scale experiment shows that informing drivers can shift behavior, but stronger incentives like dynamic electricity pricing and expanded workplace charging networks are needed. Policymakers are urged to focus on network quality and function, alongside improving price structures, to fully leverage EVs for emissions reduction and grid efficiency.</p>
