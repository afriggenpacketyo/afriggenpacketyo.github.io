          <h2>Offshore Yuan Rises Amid Expectations of Easing US-China Trade Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China‚Äôs offshore yuan has surged to a six-month high, breaking past the 7.2 level against the US dollar, fueled by expectations of a potential rollback of tariffs. This shift in market sentiment is driven by hopes that the US and China will soon begin trade negotiations, potentially easing trade war tensions. However, analysts caution that these negotiations will be lengthy and uncertain, which could bring volatility to the exchange rate. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and await tangible signs of China's ability to withstand US challenges.</p>

          <p>A World War II-era Philippine navy ship, intended as a target in a joint U.S.-Philippine military exercise, sank unexpectedly hours before the drill, leading to its cancellation. The BRP Miguel Malvar, decommissioned in 2021, succumbed to rough seas while being towed. Despite this, other live-fire maneuvers proceeded off Zambales. The cancelled ship-sinking drill was meant to take place near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a point of contention with China, highlighting ongoing tensions in the South China Sea. The incident underscores the complexities of military exercises in contested regions.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Claim Ancient Star Catalogue Is World's Oldest</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Chinese scientists propose that ‚ÄúShi‚Äôs Star Catalogue,‚Äù an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world‚Äôs oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335BC. This claim challenges the current recognition of the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece as the oldest. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observations. This finding suggests that detailed study of the night sky began in China around the same time as in Greece.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, coming in an array of shapes, sizes and colours. The team said in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Plants on April 4 that as the most successfully domesticated ancient ornamental plants, roses have been regarded as a symbol of love and beauty from antiquity to modern times.</p>

          <p>The authors argue that China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States in a variety of technologies, notably at the A.I. frontier. And it has developed a real edge in how it disseminates, commercializes and manufactures tech. History has shown us that those who adopt and diffuse a technology the fastest wins. China has chosen to forcefully retaliate against America‚Äôs recent tariffs. To win the race for the future of technology, and in turn the war for global leadership, we must discard the belief that America is always ahead.</p>
