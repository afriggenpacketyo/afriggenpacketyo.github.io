          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave has announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds to support general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May that was significantly oversubscribed, signaling strong investor confidence in the company's AI-focused strategy. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, the company, which serves major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its share price more than triple since its public debut.

          <p>A SkyWest pilot performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military plane was on a converging course and had not been announced by air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport. The flight, with 76 passengers, landed safely after the go-around, and passengers applauded the pilot's calm handling of the surprise encounter. The FAA and the Air Force are now investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The expansion, approved by the Greater London Authority, includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful due to heritage protections on the site, but the judge ruled the planning decision was rationally exercised. </p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines will officially end its long-standing open seating policy on January 27, introducing assigned seats for the first time in its history.

          <p>Some animals in human care, such as zoo elephants, pigs, and light-colored pets, require sunscreen to prevent sunburn and skin cancer, issues their wild counterparts often avoid through evolutionary adaptations or behavior. Zookeepers and veterinarians apply specialized or human-grade sunblock to sensitive areas on animals that cannot adequately protect themselves, particularly those in habitats or latitudes different from their native ones. This practice highlights a unique challenge in modern animal care, balancing an animal's well-being with the difficulty of applying protection to creatures not naturally inclined to accept it.</p>

          <p>As certificates of deposit (CDs) opened during the 2023-2024 high-rate period begin to mature, financial experts warn savers against common missteps. Key mistakes to avoid include automatically renewing the CD at a potentially lower rate without shopping around, and chasing the highest available rate without considering if the term length aligns with personal financial goals. Savers are advised to use the maturity date as an opportunity to reassess their financial situation and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts for better flexibility and competitive returns.

          <p>Child development experts argue that parents often make the mistake of thwarting a young child's natural desire to help with household chores, which can hinder their development. By prioritizing speed and neatness over participation, or by micromanaging, parents can discourage enthusiasm for contributing to the family. Researchers suggest that involving children in real household tasks, even if imperfectly done, helps build motor skills, confidence, and a sense of responsibility. Turning chores into a shared social activity is recommended to foster a culture of helpfulness.</p>
