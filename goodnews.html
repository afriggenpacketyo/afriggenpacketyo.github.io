          <p>After years of index fund dominance, active management is experiencing a resurgence in the ETF market. Recent data shows net inflows into active equity ETFs, contrasting with outflows from index funds. This shift signifies a potential transformation in the ETF landscape, with a record number of new ETFs launched this year, many of which are actively managed. Experts emphasize the importance of investors remaining invested during market volatility and identifying funds that take a unique approach to stock picking (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Residents of a town in Texas, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX facility, voted to rename the town "Starbase" and formally organize it as a city. The move separates the town from Cameron County, which had previously rejected plans for more housing for SpaceX employees. The new city will now have control over building and permitting processes, allowing it to pursue construction projects more easily. Critics, however, voice concerns over the potential environmental impact of further development in the area.</p>

          <p>French police rescued the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur in a nighttime raid after he was kidnapped for ransom, marking the latest in a series of alleged criminal efforts targeting individuals involved in digital assets. The victim was kidnapped in Paris, and investigators located him in a house south of the city. Police detained five people and are investigating potential charges including kidnapping with torture.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This phrase, regardless of the specific person mentioned, conveys a message of inadequacy and undermines a partner's sense of worth. The root cause of using this phrase is often a fear of open communication and a lack of emotional safety within the relationship. The psychologist suggests a more direct and compassionate approach to expressing needs and frustrations.</p>

          <p>Recent media reports suggest widespread dissatisfaction among the U.S. workforce, characterized by terms like "quiet quitting" and "rage applying." However, these reports are often based on limited surveys conducted by HR firms with specific agendas. The article argues that many people are generally content with their jobs and understand the challenges employers face. It also suggests that dissatisfaction can be a positive driver for personal and professional growth, and that the media is exaggerating the degree to which US workers are unhappy.</p>
