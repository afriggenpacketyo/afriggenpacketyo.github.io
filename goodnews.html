          <p>Real estate mogul and "Shark Tank" star Barbara Corcoran has candidly shared a detailed list of the cosmetic procedures she has undergone to maintain her appearance. In a recent social media post, she listed treatments including three facelifts, an eye lift, and regular fillers and laser resurfacing. The article features commentary from plastic surgeons who have not treated her but applaud her transparency, noting that her results appear natural and reflect a modern approach to aesthetic maintenance that is becoming increasingly common and openly discussed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience as employers added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding economists' expectations and keeping pace with the average monthly gain over the past year. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Growth was primarily driven by state and local government hiring, while the federal workforce continued to shrink. This strong jobs report suggests the Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting interest rates as it monitors the economic impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the fifth consecutive week, average mortgage rates have fallen, with a 30-year fixed-rate loan now at 6.67%, offering a glimmer of hope for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend could continue, especially with market expectations of a Federal Reserve benchmark rate cut later this year. In light of these developments, the article advises that potential buyers should act now to prepare for a potentially more competitive market by checking their credit reports, researching real estate agents, and securing a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen their position.

          <p>A new documentary on celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa is critiqued as feeling more like a slick commercial for his global brand than an insightful portrait of the chef himself. The review suggests that while the film touches upon Matsuhisa's meticulous standards, his rise to fame, and his celebrity investors like Robert De Niro, it ultimately lacks depth. It fails to fully explore the revolutionary aspects of his cuisine or the intimate, communal experience of dining, making it less compelling than other notable food-focused documentaries.</p>

          <p>Actor John Leguizamo is launching the second season of his docuseries, "Leguizamo Does America," which explores the diverse stories and contributions of Latino communities across the United States. Premiering on MSNBC, the new season arrives in a changed political landscape under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.

          <p>This article outlines five key warning signs that a person's credit card debt has become too overwhelming for a do-it-yourself payoff strategy. These red flags include only being able to afford minimum payments, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, using credit cards for essential living expenses like groceries, and having a debt-to-income ratio above 40%. When these signs are present, it indicates that the debt is unsustainable, and the article suggests exploring professional debt relief options like credit counseling or debt settlement programs.</p>
