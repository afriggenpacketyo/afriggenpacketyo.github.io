          <p>India and the European Union are actively progressing towards finalizing a free trade agreement by the end of the year, driven by mutual economic opportunities and global trade pressures, including US tariffs on India. This strategic partnership aims to diversify supply chains, reduce India's dependency on volatile markets, and enhance the EU's geopolitical standing in the Indo-Pacific. Negotiations still face challenges regarding tariff reductions on specific goods and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, but political engagement signals a strong commitment to a breakthrough. The agreement is seen as crucial for both economies amidst shifting global dynamics.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that President Trump's willingness to ban TikTok in the U.S. was the crucial factor in China agreeing to a deal framework for the app's U.S. operations. Bessent explained that commercial terms had been established months prior, but China only advanced after Trump's strong tariff announcement, signaling a shift in leverage. The administration emphasizes national security as paramount, even as the White House maintains its own TikTok account, reflecting a complex approach to the platform's future. The September 17th divestment deadline looms, though an extension is possible, as negotiations continue to unfold.</p>

His aircraft was engaged by enemy planes, and he was subsequently listed as missing in action, with his family holding out hope for his survival. In 2019, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency exhumed unidentified remains from Japan, using advanced dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis to confirm Mandeberg's identity. His family was briefed in March 2025, and he was laid to rest in Livonia, Michigan, on September 14th.</p>
