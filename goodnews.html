          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes in the area. Police suspect arson as the cause of the fire at a substation in a nearby village. Despite the disruption, the festival organizers ensured the closing ceremony proceeded as planned by switching to an alternative electricity supply. Morning screenings were briefly interrupted while the supply was switched to generators. The incident caused traffic issues and shop closures in the glitzy resort town.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman. This would end 17 years of federal control over the entities that guarantee trillions of dollars in mortgages. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn this could benefit investors at the expense of homebuyers. The White House states that any actions will be carefully evaluated to strengthen the Federal Housing Finance Agency and promote homeownership. The article explains the history and function of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the potential implications of privatization.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article accuses broadcast networks of bias in their coverage of political books, favoring "tell-all" books about Trump while downplaying those about Biden. The article contrasts the extensive coverage given to anti-Trump books like Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged" with the limited attention paid to a new Biden "tell-all" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. The author asserts that networks aggressively pushed the White House line that questioning Biden‚Äôs fitness was a MAGA talking point, neglecting to press the issue of media spin.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, marking a significant advancement in underwater communication technology. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This milestone could pave the way for the real-life use of long-range undersea messaging, with profound civilian and military applications. The feat was detailed in a May study published in Acta Acustica, China‚Äôs premier acoustic journal.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain due to a rare condition called pericardial constriction, where the sac around the heart thickens and prevents it from fully opening. Doctors initially struggled to diagnose the cause of his swelling and fatigue. Cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition and performed open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis and remove the thickened pericardium. Mauceri recovered and returned to conducting, expressing gratitude for the medical team's intervention. He now feels like he is in the best shape since college.</p>

          <p>While the "defund the police" movement faced backlash, some cities are seeing progress in public safety through alternative approaches. Milwaukee redirected police funding to affordable housing and youth programming, while Seattle invested in participatory budgeting and launched a third public safety department focused on mental health crises. Austin increased investment in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. Organizers say these efforts have sparked conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety, despite challenges and shifting public sentiment. They hope the Trump administration's emphasis on law enforcement will inspire renewed interest in alternatives to policing.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week of remote work. This is above the international average of 1.3 days. Hybrid working has become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. The popularity of home working in the UK is attributed to the cost and length of commuting. Despite some companies implementing return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized since 2023. A separate poll found that less than half of workers would comply with a full-time return to the office.</p>
