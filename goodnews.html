        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a sharp decline in April as President Trump's global tariffs began to significantly impact imports. This shift indicates a potential recalibration of international trade dynamics in response to the implemented tariffs. The decrease in trade activity reflects the intended consequences of the tariffs, which aimed to reduce imports and stimulate domestic production. However, the long-term effects on the U.S. economy and its trade relationships remain to be seen, as these policies continue to evolve and adapt to global economic conditions. The changing trade landscape will likely influence future economic strategies and international negotiations. Optimism score is based on the potential for domestic economic growth, though tempered by potential global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Thursday, according to Beijing, initiating hopes of breaking the trade talk stalemate. Investors reacted positively, opening stocks higher, as the impasse between the two economic superpowers weighs on Trump's tariff regime. Washington and Beijing temporarily lowered tariffs after talks in Switzerland last month, but this agreement is now threatened. The Trump administration accuses Beijing of slow-walking critical mineral exports, while China expresses frustration with new restrictions on student visas and warnings against using Chinese semiconductors. The phone call represents an attempt to de-escalate trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Morgan Stanley analysts suggest AI could exacerbate deflation by disrupting the job market, especially given high youth unemployment. However, Standard Chartered's Ding Shuang argues that overcapacity and weak domestic demand are the main drivers of deflation, and China should not hesitate to develop AI due to deflation concerns.
