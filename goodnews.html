          <p>As President Donald Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the event casts a spotlight on his own family's immigrant story. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was a native Gaelic speaker from the Isle of Lewis in Scotland who emigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. This background presents a notable contrast to his administration's hardline stance on what it terms "chain migration," the very process that allowed his maternal family to establish roots in America. The article explores the culture of emigration from the economically challenged Scottish island and the "rags to riches" trajectory of Trump's mother.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing US-China trade tensions, Hong Kong's government-run tech incubator, Cyberport, is considering incorporating Chinese-made graphics processing units (GPUs) into its new Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre. The move is a strategic effort to decrease its reliance on chips from the American firm Nvidia, which currently powers its entire 3,000 petaflop system. Cyberport's CEO confirmed they are testing GPUs from four different mainland Chinese manufacturers, stating that depending solely on Nvidia is no longer a viable option given the strained geopolitical climate. The final decision on which Chinese GPUs to procure will be based on performance and cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its cooperation with Central Asian nations to secure access to critical minerals and rare earths, creating a wider gap with the United States in the race for these strategic resources. Recent agreements, such as one between China National Gold Group and Uzbekistan, highlight Beijing's proactive, region-wide strategy to invest in geological exploration and mining infrastructure. These moves are seen as an effort to counter China's dependency on other sources and limit the influence of Western actors in a region rich with materials vital for high-tech industries. The article suggests that China's approach is more adaptive to the strategic needs of each Central Asian country.</p>

          <p>A primary school in Heihe, a Chinese city bordering Russia, has experienced a notable surge in enrollment from Russian children, reflecting deepening people-to-people ties between the two countries. This year, 127 new Russian students joined the school, bringing the total to 216, many of whom commute daily across the border. The school has facilitated this exchange by arranging dedicated cross-border transportation and translation services for families. This development is seen as a tangible outcome of the strengthening relationship between Moscow and Beijing, fostering cultural integration at a local level amidst a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A species of ladybird never before recorded in the United Kingdom, the Little Arboreal Ladybird, has been discovered in the New Forest. Typically found in continental Europe, the insect's arrival is attributed to the warming climate and hot summer weather, which likely enabled its journey across the English Channel. Experts note that this is part of a broader trend of winged insects colonizing southern England as temperatures rise. The discovery highlights the tangible effects of climate change on biodiversity, with scientists encouraging the public to welcome these new species as they will likely become a key part of the region's ecosystem in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>As Ireland prepares for its presidential election on October 24th, the list of candidates seeking to succeed the popular two-term president, Michael D Higgins, is becoming clearer. So far, three candidates have secured the necessary nominations to appear on the ballot: independent Catherine Connolly, former Gaelic football manager Jim Gavin, and former cabinet minister Heather Humphreys. The main opposition party, Sinn Féin, has yet to decide if it will field its own candidate or endorse an existing one. The role of president is largely ceremonial but holds significant influence, with the winner serving a seven-year term as the nation's head of state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK will feature a significant "royal charm offensive," with the British government hoping to leverage his admiration for the monarchy to advance its diplomatic goals. The meticulously planned visit will immerse the president in royal pageantry, including a lavish banquet and events with King Charles III and other senior royals. This strategy aims to create a positive atmosphere for discussing sensitive topics like trade and the war in Ukraine. Analysts note that while the King and Trump hold divergent views on many issues, the monarch's experience and Trump's fascination with royalty could serve as a unique diplomatic tool for the UK.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has announced an initial investment of AU$12 billion (US$8 billion) to upgrade the Henderson shipyard near Perth into a facility capable of maintaining a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. This major expenditure is a key component of the AUKUS security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which aims to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. The upgraded shipyard will be crucial for servicing the Virginia-class submarines Australia is set to acquire from the US and the new AUKUS-class submarines to be built with the UK. The facility will also be available for use by the US Navy.</p>
