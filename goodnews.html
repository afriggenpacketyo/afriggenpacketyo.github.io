          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension due to controversial remarks about Charlie Kirk's death. Kimmel expressed that it was never his intention to make light of Kirk's murder or blame any specific group for the actions of the shooter. He acknowledged that his comments may have been ill-timed or unclear to some, understanding why people were upset. Kimmel emphasized the importance of free speech and the ability to have a show like his in a country that allows it, contrasting it with countries where comedians face imprisonment for criticizing those in power. The comedian's return included a video appearance by Robert De Niro portraying an aggressive FCC chair. Optimism here is based on the fact that the First Amendment is being actively discussed and freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding plans to increase its capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure beyond the initially allocated 380 billion yuan over the next three years. CEO Eddie Wu Yongming announced that Alibaba's cloud unit aims to become the world’s leading full-stack AI service provider, covering computing power to models. This pledge aligns with the surging demand for AI services and the increasingly clear technology trajectory from AI agents to AGI (artificial general intelligence) and ASI (artificial super intelligence). Wu emphasized that AGI would be a new beginning, potentially saving humans from 80% of existing jobs and creating super scientists and engineers to solve global issues. The high optimism is due to the focus on technological advancement and its potential benefits.</p>

          <p>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company is evaluating a major fundraising round from key investors, potentially valuing the crypto company at $500 billion. The funds are intended to maximize the scale of Tether's strategy across existing and new business lines, including stablecoins, AI, commodity trading, and energy. The company is also furthering plans to return to the U.S., reflecting a pro-crypto stance from President Trump. The transaction would involve new equity rather than existing investors selling their stakes, and talks are still in an early stage. The optimism is high, reflecting the company's growth and future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 22:53:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations stated that an escalator used by Donald Trump stopped abruptly due to a safety mechanism, likely triggered by his videographer. The videographer, traveling backwards to film Trump's arrival with First Lady Melania Trump, may have inadvertently activated the mechanism at the top of the escalator. This explanation contradicts earlier White House concerns that someone deliberately stopped the escalator. Trump humorously referenced the incident during his UN speech, and a UN official clarified that the White House operated the teleprompter, which also malfunctioned. The optimism is neutral, reflecting the resolution of a minor technical issue.</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw defended his decision to miss a game with playoff implications to attend a memorial for Charlie Kirk.

          <p>Donald Trump stated that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with the support of Europe and NATO, due to pressures on Russia's economy. This marks a major shift in his position on the war with Russia, coming after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump's previous warnings suggested Ukraine would need to cede territory, which Zelensky has consistently rejected. Zelensky hailed this shift, noting the US is willing to provide security guarantees after the war is finished. The optimism score is relatively high, reflecting the potential for a positive turn in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed surprise at President Trump's assertion that Ukraine could regain all territory captured by Russia. Trump's comments came after a meeting with Zelenskyy and appear to mark a shift from his previous stance of expecting "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy said he believes Trump's position has changed and that Trump now understands that "we can't just swap territories. It's not fair." Trump had also met with Putin in Alaska, but criticized the Russian leader for continued strikes on Ukraine. The optimism is moderate, reflecting the unexpected change in Trump's perspective.</p>
