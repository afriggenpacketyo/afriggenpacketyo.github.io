          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death for the marsupials. Developed over a decade by the University of the Sunshine Coast, the vaccine aims to reduce the rapid spread of the disease, which causes blindness, infertility, and can lead to starvation. Researchers are optimistic this preventative measure, tested on hundreds of koalas, will significantly aid conservation efforts. The vaccine offers protection by reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and even reversing existing symptoms.</p>

Currently holding the third-best record among division champions, they face the prospect of playing in the first round rather than securing a bye. A key series against the Philadelphia Phillies will largely determine their fate, as they also contend with the San Diego Padres for the NL West title. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman emphasized the strategic advantage of a bye for World Series odds.</p>
