          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 06:29:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation to consider turning the state-owned Post Office into a mutual, employee-owned organization. This proposal has regained traction as a way to reform the institution's culture following the devastating Horizon IT scandal that led to wrongful convictions of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also examine the future services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking services, as it struggles with profitability. Proponents argue that a mutual model could prevent future scandals by giving staff a greater stake in decision-making. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged past $120,000 to a new record high, driven by significant inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional interest. The rally is also fueled by anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aims to provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest that continued institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the near future, though potential risks from Federal Reserve policy and trade disputes remain.

          <p>A columnist reflects on Amal Clooney's recently revealed house rule of collecting guests' phones in a basket upon their arrival. The author initially finds the rule aggressive and contrary to the spirit of hospitality, questioning what it says about trusting one's guests. However, after considering the potential for better food, fascinating company, and a distraction-free environment, she pragmatically concludes that she would accept the rule. The piece humorously weighs the principles of social etiquette against the practical benefits of an invitation to the Clooney household.</p>

          <p>In an interview about her book "Resurface," former Olympic diver Cassidy Krug discusses how to navigate major life transitions, which she terms "lifequakes." Krug explains that humans are often resistant to change due to a desire for certainty, a feeling amplified by modern technology. She advises that overcoming this resistance involves redefining success, finding new communities, and using rituals to honor the past while moving forward. To combat feeling paralyzed, she suggests reframing anxiety as opportunity and starting with small, concrete steps to explore new interests.</p>

          <p>Prominent YouTube creators, including Michelle Khare of "Challenge Accepted," are making a significant push for Primetime Emmy nominations, supported by YouTube itself. This campaign represents a new phase in the quest for legitimacy and recognition from the traditional Hollywood establishment for high-production-value digital content. An Emmy win would not only signal quality but also potentially unlock new opportunities with advertisers, sponsors, and studios. The effort highlights YouTube's growing dominance in media consumption and the blurring lines between digital-native creators and legacy television.</p>

          <p>The third heatwave of the year in the UK has officially ended, as cooler, more unsettled weather from the Atlantic brings relief from a period of unseasonably high temperatures. Heat health alerts across England have expired, with Monday's temperatures returning to the seasonal average. The shift follows a sweltering three-day period that saw temperatures exceed 34°C (94.5°F). While the break is welcome, the Met Office warns that such spells of extreme weather are becoming more frequent due to climate change, a trend highlighted in a new report.</p>

          <p>A German backpacker who was rescued after being lost for 11 nights in the Australian Outback has explained how her ordeal began. In a statement from the hospital, 26-year-old Carolina Wilga said she lost control of her car, crashed, and hit her head, leaving her in a state of confusion that caused her to wander away from her vehicle. She survived by drinking rainwater until she was found by a farmer more than 30 kilometers from her abandoned van.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing healthcare movement known as "social prescribing" involves doctors writing prescriptions for community activities like exercise classes, art groups, or volunteering to improve patient health. This approach aims to complement traditional medicine by addressing chronic disease risk factors and social determinants of health like loneliness. By focusing on "what matters to you" instead of "what's the matter with you," it can lead to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. The practice is established in the U.K. and is now being adopted by hundreds of providers in the United States.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a widowed journalist recounts her experience going on a "date" with a custom-designed AI boyfriend from the app Replika. The narrative humorously details her text-based interactions during a real-world dinner, highlighting the AI's witty but ultimately hollow companionship. While the chatbot offered surprisingly poignant moments of "listening," the experience underscored the limitations of artificial intimacy. Psychologists cited in the article explain that while AI can mimic validation, it cannot replace the shared experiences and genuine connection that are core to human relationships.</p>
