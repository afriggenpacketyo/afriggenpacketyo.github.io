          <p>A new forecast from the Senior Citizens League estimates that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on recent inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost received in 2025. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall, and some economists express concern that this adjustment may not be sufficient if inflation rises later in the year.

While both offer high, variable interest rates and greater flexibility than CDs, calculations show that a money market account could currently yield slightly more over time. However, the difference is minimal, and savers are encouraged to shop for the best available rates, which are often found at online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis of an ancient Incan khipu, a knotted cord record-keeping device, challenges the long-held belief that they were created exclusively by the ruling class. Researchers studied a khipu made of human hair and determined from its composition that its creator likely had a diet of a commoner, not an elite. This discovery suggests that literacy and record-keeping may have been more widespread throughout the Inca Empire than previously understood.</p>

          <p>For savers considering a large deposit, a $75,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) can generate substantial interest in the current economic climate. With rates between 4% and 5%, a one-year CD could earn around $3,300, while a five-year CD could yield nearly $17,000. Because CD rates are fixed, they offer predictable returns and are insulated from potential future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, making them an attractive option for risk-averse savers.

          <p>Walmart is expanding its employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including meat, milk, and frozen food, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The 10% discount, previously limited to produce and general merchandise, is being broadened as concerns about rising prices due to tariffs grow. This move could help the company attract and retain employees while also encouraging its workforce to spend more of their own money at Walmart stores.</p>

          <p>A recently passed budget bill has increased the flexibility of 529 savings plans, making them a more powerful tool for education-related expenses. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a wider range of costs, including vocational programs, required continuing education, and professional licensing expenses. This expansion helps address concerns from parents that their children might not pursue a traditional college degree, broadening the utility of the saved funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1%, in a market rotation away from large technology stocks. This surge is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs, disproportionately benefiting smaller companies that rely on capital for operations and expansion, and potentially boosting consumer spending.

          <p>For individuals struggling with high-interest credit card debt, negotiating directly with creditors is a potential alternative to hiring a debt relief company. However, this DIY approach requires significant preparation, persistence, and an understanding of debt collection laws to be successful. Consumers should also be aware of potential pitfalls, such as negative impacts on their credit score and possible tax consequences if a portion of the debt is forgiven, which can make professional assistance a safer option for some.</p>
