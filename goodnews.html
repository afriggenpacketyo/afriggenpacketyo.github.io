          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during a 45-minute phone call that upcoming bilateral tariff talks should be productive, with a potential in-person meeting at the Group of Seven summit in Canada next month. The call, initiated by the U.S., precedes further ministerial-level discussions in Washington led by Japan's top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. This comes amid escalating trade tensions between the two nations, emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial outcome. The discussions are set against a backdrop of recent economic data, including Japan's inflation acceleration in April and G7 finance chiefs demonstrating unity despite tariff disagreements.</p>

          <p>Operation Remount Corporation in Jay Em, Wyoming, offers equine therapy to veterans and first responders by pairing them with wild mustangs, many of whom have experienced trauma. The program aims to address mental health challenges such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which are more prevalent among veterans. Veteran Sean Walker, who served in Iraq and Bosnia, says the program and his horse, Spirit, have significantly impacted his reintegration into civilian life. The program also includes a new cabin built in honor of a Marine Corps Sgt. who struggled with the transition back to civilian life.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to pause in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and at the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama. FEMA initially halted on-site classes, citing that the government would no longer pay for travel for programs not deemed "mission critical." However, a comprehensive review led to the restoration of classes, acknowledging their effectiveness in training fire chiefs in leadership, management, and investigation techniques. The decision follows criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters, who argued that pausing training for first-responders was dangerous.</p>

Trump's offer of expedited resettlement for white South Africans in the U.S. as "refugees" has been met with jokes and satire, highlighting the legacy of apartheid and the ongoing inequality faced by Black people. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to address economic issues during his White House meeting, Trump continued to make false claims of genocide against white farmers. The jokes often stem from the perception that Afrikaners are used to a life of privilege made possible by Black workers.</p>

          <p>After an eight-year hiatus and drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s recovery from neck surgery, U2 is back in the studio creating new music. The band, speaking at the Ivor Novello Awards where they received the fellowship of the Ivors' songwriting academy, expressed excitement about rediscovering their chemistry and exploring new sonic territories. Bono emphasized that the "sound of the future" is their primary interest, and they intend to craft it themselves. The group also reflected on their beginnings in Dublin's punk scene and their journey to becoming one of the world's biggest bands.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway woke up to find a 135-meter container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, missing his house by mere meters. The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, went off course in Byneset, near Trondheim, while traveling through the Trondheim Fjord. No one was injured in the incident, and Norwegian police are investigating the cause of the crash. The ship had 16 people on board. The ship had previously run aground in 2023 but got free under its own power.</p>
