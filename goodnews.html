        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Operations at Copenhagen Airport have resumed after a nearly four-hour suspension caused by the sighting of several large, unidentified drones in the vicinity. The incident led to the diversion of at least 35 flights, and authorities have not yet determined the origin or type of the drones. Danish police have launched an investigation and will implement additional security measures, but they could not confirm or deny if the drones were of Russian origin. The airport has warned passengers to expect ongoing delays and cancellations following the disruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following childbirth, many couples experience a significant decrease in sexual desire, a topic recently highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth. Experts explain that this decline in libido is common and stems from a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustments to parenthood for both partners. The article emphasizes that the six-week postnatal check-up is not a mandatory timeline for resuming intimacy and encourages open communication between partners to alleviate pressure. Addressing these changes honestly is crucial for navigating the relationship's evolution after welcoming a child.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air after a nearly week-long suspension, stating the decision followed "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The suspension was enacted after Kimmel made jokes about the conservative reaction to the murder of influencer Charlie Kirk, which prompted threats from the FCC chairman and led major affiliate groups like Sinclair and Nexstar to drop the show. The network's initial decision sparked widespread criticism from free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and civil liberties groups, who condemned it as censorship under government pressure.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reversed his decision to boycott an ABC town hall after the network reinstated Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had initially withdrawn from the event to protest Kimmel's suspension, which he framed as corporate cowardice in the face of authoritarian pressure from the Trump administration. He argued that the suspension sent a chilling message about free speech to all Americans, not just the host and his staff. His participation is now back on, highlighting the political fallout and the intense debate over free speech sparked by the network's actions.</p>

          <p>The annual Fat Bear Week competition is underway, with voting open for the public to choose the brown bear that has best prepared for winter hibernation at Alaska's Katmai National Park. The contest, which began in 2014, highlights the importance of weight gain for the bears' survival, as they can add up to 700 pounds before their long winter fast. This year's bracket features 12 bears, including past contenders like 32 Chunk and newcomers like 602, nicknamed "Flow-tato." Fans can watch the bears live on webcams and vote daily online to crown the 2025 champion.</p>

          <p>NASA has unveiled its 2025 astronaut class, which for the first time includes more women than men, with six women and four men selected from over 8,000 applicants. The diverse group includes pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and Anna Menon, who previously flew to orbit on a private SpaceX mission. These candidates will undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The announcement comes at an uncertain time for the agency, facing budget cuts and a competitive race with China to return to the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>India is making a significant $18 billion push to establish a domestic semiconductor industry, aiming to reduce its reliance on imports and capture a larger share of the global electronics market. The "Semiconductor Mission" seeks to build a complete supply chain, from chip design to manufacturing and packaging, an ambitious goal for a late entrant to the field. While the government is offering generous incentives that have attracted partners like Taiwan's Powerchip, experts caution that success is not guaranteed. India must overcome challenges related to infrastructure, policy consistency, and creating a deep ecosystem to compete with established players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is calling for the government to offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research funding has been cut by the Trump administration. In a planned speech, Davey will argue that the UK should seize the opportunity to lead the world in cancer research by welcoming scientists affected by the US government's "anti-science agenda." This proposal is part of a broader political strategy by the Liberal Democrats to position themselves as staunch critics of President Trump and his allies. The party has not yet detailed the specific visa discounts it would propose.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market reaching new highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests there are still undervalued investment opportunities within the S&P 500.

Among his picks were T-Mobile in telecommunications, Royal Caribbean in travel, and several financial institutions like Capital One and American Express. Cramer also recommended tech names like Dell, citing its role in AI infrastructure, and industrial giants such as Caterpillar, suggesting these stocks are well-positioned for future growth.

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking many residents across the region. The quake was centered near Berkeley, and while it was widely felt, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system ran trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. Officials noted that while the event caused no major harm, it serves as a crucial reminder for residents in the earthquake-prone region to be prepared for the possibility of a much larger seismic event.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has formally accused Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr of engaging in unlawful intimidation of broadcasters to suppress speech critical of President Trump. In a letter, Bonta cited Carr's threats toward ABC's parent company Disney, which preceded the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," as a violation of the First Amendment. Bonta argued that Carr's actions create a chilling effect on free expression and demanded he cease his "campaign of censorship." While pleased that Kimmel's show is returning, Bonta stated his concerns remain about government officials using their power to silence disfavored speech.</p>
