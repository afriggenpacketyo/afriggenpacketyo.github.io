          <p>Members of Congress from both parties set aside political divisions to play in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, raising money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. The "Team Congress" players, which included both Democrats and Republicans, competed against a media team called the "Bad News Babes." Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor, the event highlights a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill for a common cause. Over its history, the game has successfully raised nearly $5 million for the charity.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have secured a three-year, $123 million contract extension with star pass rusher T.J. Watt, resolving a period of contract negotiations ahead of the upcoming NFL season. This deal reportedly makes Watt the highest-paid non-quarterback in the history of the league, surpassing the previous record set by Myles Garrett. Watt, the 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, had previously skipped mandatory minicamp, signaling his desire for a new contract. The agreement ensures the seven-time Pro Bowler remains a cornerstone of the Steelers' defense for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <h2>Scientists to Analyze 1.5-Million-Year-Old Ice Core to Uncover Ancient Climate Secrets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:18:22 EDT</div>

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK, where scientists will begin melting it to study Earth's past climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, this ancient ice contains trapped dust, volcanic ash, and microscopic algae that can reveal information about temperature, wind patterns, and sea levels from a previously unknown period. The research aims to understand a mysterious climate shift called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. This data could revolutionize climate change models by providing insights into how the planet responds to high levels of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <h2>UK to Implement Stricter Affordability Checks for Buy Now, Pay Later Services</h2>

          <p>New regulations in the UK, set to take effect next July, will require Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. This move by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees. As a result, some consumers may be denied credit, and the process of making impulse purchases could be slowed down. The new rules will also grant users the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and ensure clearer information about terms and conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he noticed mild swelling in his legs. In a memo, the president's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, described the condition as "benign and common," especially in individuals over 70, and stated it is not a serious health threat. The diagnosis followed a comprehensive examination, including ultrasounds, which ruled out more severe issues like deep vein thrombosis. The White House also addressed recent photos of bruising on the president's hand, attributing it to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use for cardiovascular prevention.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill creating a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protection and establish clear rules for the $250 billion market, defining which digital currencies can be classified as stablecoins. This move could pave the way for banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, potentially making them a more mainstream form of payment. The bill is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to support and regulate the growing digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that it would be "counterproductive" to continue the blockade after receiving guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply. The new sanctions package targets Russia's energy and banking sectors, including measures to further isolate Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system.</p>

Originally a 6-foot-1 guard in his native Switzerland, a growth spurt pushed him to the center position, but he retained his guard skills. The Clippers' coaching staff and management are encouraged by his rapid progress and see significant upside in the young, multilingual player's development.</p>

          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he spent his first 11 seasons. The deal includes a no-trade clause and comes after Lillard was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks. Lillard, who is expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from Achilles surgery, chose to return to Portland, where his family resides, despite interest from other playoff contenders. His return reunites him with the franchise he led for over a decade, bolstering a roster that is currently in a rebuilding phase.</p>
