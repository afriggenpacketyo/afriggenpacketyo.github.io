          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's next chancellor after a second vote in parliament, overcoming an initial defeat. The first vote saw Merz fall short of the required majority, an unprecedented event in post-war German history. Despite his coalition with the Social Democrats having enough seats, some members dissented. After negotiations, a second vote was held, where Merz secured the chancellorship. He will be sworn in by the president, and his cabinet will take office, averting a potential crisis for the coalition.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement aimed at easing exports for UK firms and reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear. The deal, finalized after three years of discussions, does not include changes to immigration policies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a landmark deal to boost growth, while India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as mutually beneficial. The agreement is projected to increase trade by ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040, benefiting consumers and businesses in both countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge that saw it reach multi-decade highs, fueled by speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the recent weakening, the Taiwanese dollar remains up against the U.S. dollar for the year. Experts suggest that the currency's upward swings were driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt. The Taiwanese central bank's actions are being closely monitored, with speculation that exchange rates may be part of U.S.-Taiwan trade conversations.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the shingles vaccine can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The study, involving over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in vaccinated individuals. The protective effect was more pronounced in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Experts suggest the vaccine's benefits may stem from preventing blood vessel damage and inflammation associated with shingles.</p>

          <p>Palantir's shares fell after the company reported earnings that met expectations and raised its full-year revenue guidance. The artificial intelligence software company saw growth in both its commercial and government sectors. CEO Alex Karp attributed the company's growth to increased adoption of its tools, particularly in the U.S. defense sector. Analysts, however, raised concerns about international growth and the company's high software multiple, contributing to the stock's decline.</p>

          <p>A generations-long culture of deep-diving among women on a South Korean Island may have changed their genetic evolution. Haenyeo, literally "sea women", are Korean cultural divers who have developed adaptations allowing them to dive for longer periods than other people. The island's inhabitants appear to have unique genes that protect against blood pressure changes that can affect pregnancy. This could lead to medical discoveries in the future.</p>
