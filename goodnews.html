          <p>The FDA has approved Teal Health's at-home alternative to the Pap smear, the first of its kind in the U.S. The Teal Wand uses a swab to collect vaginal samples that women mail to a lab for HPV testing. A U.S.-based study found at-home screening as effective as in-office procedures, with women preferring the convenience. This aims to increase screening rates and reduce cervical cancer deaths, particularly among Black and Native American women, with the device available by prescription through telehealth services starting next month in California before expanding nationwide.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a booster malfunction, re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The event is a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which successfully landed probes on Venus. Experts note the re-entry, while historically significant, is not uncommon, as space debris frequently falls back to Earth, and they also note that it is a reminder of the amount of material from the space race still orbiting the Earth.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions. Diller argues that relying solely on data can be harmful and that instinct and common sense are essential for success. He shares examples from his career at ABC, including the made-for-TV movies "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," where instinct played a crucial role in their success, and he explains how too much information can overload and obscure the essence of a good idea.</p>
