          <p>Cole Hauser, the actor from "Yellowstone," spoke about his commitment to supporting veterans every day, not just on Memorial Day. He expressed his interest in giving back to the community and inspiring people to follow their dreams. Hauser, who serves on the board of special operations for the Warrior Foundation and contributes through his coffee company, Free Reign, aims to assist veterans in achieving their goals. He highlighted that many veterans continue to struggle mentally and physically even when there is no active war.

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe rice prices will decrease under the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following his predecessor's dismissal due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The survey also revealed that 44.7% of respondents want rice prices to fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, which is lower than the target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Additionally, 42.2% believe the removal of former farm minister Taku Eto should have occurred sooner. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has risen to 31.7%, marking a 4.3 percentage point increase from the previous week's survey.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to enhancing the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment they face. During a discussion with young SDF members in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to appropriately supporting their duties, irrespective of the risks involved. This pledge follows the recent enactment of a revised law that includes increased allowances for SDF members, aimed at addressing a serious recruitment shortage. The government's efforts to bolster defense capabilities come amid concerns over China's maritime assertiveness, North Korea's missile launches, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The first nationalized service departed on time from Woking to Surbiton, although the journey to London Waterloo involved a rail replacement bus due to engineering work. While the government hailed this as a "new dawn for rail," they refrained from promising lower fares, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized that the taxpayer already subsidizes the trains by ¬£2 billion annually, stating her commitment to ensuring customers receive good value for money as the service integrates into Great British Railways.</p>

          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, a virologist from the University of Nottingham has urged the public not to be overly concerned, while acknowledging that mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus were found in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, prompting increased mosquito surveillance in the area. Professor Jonathan Ball explained that the virus primarily affects birds and mosquitoes, with occasional transmission to humans causing mild symptoms in most cases. He emphasized that the best way to avoid infection is to prevent mosquito bites through protective clothing and insecticide use.</p>
