          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, reaching 101.7 miles per hour, and allowed only one hit and one walk. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss. The game also featured a career-high 22nd home run for Cubs player Seiya Suzuki in a separate matchup.</p>

Despite the ongoing negotiations, significant differences appear to remain, with the Trump administration showing no signs of reducing the sector-based tariffs.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains why cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water benefit from natural cooling through evaporation. This effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and more intense heatwaves.</p>

Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the event under a different legal provision. The march became a broad celebration of human rights and solidarity, sending a clear message of opposition to Orban's policies.</p>

This price hike is intended to raise revenue for the zoo, which faces significant budget restraints.
