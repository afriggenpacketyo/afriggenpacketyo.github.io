Saturn will be at its closest and brightest on September 21, appearing as a non-twinkling star in Pisces, with its rings visible through a telescope. The Orionid meteor shower, active from October 2 to November 7, will peak around October 22, offering fast-moving meteors originating from Halley's Comet. Optimal viewing conditions are expected during the peak due to the new moon, providing minimal light pollution for these cosmic displays.</p>

          <p>Keith Rabois, the new chairman of Opendoor Technologies, asserted that the company's workforce of 1,400 employees is 'bloated' and could be reduced to 200, while also criticizing its 'broken' culture. Rabois attributed cultural issues to remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, pledging a return to 'merit and excellence.' These comments come as Opendoor, a company that buys and sells homes, has recently become a meme stock, with its share price surging 470% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three octogenarian Austrian nuns, Sisters Bernadette (88), Regina (86), and Rita (82), have defiantly returned to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent after being moved to a care home against their will. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to the abandoned building, which had been their home for decades and also housed a girls' school. Despite church authorities deeming the convent rooms unsuitable for their care, the nuns expressed immense happiness to be back, determined to stay, and receiving support from a steady stream of visitors.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk's strategic outreach to younger voters, particularly young men, is being credited as a significant factor in Donald Trump's 2024 presidential election victory. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, successfully mobilized low-propensity Trump supporters in battleground states and persuaded an older generation of GOP leaders to invest in youth engagement. Exit polls indicate Trump improved his performance with voters under 30, winning 43% nationally, a substantial gain from previous Republican candidates. This article highlights how Kirk's efforts helped Trump build a more diverse coalition and secure key swing states.</p>

          <p>The sequel 'Spinal Tap II: The End Continues' attempts to rekindle the magic of the iconic 1984 rock mockumentary but ultimately falls short, according to a recent review. While the sight of Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls reuniting for a final concert offers some nostalgic smiles, the film's comedy is reportedly sapped by the band's revered status and numerous celebrity cameos. The article suggests that the concept of Spinal Tap being admired by music legends diminishes the original's outsider tension and satirical edge. This review indicates that some classics are best left in their original form.</p>
