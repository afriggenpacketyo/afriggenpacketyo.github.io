          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison along with 13 other political prisoners after five years of incarceration. Tikhanovsky has been moved to Lithuania and reunited with his wife, who is living in exile in Vilnius, marking their first reunion since 2020. The release occurred during a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg, who met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. While the release is seen as a significant diplomatic breakthrough for Lukashenko, hundreds of other political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, as the country continues to face Western sanctions and political repression.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserted that the Trump administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil, who was detained for over three months, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and for the rights of immigrants still in detention. He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize those who disagree with the administration. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who joined Khalil at the airport, stated that his release indicates the Trump administration is losing the legal battle to deport migrants who advocate for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced that Neuralink, his neurotechnology company, will begin human trials for vision implants within the next year. The implants aim to restore vision to individuals who are completely blind by writing directly to the visual cortex. Neuralink has already tested the implant on a monkey, with Musk stating that the initial vision offered will be low resolution but will improve over time, eventually exceeding the capabilities of human eyes. The technology could also enable users to see ultraviolet rays, infrared, and radar, offering what Musk described as a "superpower situation."</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities seized 110,000 fentanyl pills and arrested three people, including an American citizen and a dual national, in a binational operation involving the FBI. The arrests occurred in Ciudad Ju√°rez after security agents identified the suspects traveling in a vehicle and found the pills divided into 10 packages. The suspects were handed over to the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the pills were placed into police custody. The arrests aim to curb the trafficking of illicit substances and prevent drugs from reaching young people, aligning with President Claudia Sheinbaum's priority of combating illegal drug distribution.</p>
