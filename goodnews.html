          <p>An Austrian court acquitted former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of perjury charges, overturning an eight-month suspended sentence.  The charges related to Kurz's statements to a parliamentary inquiry in 2020 concerning his role in appointing executives for the OBAG state holding company.  Prosecutors argued that Kurz downplayed his involvement, while Kurz maintained he was only "informed."  The acquittal concludes a significant legal case against the former chancellor.</p>
