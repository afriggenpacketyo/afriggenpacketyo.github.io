          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region experienced gains, mirroring a positive performance on Wall Street driven by a rally in technology stocks. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all saw increases in early trading. This upward trend followed a strong session for the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 in the U.S., which was boosted by optimism regarding tech companies' ability to navigate regulatory challenges. Despite the equity gains, concerns about the broader global economy continue to influence investor sentiment, with global bond markets remaining a key area of focus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered an 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork originally belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose collection was seized after he fled Amsterdam in 1940. The painting was discovered after being spotted in an online real estate listing for a home connected to the descendants of a high-ranking Nazi lawyer. The recovered piece is reported to be in good condition, marking a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to repatriate art stolen during the war.</p>

          <p>The "Made in China 2025" industrial plan, launched a decade ago, has been an important instrument in Beijing's strategy to transform the nation into a global technology leader. The policy has systematically addressed structural weaknesses by coordinating central government guidance with flexible local implementation and substantial state funding. Initially focused on becoming less reliant on foreign technology, the plan has fostered significant growth in key sectors like information technology. This institutionalized approach has helped China transition from a follower in low-tech manufacturing to an innovator in high-tech industries, reshaping its economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares for fashion retailer American Eagle experienced a significant 25% jump in after-hours trading after the company reported better-than-expected performance. Executives attributed the success to recent viral marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce, which boosted customer engagement and sales. Despite an initial sales slip earlier in the year, the company now forecasts low single-digit growth in the coming months. The controversial "Great Jeans" ad with Sweeney, in particular, generated massive online attention and led to her signature jeans selling out within a week, showcasing the power of its celebrity-driven strategy.</p>

The win was particularly meaningful for Anisimova, as it came just 53 days after she suffered a decisive 6-0, 6-0 loss to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final. Anisimova revealed that she rewatched the painful Wimbledon match to analyze her performance and motivate herself for the rematch at Flushing Meadows. Her victory demonstrates a remarkable turnaround and mental fortitude, setting her up for a semifinal match against four-time major champion Naomi Osaka.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants for Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal. The judge described the move as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" and stated that the administration used concerns about antisemitism as a pretext to retaliate against the university for not complying with its demands. These demands included ending diversity programs and screening international students for ideological biases. The ruling vacates the freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, and bars the administration from enforcing the orders, though the White House has announced its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and its allies are prepared to provide long-term security support for Ukraine, both during the ongoing conflict and after a potential peace agreement is reached. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated that allies would help secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once peace is established. This commitment comes as allies in the "Coalition of the Willing" are reportedly ready to offer security guarantees, potentially including the deployment of European troops to deter future Russian aggression. The statements underscore a unified front among Ukraine's partners to ensure its sovereignty, even as Russia's leader conveys a defiant stance on continuing the war.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies are making notable strides in the development of AI "agentic frameworks," the foundational tools used to create autonomous AI agents. Tech giant Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, following similar moves by ByteDance and Alibaba. These platforms enable the creation of AI agents capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks for users without direct human intervention. This progress signifies China's growing competitiveness in a sophisticated area of AI, challenging U.S. counterparts like OpenAI and positioning Chinese firms as key players in the next wave of artificial intelligence innovation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, stating that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion" as required by the law. The administration had used the obscure wartime statute to rapidly remove hundreds of migrants, including some accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. The Fifth Circuit's decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy, which has faced numerous challenges over due process and its definition of "invasion." The court found that mass illegal migration does not equate to an armed, organized force, blocking the act's use in this context.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, a city in eastern China, has introduced a new stimulus measure to boost consumer spending in its local economy. The policy offers cash subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan ($700) to individuals who host banquets of five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan. This initiative is part of a broader effort to stimulate consumption in sectors like catering, retail, and housing amid strained economic growth. The move highlights the challenge for local officials, who are tasked with encouraging spending while also adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached in North Carolina to prevent approximately 98,000 registered voters from being purged from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had demanded the state board of elections remove voters who had not provided a driver's license or partial Social Security number upon registration. The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the purge violated the National Voter Registration Act. Under the negotiated agreement, these voters will now be allowed to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, ensuring their ability to vote.</p>
