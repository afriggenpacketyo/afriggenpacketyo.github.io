          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with global pharmaceutical companies, driven by cost-saving measures. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar licensing deals for its drug candidates, causing its shares to surge. This trend reflects an alternative strategy for Chinese biotech firms to raise funds amid depressed valuations, with the number and value of deals exceeding previous years.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The agreement follows technical talks between the two nations and involves issuing a public notice to ease the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities. While Japan welcomes the move, it continues to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures imposed after the 2011 nuclear disaster. The resumption of seafood trade is seen as a significant milestone in resolving bilateral tensions.</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, signaling an end to a major crypto enforcement action. The original complaint alleged violations including illegally serving U.S. users and commingling customer funds. This dismissal coincides with a shift in the political landscape, as the Trump administration is making concerted efforts to prove that it's an ally to the industry. Binance is also forging ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aspiring to be a crypto bank and funnels 75% of profits to entities linked to the Trump family. </p>
