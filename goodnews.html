        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached an agreement with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cost of popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for employers and their workers. This deal aims to provide access to these medications at a reduced price for plan sponsors, capping monthly out-of-pocket costs for members at $200. The new arrangement also includes a streamlined pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and Evernorth's home delivery service, with potential cost reductions of up to 20% for existing clients already covering weight loss drugs. This move comes after CVS Caremark's announcement to prioritize Novo's Wegovy, potentially impacting coverage for Lilly's Zepbound. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota concluded with the failure of a proposal to ban the "tush push," a play successfully executed by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal did not reach the required 75% majority, with the vote being 22-10. The Eagles and several other teams voted against the ban, with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie delivering a "passionate but fair" speech in defense of the play. The "tush push," also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward for short yardage, and the Eagles have been notably successful with it, converting 39 of 48 attempts in the 2024 season.</p>
