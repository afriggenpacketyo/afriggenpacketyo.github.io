          <p>Chicago artist Liz Flores has designed a special edition Chicago Cubs jersey to celebrate Hispanic and Latino Heritage Night at Wrigley Field, successfully merging cultural and civic pride. The design thoughtfully incorporates traditional folk motifs from various Latino cultures while maintaining the team's iconic color scheme and featuring the Spanish name "Cachorros." Flores expressed her hope that the jersey serves as a bridge between identities and inspires other Latina artists to share their unique stories. The limited-edition item was so popular that it sold out almost immediately.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants are reportedly planning to start rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart in their upcoming Week 4 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, replacing veteran Russell Wilson. This decision follows a challenging performance against the Kansas City Chiefs, during which Wilson threw two interceptions and the offense struggled, prompting boos from the home crowd. Head coach Brian Daboll had previously indicated that the team was evaluating all positions, signaling a potential shift to the promising first-round draft pick to energize the team's performance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has clarified that the central bank's recent decision to lower its key interest rate was primarily motivated by growing concerns about a weakening labor market. He stated that these employment worries now outweigh the risks of persistent inflation, creating a complex economic picture. Powell described the current environment as a "challenging situation" with downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation, requiring a careful balancing act to manage the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and low unemployment.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening earlier in the year, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the United States showed signs of slowing in July. According to new data, the year-over-year price increase fell to 2.3%, dropping below the pre-pandemic average and suggesting that landlords may be losing some pricing power as consumer finances become more constrained. While most major metropolitan areas experienced this deceleration in rent growth, Chicago stood out as a notable exception, where tight inventory and resilient demand continued to drive strong price increases.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The administration had previously suspended the funds, which are designated for critical medical research, over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The judge ruled that the government likely violated federal law by failing to provide a specific and lawful explanation for the funding cuts, marking a significant legal victory for the university.</p>

          <p>Leading health agencies from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have issued strong statements rejecting the Trump administration's recent claims linking acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. These international bodies have reaffirmed that, based on rigorous scientific evidence, the medication remains a safe and important option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. Their unified stance joins that of U.S. medical groups in countering what they characterize as dangerous misinformation that could cause unnecessary public alarm.</p>

          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its most affordable point in three years. For a prospective borrower taking out a $350,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128. This represents a saving of about $210 per month compared to the 7%-plus rates that were common at the start of the year, offering significant financial relief for new homebuyers and creating attractive refinancing options.
