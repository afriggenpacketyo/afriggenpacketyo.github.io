          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and compensates former players who were previously barred from revenue sharing. This agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program adjustments at various schools. The settlement also establishes a third-party clearinghouse to review name, image, and likeness (NIL) agreements, which could face legal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era of big money in college sports. NCAA Division I schools can now directly pay athletes, capped at $20.5 million per school, and $2.75 billion will be paid to former athletes who were not allowed to earn money. This settlement aims to address the imbalance between the revenue generated by college sports and the compensation received by athletes. A third-party clearinghouse will review name, image, and likeness (NIL) agreements, though its legality is questioned.</p>

          <p>The phone call between the leaders of China and the US could offer a respite for many Asian countries caught in their rivalry, but the detente might also complicate their calculations on how to strike a balance between the two superpowers, according to analysts. For many of China‚Äôs neighbors that have relied on trade with both powers, the call between the two leaders has eased their predicament of having to choose between prioritizing trade with China and navigating aggressive US policies. The call marked a ‚Äútentative step back from the brink, offering brief respite for Asian neighbours like South Korea‚Äù.</p>

Ishiba aims to overhaul the production adjustment system to counter opposition parties proposing consumption tax cuts. The goal is to boost rice production while preventing a price plunge from oversupply. Japan introduced the acreage reduction policy in the early 1970s to address rice overproduction. Ishiba's consumer-focused approach involves releasing reserve rice to lower prices.</p>
