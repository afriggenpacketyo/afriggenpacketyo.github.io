          <p>Renowned investor Mark Cuban shared insights from his first business venture, a powdered milk sales operation launched at age 24 with under $20, which failed within a month. Despite the failure, the article highlights that Cuban learned a crucial lesson: "It doesn't matter how many times you fail. You only have to be right one time." He advises aspiring entrepreneurs with limited funds to focus on service-based businesses, leveraging "sweat equity" and identifying market needs. Cuban also noted that if he were starting today, he would focus on artificial intelligence.</p>
