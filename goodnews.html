          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is making a concerted effort to become a world-leading biopharmaceutical hub, aiming to rival Boston's success in the sector. With 3,800 biotech companies already established, the city plans to attract more top-tier firms by offering substantial subsidies and aims to host over 10,000 companies by 2030. This ambition is supported by local academic institutions, such as Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, which has co-founded an Academy of Pharmacy to train future leaders in drug innovation. The initiative represents a significant strategic investment by China to dominate a key high-tech industry.</p>

Despite being the crowd favorites at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Raducanu and Alcaraz were outplayed by the more experienced doubles pairing. The match was part of a reimagined mixed doubles event designed to attract top singles players with a significant prize fund and a primetime schedule. While the atmosphere was festive, the result highlighted the superior doubles strategy of Pegula and Draper, who advanced to the semi-finals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, tiny moon orbiting the planet Uranus, provisionally named S/2025 U1. The satellite, which is only about six miles in diameter, was identified by the James Webb Space Telescope and is the 29th known moon of the ice giant. Its small size is likely why it was missed by previous observations, including the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986. Researchers suggest the discovery could hint at the existence of more small moons, offering new insights into the planet's potentially chaotic evolutionary history. The moon will be officially named later by the International Astronomical Union.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Commemoration of Wartime History Can Coexist with Appreciation for Modern Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 17:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II is not about inciting hatred but about remembering historical truths. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the Japanese military aggression is distinct from attitudes toward modern Japanese culture and people. Drawing from personal experience growing up with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime, the writer suggests that one can condemn past actions and attempts to distort history while simultaneously embracing contemporary Japan. The piece frames the remembrance as a necessary reflection on sacrifice and resilience, not as a tool for vengeance.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Tax Appeals Tribunal has ordered Allied Beverages Limited, a marketing agency for Coca-Cola, to pay 9.7 billion UGX (approximately $2.7 million) in value-added tax. The agency had classified its services as exports to the U.S.-based Coca-Cola Export Corporation to avoid the 18% VAT rate. However, the tribunal ruled that since the promotional activities, such as advertisements, were consumed within Uganda and benefited the local bottler, the tax is applicable. The decision underscores the efforts of national revenue authorities to ensure multinational corporations and their partners comply with local tax laws.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison for illegally exporting firearms and military equipment to North Korea. The Justice Department stated that Wen, who remained in the U.S. illegally after his student visa expired, was directed by North Korean officials to procure the goods. He purchased weapons in Texas and shipped them from California, disguising at least one shipment as a refrigerator, in exchange for $2 million. The case highlights a complex international smuggling operation that took advantage of U.S. gun laws to violate sanctions against North Korea.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged Ethan Foltz, a 22-year-old from Oregon, with developing and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." The network allegedly consisted of 65,000 to 95,000 malware-infected devices, such as routers and DVRs, which were used to launch large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Prosecutors claim Foltz loaned the botnet to customers who targeted victims in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network and major tech companies. Law enforcement disabled the botnet after a search of Foltz's home, and he now faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the retailer maintained its full-year financial outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for earnings and revenue. The company still anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year, signaling confidence in its business despite a challenging economic environment for home improvement. Executives noted that while many homeowners are still deferring large projects due to economic uncertainty, they saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000. The company's performance reflects a gradual but building momentum in its core business categories. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global electric vehicle leader BYD has officially registered its local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, fueling speculation that it plans to establish a production facility in the country. The legal filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina not just to import and sell vehicles, but also to manufacture them, along with batteries and other parts. While the company has not confirmed specific plans, this move aligns with its broader regional expansion strategy in Latin America, which includes a major factory already under development in Brazil. If it proceeds, the plant would be BYD's second in Latin America, significantly boosting its presence in the region's auto market.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent summits with Russian and Ukrainian leaders have meaningfully increased the possibility of ending the war in Ukraine. The author suggests that despite ongoing Russian aggression, Trump's willingness to discuss security guarantees and facilitate a potential trilateral meeting represents a positive step. The article acknowledges formidable obstacles, such as Putin's territorial demands and the risk of dividing Ukrainian society. However, it concludes that Trump can keep the process on track by using his skills in strategic ambiguity and leveraging U.S. military and economic power to pressure Russia toward a genuine compromise.</p>

          <p>Major food and beverage chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new drink offerings to attract customers, particularly younger Gen Z consumers. Data shows that beverage-specific purchases are on the rise, with customers increasingly visiting chains for a "pick-me-up" rather than as a meal add-on. Companies are responding with customized, cold, and colorful drinks, from Dunkin's Refreshers to McDonald's upcoming "dirty sodas" and Starbucks' new protein cold foam. This strategic shift reflects the higher profitability of beverages compared to food and represents a key effort to reverse sales slumps in a challenging consumer environment.
