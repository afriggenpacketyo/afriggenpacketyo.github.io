This strategic move is positioned as a merger of equals aimed at creating a global champion in critical minerals with strong Canadian leadership.

          <p>Paris-based artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of nearly $14 billion following a new Series C funding round. Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML was the lead investor, injecting 1.3 billion euros to secure an 11% stake in the company. This major investment, which also included contributions from existing backers like Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz, more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation. The funding highlights the continued investor enthusiasm for the AI sector and solidifies Mistral's position as a significant European competitor to American firms like OpenAI.

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch family has been resolved, with an agreement ensuring that Rupert Murdoch's son, Lachlan, will take control of the media empire. The deal establishes a new trust controlled by Lachlan, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will sell their shares in Fox and News Corp and cease to be beneficiaries of any trust with company shares. This resolution ends all litigation over the family's trust and solidifies the ongoing conservative direction of prominent outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal after Rupert Murdoch's eventual passing.</p>

          <p>Scotland achieved a crucial, if unexciting, victory against Belarus in a behind-closed-doors World Cup qualifying match, securing three vital points. The performance was described as professional rather than spectacular, with Che Adams playing a key role by scoring one goal and contributing to another. The result, combined with Denmark's decisive win over Greece, has shaken up the group dynamics. This puts Scotland in a strong position as they prepare for a monumentally important home fixture against Greece, which could prove pivotal for their qualification hopes.</p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been released for the first time, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and finances, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables will help identify where support is needed, but organizations like NHS Providers have questioned the methodology. The lowest-ranked trust is Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, which has faced significant structural issues with its buildings.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to announce its next iPhone lineup, expected to be called the iPhone 17, with added intrigue surrounding potential price increases due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could lead Apple to raise prices by $50 to $100 on some models for the first time in five years to protect its profit margins. The launch comes amid pressure on Apple to move manufacturing to the U.S. and follows a year where the company's AI feature rollout did not fully meet expectations, lowering anticipation for this year's more incremental updates.</p>
