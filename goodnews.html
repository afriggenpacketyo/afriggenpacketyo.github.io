          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that roses were likely yellow before evolving to the red color that they are commonly associated with today. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to determine that their common ancestor was likely a yellow flower with a single row of petals.
