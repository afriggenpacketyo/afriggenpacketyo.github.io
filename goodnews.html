          <p>People with terminal illnesses are increasingly creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final stages of life. This practice is gaining recognition in palliative care for its therapeutic benefits, as music can evoke powerful memories and reduce anxiety, even in unconscious patients. Experts note that hearing is one of the last senses to fade, allowing music to keep patients connected to their loved ones and surroundings. These playlists also offer lasting comfort to grieving family members after a person has passed away.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Monday, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. China is expected to hold its key lending rates steady, a move that would follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains. The positive sentiment was buoyed by a strong week in U.S. markets, where the Dow and S&P 500 reached new all-time highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers completed a historic early-season sweep of their AFC West rivals with a 23-20 comeback win against the Denver Broncos. Quarterback Justin Herbert connected with Keenan Allen for a late touchdown to tie the game before Cameron Dicker kicked a 43-yard field goal as time expired. The victory gives the Chargers their first 3-0 start since 2002 and marks the first time in franchise history they have defeated all three divisional opponents in their first three games. The win was tempered by an Achilles tendon injury to running back Najee Harris.</p>

          <p>This article posits that if an investor could only choose one stock to hold indefinitely, Amazon would be a compelling choice due to its diversified nature. The company operates across multiple dominant sectors, including e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), advertising, AI, and logistics, effectively functioning like a multi-industry portfolio in a single stock. The immense profitability of AWS provides capital for expansion and innovation in its other divisions, creating a powerful synergistic business model.

          <h2>Expert Outlines Nine Practices of Parents Who Raise Children with Strong Social Skills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 families, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than just teaching polite phrases, these parents focus on creating an environment of emotional safety. They also teach children how to repair relationships after conflict and validate their feelings, which builds a strong foundation for emotionally intelligent communication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has stated that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address rising costs and better support people returning to work. The government plans to press ahead with changes offering skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to seek employment. McFadden argued the current system creates an "unhealthy" binary between being fit or unfit for work, trapping people and increasing the benefits bill. The goal is to provide more tailored support to help those who are able to work re-enter the labor market.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the bacteria. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice with a heritable immunity to Lyme, which would break the infection cycle as ticks feeding on them would not become carriers. The team, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, is working closely with the community on Nantucket, an island with a high incidence of the disease, to ensure public buy-in before any potential release. This pioneering effort represents a new frontier in using genetic technology to solve public health challenges.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies, capable of living up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, undertakes an extraordinary 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. These butterflies suppress their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the journey, navigating via an internal sun compass and the Earth's magnetic field. While their population has declined significantly, conservation efforts like planting milkweed are underway to support them. The annual arrival of millions of these butterflies in Mexico is a celebrated event, culturally significant as it coincides with the Day of the Dead.</p>
