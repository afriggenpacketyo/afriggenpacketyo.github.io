          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 08:45:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how student loan borrowers in default may have up to 15% of their Social Security benefits garnished to repay their debt. Experts emphasize that beneficiaries will be left with at least $750 a month after the offset. Borrowers are reportedly receiving less notice of these offsets, limiting their ability to challenge the action. The article advises borrowers to ensure their contact information is current with their loan servicer and to seek help if they receive a notice of offset, as they may be able to contest it due to financial hardship or a pending loan discharge.</p>

The agreement marks a shift towards "mutual respect" between the two nations, contrasting with previous strained relations. Businesses are now aware of the need to mitigate tariff uncertainty, and the agreement may lead to large Chinese purchases and investments in the U.S. The article notes China's continued emphasis on self-sufficiency and diversification away from U.S. agricultural goods, even as trade relations thaw. </p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, although epidurals are expected to remain outside coverage. This move aims to standardize childbirth costs nationwide, which currently vary significantly by prefecture. While the government provides a lump-sum payment for each childbirth, costs often exceed this amount, raising concerns among obstetricians about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that proposed Medicaid work requirements would negatively impact hardworking Americans and reduce health care coverage. He cites reports from Arkansas and Georgia that show such policies do not incentivize work but rather create red tape that prevents eligible individuals from accessing care. Warnock contends that providing health care coverage without these requirements would encourage people to work by ensuring they are healthy. He criticizes the Republican proposal, which could put millions at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, and contrasts it with his view that health care is a basic right that supports a stronger economy.</p>
