          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her San Francisco concert when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred while she was performing her song "Roar" high above the audience. Perry quickly recovered from the apparent surprise and continued her performance without interruption, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. This event is part of her "The Lifetimes Tour," which features multiple aerial stunts and props, highlighting the inherent risks in such elaborate stage productions.</p>

          <p>Chicago Sky All-Star Angel Reese has opened up about the intense cyberbullying she faced following her 2023 national championship victory with LSU. The experience, which included threats and the exposure of her personal information, prompted her to launch a campaign to raise awareness about the issue. Reese explained that while she has developed a thicker skin, she recognizes that not everyone is as resilient. She aims to use her platform to support others and transform a negative experience into a positive force for community and sisterhood within the league.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of drivers are avoiding steep "kiss-and-fly" charges at UK airports by waiting in unofficial spots just outside the terminals. Research shows that over half of the busiest airports have raised their drop-off fees, with some charging as much as £6 for a brief 10-minute stay. This has led to a cat-and-mouse game where drivers park in lay-bys and on side roads, coordinating with arriving passengers via phone to time their pickup perfectly. Many travelers and taxi drivers criticize the fees as exorbitant and greedy, impacting both convenience and cost.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in the United Kingdom over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week summer school holiday and redistribute the time throughout the year. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help mitigate "holiday hunger" for low-income families. However, teachers express concerns about losing crucial time for rest and planning, while others worry it could concentrate travel demand into a smaller window, driving up vacation prices. The discussion also considers the impact of increasingly hot summers on the school calendar.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor is advocating for a shift in public mindset, urging savers to consider the benefits of investing in stocks and shares rather than holding funds in low-interest cash accounts. The government plans to send details of investment opportunities to those with significant savings and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize a move to stocks and shares ISAs. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that any push must be handled carefully to avoid deterring a new generation of investors, especially in uncertain markets.

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are seriously considering signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, who previously played for the team from 2011 to 2017. Lawrence Frank, the team's president of basketball operations, confirmed the strong interest, stating that Paul possesses qualities the team is looking for to enhance its ball-handling and playmaking. At 40 years old, Paul would likely take on a reserve role, adding depth behind guards like James Harden and Bradley Beal. The potential move is part of the Clippers' strategy to build a versatile roster capable of contending in the competitive Western Conference.</p>

The plan also includes banning wet wipes containing plastic and reducing phosphorus pollution. The announcement precedes a major review of the water industry, which faces scrutiny for rising consumer bills alongside high executive bonuses.</p>

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, following joint appearances with French and British leaders.

While major milestones have been achieved, such as Google's quantum processors solving problems exponentially faster than supercomputers, the technology still faces challenges with "noise" and has yet to solve a practical, real-world problem.
