          <h2>General Mills to Remove Artificial Dyes from All Foods by 2027</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 12:50:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Mills announced its commitment to remove artificial coloring from all of its products by the end of 2027, following a similar announcement by Kraft Heinz. The company stated that 85% of its retail products and nearly all of its school offerings are already made without certified colors. This decision aligns with the recent request from the FDA and HHS for the food industry to reduce the use of synthetic food dyes, although no outright ban has been implemented. General Mills, headquartered in Minnesota, aims to complete the removal of artificial dyes from cereals and school products by the summer of 2026, with the remaining lineup following by the end of 2027.</p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle startup, Zoox, is increasing its robotaxi production at a new facility in Hayward, California, as it prepares for a commercial launch in Las Vegas later this year. The facility currently produces one robotaxi per day, with plans to accelerate production to assemble 10,000 robotaxis annually, roughly three per hour. Zoox, acquired by Amazon in 2020, aims to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S. and already has a few dozen robotaxis undergoing testing on public roads in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The company anticipates operating between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 12:42:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, mandates full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance for stablecoin issuers. The legislation grants significant authority to the Treasury Secretary, and it drew criticism from some senators who accused Republicans of enabling Trump's crypto corruption. The GENIUS Act now moves to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with their version of a stablecoin bill; the Senate version centralizes oversight with Treasury, while the House splits authority between the Federal Reserve and other entities (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its meeting, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision signals ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor the impact of economic policies and inflation. While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, uncertainty persists due to ongoing tariffs. Economists predict a high probability that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate, as the economy continues to show signs of stability (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions Head Coach Andy Farrell reports that the squad is in "good shape" with injuries after a scare involving Jamison Gibson-Park. With players from Leinster, Bath, and Leicester Tigers involved in domestic finals, a smaller panel convened in Portugal for a training camp. Farrell believes the talent at his disposal shows the depth of the touring party, and the team will face Argentina before heading to Perth to meet Western Force ahead of the first Test against Australia.</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are set to reach 30C, with the heat expected to build steadily throughout the week, likely resulting in the first heatwave of 2025. Yellow heat health-alerts are in place for most of England until Sunday evening, indicating a greater risk to vulnerable people. Temperatures will peak in different areas on different days across the UK, with some of the highest figures expected in the south and east, the Midlands, and South West England. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was involved in several physical altercations during a game against the Connecticut Sun, including being pushed to the ground and doing some shoving of her own. The Fever won the game 88-71, but the match featured multiple skirmishes, including a fight in the final minute that led to three ejections. Indiana's coach Stephanie White blamed "bad officiating" for the chippy play, stating that the competitive nature of the players led to the altercations. The Fever earned a spot in the Commissioner‚Äôs Cup championship game with the win, where they will face the Minnesota Lynx.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, a federally recognized U.S. holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War and is also known as Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, or America's second Independence Day. The name Juneteenth is a portmanteau that combines the words June and nineteenth, dating back to June 19, 1865, when the last group of people enslaved in the southern U.S. were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. Celebrations vary, but often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops, and other cultural events centered on art and cuisine.</p>

The steel will continue to be "mined, melted and made" in the United States, and the partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs. The companies have entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, requiring Nippon Steel to make about $11 billion in new investments in U.S. Steel by 2028, while the United Steelworkers union issued a statement accusing the companies of "down-playing concerns" about what the deal would mean over the long-term.</p>
