          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Nuno was sacked after 21 months, despite leading the club to its highest Premier League finish in decades and securing European qualification. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham after a difficult league season but a historic Europa League win, is considered a strong candidate to take over. The decision has surprised many of the club's players, and some fans are skeptical of Postecoglou's high-risk tactical approach.</p>

          <p>The long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch family's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control. The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. Under the terms, Lachlan will control a new trust, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with shares in Fox or News Corp. They are set to sell their holdings and will each receive approximately $1.1 billion, effectively ending their influence over the company's editorial stance.</p>

          <p>The city of Shenzhen has launched a new service allowing international tourists to receive instant tax refunds through overseas e-wallets like AlipayHK. The initiative, a collaboration between the Shenzhen Taxation Bureau, the central bank, and Ant International, aims to streamline the refund process from days to seconds. This move is part of a broader Chinese strategy to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate consumer spending. To further encourage tourism, China recently lowered the minimum purchase amount for tax refunds and increased the cash refund ceiling.</p>

          <p>Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, observes that Black students are increasingly drawn to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the current political climate. She suggests that in an era where some seek to erase Black history, HBCUs offer an affirming environment where students feel included and their heritage is valued. Tatum also addresses the broader challenges facing higher education, including what she describes as unprecedented government overreach and ideological pressure from the Trump administration. While HBCUs are seeing a surge in applications, they face financial challenges in providing aid to all deserving students.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the race to become the new deputy leader of the Labour Party is underway, with several prominent figures entering the contest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, a cabinet minister, has positioned herself as a unifier who can challenge the Reform UK party. Other declared candidates include Dame Emily Thornberry, who promises to be a critical voice for the party's membership, and Bell Ribeiro-Addy from the party's left wing. Candidates have a short window to secure nominations from at least 80 MPs before the decision goes to a vote by party members, with the winner to be announced in October.</p>

          <p>Shares of Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure company Nebius Group skyrocketed in premarket trading after announcing a multi-billion-dollar deal with Microsoft. The multi-year agreement, valued at $19.4 billion, will see Nebius provide cloud computing power, specifically graphics processing units (GPUs), for Microsoft's AI workloads. Nebius, which was spun out from Russian tech giant Yandex in 2023, experienced a more than 50% jump in its stock price. The deal highlights the continued high demand for the powerful computing infrastructure required to train and operate advanced artificial intelligence systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A year after Brian Niccol took over as CEO of Starbucks, his efforts to revitalize the coffee giant have yielded mixed results, with same-store sales and traffic still declining. Niccol has focused on bringing the company "back to Starbucks" by improving the customer experience, making stores more welcoming, and emphasizing coffee quality. While some changes, like the return of handwritten messages on cups, have been met with skepticism from baristas, the company has seen some positive signs, such as a record sales week with the return of its fall menu. However, investors remain cautious, and the company's stock has fallen as the turnaround proves more challenging than initially expected.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been rated and ranked in public league tables, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings assess trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management, then group them into four performance "segments." Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables would increase transparency and accountability, while some trust representatives questioned the fairness of the metrics used. Under the new system, top-performing trusts will gain more autonomy, while those ranked lower will receive enhanced support but could see executive pay reduced.</p>

          <p>Voters in Virginia's 11th Congressional District are heading to the polls for a special election that is expected to reduce the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The election is being held to fill the seat of longtime Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, who passed away in May. Democrat James Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to Connolly, is heavily favored to win in the solidly blue district. A Democratic victory would mean House Speaker Mike Johnson could only afford to lose two Republican votes on any party-line measure, further complicating his ability to manage the narrow majority.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has decided against breaking up Google in a landmark antitrust case, citing the rapid emergence of generative AI as a disruptive force that could challenge the company's search market dominance. While the court found that Google illegally monopolized the market through default-search agreements, Judge Amit Mehta's final ruling focused on lesser remedies, such as information sharing. In his opinion, the judge noted that the "astonishing" investment and innovation in AI by competitors like OpenAI has fundamentally changed the competitive landscape since the case began. This new reality, he argued, lessens the need for a drastic structural remedy like selling off the Chrome browser.</p>
