          <p>Over 500 volunteers, including cancer survivors with diverse political beliefs, recently gathered in Washington, D.C., to advocate for continued federal support for cancer research and patient care. Organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, these citizen lobbyists urged Congress to increase research funding and extend health insurance subsidies amid a contentious budget debate. The event demonstrated that while American politics is deeply divided on many issues, funding for medical research and support for those with serious illnesses continues to have broad, bipartisan public support.</p>

The problem, which Amazon attributed to its domain name system (DNS), affected platforms ranging from social media and gaming to financial services and even Amazon's own products like Alexa. The widespread disruption served as a stark reminder of modern society's heavy reliance on a small number of major cloud computing providers for the internet's core infrastructure, highlighting the significant impact when these critical systems fail.</p>

          <p>Several major investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, have raised their economic growth forecasts for China for the current year, citing stronger-than-expected third-quarter data. Goldman Sachs adjusted its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to 4.9%, stating that the government's official target of 'around 5 percent' is now 'largely on track.' This revision comes despite ongoing domestic and external economic pressures, signaling a degree of optimism from foreign financial institutions about the resilience of China's economy and its ability to meet its growth objectives.

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed former Burnley and Everton manager Sean Dyche as their new boss, making him the club's third manager this season. Dyche succeeds Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed after a brief 39-day tenure in which he failed to secure a single win. With the team currently in the relegation zone, the appointment of the experienced and pragmatic Dyche is seen as a strategic move aimed at ensuring Premier League survival, intended to bring stability to a squad that has struggled for consistency this season.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities, with the stated ambition of becoming the world's leading AI power by 2030 through massive state and private investment. Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba have recently launched powerful large language models that rival top Western competitors at a lower cost, leveraging the country's vast online population as a testing ground. While the U.S. still leads in frontier research, China is gaining ground by making many of its models open-source and exporting AI infrastructure, challenging American technological supremacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since joining Arsenal, Declan Rice has evolved from a traditional holding midfielder into a more dynamic box-to-box player, significantly increasing his attacking contributions. The summer signing of deep-lying midfielder Martin Zubimendi has further enabled this transition, allowing Rice to leverage his running power to join attacks while still starting from a deeper position. This tactical shift has made him a leader for Arsenal in key offensive metrics like ball carries and chances created, with both his club and national team managers adapting their systems to maximize his all-around capabilities.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Australia has identified two protein enzymes that are crucial for the growth and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. The discovery centers on the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease, and offers a potential new therapeutic strategy to regulate it. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, these findings could pave the way for developing new treatments for prostate cancer, a disease that affects an estimated 1.5 million men worldwide each year.</p>

Researchers estimate that hundreds more specimens from the voyage have yet to be formally described, highlighting how much of the ocean's biodiversity remains unknown to science.</p>
