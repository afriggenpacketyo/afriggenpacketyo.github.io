          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown could conclude within the week. He indicated that if a resolution isn't reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The current impasse stems from a partisan disagreement over federal funding, with Democrats insisting on including enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap bill. Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats might soon break the stalemate, allowing the government to reopen and paving the way for further policy negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding outlines five key strategies for effectively working with a "control freak" boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with specific phrasing, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preempting criticism by seeking initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." method to incorporate feedback while still asserting one's own ideas. The article emphasizes conserving personal energy by adapting communication styles to the manager's tendencies.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs rose significantly after the company announced it is exploring the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys have indicated the presence of these critical minerals at two of the company's sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with the national strategy to establish domestic supply chains for essential materials and reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global market. The potential venture could position Cleveland-Cliffs as a key player in securing American manufacturing independence for these vital resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, a trend attributed to several key factors. Historically, heavy government and manufacturer incentives on new EVs have lowered their resale value, as used car buyers are less willing to pay a premium. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, makes older models less desirable relatively quickly. However, this trend may be shifting as a wider variety of more affordable, mainstream EV models enter the used market, potentially stabilizing depreciation rates in the future.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to the Approval Process for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</h2>

          <p>This article explains the complexities and requirements for getting approved for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can liquidate most unsecured debts. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's income to their state's median. Those with income below the median typically qualify easily, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The process also requires recent credit counseling and is scrutinized for any signs of abuse, such as luxury spending just before filing. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement are discussed.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman has won a landslide victory in the Turkish Cypriot leadership election, defeating the incumbent Ersin Tatar with a commanding 62.8% of the vote. Erhurman, a moderate supported by left-wing parties, campaigned on a platform of returning to negotiations for a federal solution to the divided island, a direct challenge to the two-state policy favored by his predecessor and Turkey. His victory is seen as a strong message from the Turkish Cypriot community in favor of preserving its secular identity and redefining its relationship with Ankara. The result has been welcomed by Greek Cypriot leaders as an opportunity to restart long-stalled peace talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, Invesco's senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds that utilize options-based strategies. He argues that these funds offer more reliable downside protection because their performance is not directly correlated with traditional asset classes like stocks. Furthermore, they can provide an income stream that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle. Burrello advises investors to look for ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be wary of unsustainable yields and high fees in this growing space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its annual "Carrie Bradshaw index," which ranks U.S. cities based on the affordability of living alone on a median salary. The index uses the 30% rule, where rent for a studio apartment should not exceed 30% of gross income. This year, Wichita, Kansas, was named the most affordable city, where median wages are 75% higher than what is needed to rent a studio. The report noted a trend of previously affordable cities, particularly in Texas, becoming unaffordable due to rising rents, likely driven by an influx of middle-class workers.</p>

This push for mineral independence is driven by the critical role these materials play in technology, from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry.

However, amid geopolitical competition and U.S. restrictions on technology, Beijing is expected to continue prioritizing state investment in strategic sectors like semiconductors.

          <p>This opinion article argues that state Medicaid programs should be required to cover GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for treating obesity, which affects an estimated 14 million adult Medicaid recipients. While acknowledging the high cost of these drugs, the author contends that the budgetary concerns are overstated, as prices are falling and the medications can lead to significant long-term healthcare savings by reducing obesity-related diseases. The piece highlights that denying coverage to low-income populations creates further health inequalities. It concludes that making these near-miracle drugs accessible through Medicaid is a necessary step to combat a massive public health crisis and save lives.</p>
