          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a second consecutive month of growth in April, accelerating from 2.6% in March to 3%, despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. High-tech manufacturing, particularly biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing, saw significant profit increases, along with household appliance manufacturers benefiting from consumer subsidies. However, certain sectors, such as automobiles and apparel, faced headwinds due to price competition and tariff-related demand shifts, with state-owned industrial firms experiencing a profit decline while private and foreign-invested enterprises improved. Weining Yu from the NBS cautioned about persistent constraints like insufficient demand and external uncertainty, despite the industrial sector's resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from Harlem and Korean War veteran, has died at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy of public service and advocacy for social justice.

Despite facing ethics violations and censure in 2010, Rangel continued to serve his constituents and remained a prominent figure in Harlem politics.
