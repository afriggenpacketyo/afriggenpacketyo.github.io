        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies by ruling that the White House's emergency law invocation lacked the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce, superseding the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling, which stemmed from cases brought by small businesses and state governments. Global markets reacted positively, with stock markets rising and the US dollar gaining against safe-haven currencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has revealed its plans to reform the pension industry, which includes the creation of ¬£25 billion "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth. The reforms aim to replicate the success of large pension investment funds in Australia and Canada, potentially boosting people's pension pots. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the general direction of these reforms, the government is also considering legislative measures as a backup plan, though this element may face industry opposition. These changes are expected to have significant implications for pension scheme operations and could lead to improved retirement outcomes through better governance and wider investment diversification.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of the expected impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to consumers, analysts believe the company may face pressure to do so in the long term. The automaker anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has abandoned its proposed "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community, including the mayor and lawmakers. The plan aimed to shift grading focus to final exams, eliminate the impact of homework and attendance on grades, and alter the letter-grade system. Critics argued the changes would lower standards and fail to adequately prepare students for success. SFUSD Superintendent Maria Su stated that no changes have been made to grading practices and that the district remains committed to high standards and prioritizing learning.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has denounced Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies as "fantasy" economics, likening Farage to former PM Liz Truss and warning that Reform's proposals could lead to increased mortgage costs. Starmer argues that Farage's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown, similar to the turmoil caused by Truss's mini-budget in 2022. Reform UK has proposed more generous tax breaks for married couples, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, and restoring winter fuel payments for all pensioners. Economists have questioned the feasibility of these policies, particularly the plan to raise the income tax threshold, without clear funding sources.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country, ruling that he overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The court's decision overturns decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupting global commerce and raising the risk of higher prices and recession. The ruling does not affect tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, and autos, which were imposed under a different law. Experts suggest the decision will create uncertainty and may prompt countries to delay trade concessions to the U.S.</p>
