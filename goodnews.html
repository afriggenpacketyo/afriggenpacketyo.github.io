          <p>British supermodel David Gandy reflects on his nearly 25-year career, noting his inspiration from female supermodels and his desire to achieve greater pay equity in a female-dominated industry. He expresses significant concern over the rise of artificial intelligence, which he sees as an existential threat to models, photographers, and other artists in fashion. Along with over 2,000 other models, Gandy is calling on the UK government to regulate AI to protect human creators and prevent the industry's potential decline.</p>

          <p>Major US tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, have announced tens of billions of pounds in new investments in the United Kingdom, fueling optimism that the country could become a global AI superpower. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at British pessimism, highlighting the nation's strong foundation in tech research. However, critics like Sir Nick Clegg caution that the UK may just be picking up "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," raising questions about whether this influx of capital will truly transform the economy or simply increase its dependence on American tech giants.</p>

He emphasized that playing the violent gangster for over a decade has been a defining part of his career, though he is nothing like the character in real life.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a major climate and energy package in California, designed to advance clean energy while also stabilizing fuel costs. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-invest program to provide utility bill relief and funds for public transit. However, it has drawn criticism from some environmentalists for a controversial provision that allows for up to 2,000 new oil wells per year in Kern County, a trade-off aimed at ensuring an affordable gasoline supply.</p>
