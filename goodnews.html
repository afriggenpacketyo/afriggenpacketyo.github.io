        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of schools across the United States are implementing locked magnetic pouches, such as those from the company Yondr, to enforce classroom cellphone bans. This measure aims to reduce student distractions and improve engagement, with educators reporting a more positive and interactive school environment. While some students and parents welcome the change, others have raised concerns about the cost, which can be up to $30 per student, and have devised ways to circumvent the system. The trend reflects a broader national movement, with 35 states now having laws or rules limiting phone use in schools.</p>

          <p>Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old entrepreneur, is the co-founder and CEO of Cal AI, a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to estimate the calorie count of food from a photo. Launched in May 2024, the app now boasts 30 employees and generates approximately $1.4 million in gross profit per month. Yadegari, who began coding at age seven, developed the app to solve the personal frustration of tedious manual calorie tracking. Despite his recent enrollment in the University of Miami's business school, he anticipates leaving academia to focus on his venture full-time, aiming to challenge industry leaders like MyFitnessPal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Donald Trump's repeated claims that cities like Chicago are the most dangerous in the world, an analysis of crime data reveals a different reality. The four US cities with the highest murder rates in 2024 are all located in Republican-led states: Jackson, Birmingham, St. Louis, and Memphis. In contrast, violent crime rates in many large, Democratic-led cities, including Chicago, have been falling significantly over the past two years. This article highlights the discrepancy between political rhetoric and statistical trends, noting that the president's focus on blue-city crime overlooks higher rates of violence in several red states.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within the financial sector, a move that analysts believe could bolster long-term confidence despite creating short-term uncertainty. The investigation of high-profile figures is seen as an effort to align with international standards for clean governance, which could ultimately attract more overseas investment. While the immediate effects on market sentiment may be mixed, the drive is intended to establish a more transparent and stable financial environment. The campaign signals Beijing's commitment to rooting out corruption from banking to the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Forensic Genealogy Used to Identify Remains of Revolutionary War Soldiers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 09:59:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal clashes. To identify these forgotten soldiers, a team is now employing forensic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research, treating the 240-year-old case as an ultimate cold case.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially launched the fundraising and planning process for his presidential library, which will be located in his home state of Delaware. A 13-person governance board, including former aides and allies like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, has been established to oversee the project. The team faces the significant challenge of raising hundreds of millions of dollars in a politically polarized climate that may deter some traditional corporate donors. The library aims to feature a museum detailing his presidency and serve as a hub for civic engagement and policy discussions.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system on Sunday, September 7, at approximately 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks by sending a loud, siren-like alert to 4G and 5G mobile phones. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced technical issues, with some users not receiving the alert and others receiving multiples. While the government recommends keeping the alerts enabled for safety, users can opt out through their phone's settings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified the earliest known evidence of interbreeding between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals by re-examining the remains of a five-year-old child discovered in Israel's Skhul Cave in 1935. Using advanced 3D micro-CT scanning, researchers found the child's skull shape was consistent with Homo sapiens but had Neanderthal-like traits in the lower jaw and blood supply. This hybrid individual dates back to a period when Homo sapiens migrating from Africa around 200,000 years ago encountered Neanderthal populations already in the region. The finding pushes back the timeline for such interbreeding by hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare live-streamed exploration of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States at over 1,500 feet. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named "Emmy" descended into the cobalt waters, providing a unique view of the lake bed's ecosystem and geology. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the 2-million-year-old lake's unique environment and the challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. While dispelling myths about mob bodies, the dive highlighted the importance of conservation efforts to protect the lake's famed clarity.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investment firm, has taken a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo and is pushing for a significant strategic overhaul to boost the company's underperforming stock. In a detailed presentation, Elliott argues that PepsiCo's North American beverage business has suffered from keeping its bottling operations in-house and a lack of focus on core brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew. The firm's plan calls for refranchising the bottling network, divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and reinvesting capital to revitalize growth. Elliott believes these changes could unlock at least 50% upside for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Harvard-trained expert Sinéad O'Sullivan, highly successful people like Taylor Swift often exhibit seven key traits that contribute to their achievements. These characteristics include imagination, synthesis (connecting old and new ideas), intense focus on core goals, and doggedness in the face of difficulty. The other traits are sustained passion, reverence for their craft, and a deep commitment that involves forgoing other options. O'Sullivan argues that these individuals avoid dabbling in unimportant ventures and instead dedicate their energy to mastering their chosen field, a strategy that others can adopt to sharpen their own focus.</p>

          <p>Bernadette Joy, a self-made millionaire and financial coach, advocates for renting over homeownership, challenging the conventional wisdom that renting is "throwing money away." After owning four homes, she and her husband sold their properties and found that renting offered greater financial flexibility and fewer hidden costs, such as renovations and unexpected repairs. She argues that the time and emotional energy saved from being a homeowner and landlord allowed her to focus on her business, accelerating her wealth creation by investing the proceeds in index funds instead of real estate.

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unpublished jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré who documented New York's jazz scene in the early 1950s. Model, known for her street photography, aimed to capture the full American experience through the genre, from the rapture of audiences to the wariness of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. Her project, intended to include an essay by Langston Hughes, was abandoned after she came under suspicion during the McCarthy era. The collection of 1,800 negatives reveals a poignant connection between Model, who fled the Nazis, and her subjects, who faced racism and persecution in the U.S.</p>
