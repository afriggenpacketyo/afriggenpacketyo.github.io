          <p>A high-profile robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves stole nine "priceless" jewels in under seven minutes, has become a viral phenomenon online. The event has inspired a wave of memes, social media trends, and even tongue-in-cheek advertisements from brands like IKEA and Böcker. While French authorities continue their investigation into the $102 million theft, the public's fascination highlights a cultural preference for dramatic crime stories over more tragic news. The heist's cinematic quality has captured the internet's imagination, turning a major crime into a source of entertainment.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 loss to Donald Trump, calling him a "tyrant" and asserting her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct. When asked directly about a future run, she replied "possibly" but said it is not her current focus. Recent polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited enthusiasm for another Harris campaign in 2028.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, sometimes called the "VOO and chill" approach, may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. Financial strategists note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated, with the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index's weight. As a result, investors are increasingly looking toward other areas, such as small-cap stocks, to find better diversification. The Russell 2000 small-cap index recently hit an all-time high, suggesting a broadening of market interest beyond large-cap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that the European Union is actively working to end its strategic reliance on rare earth elements imported from China. These materials are crucial for producing high-tech goods like smartphones, electric vehicles, and military equipment. Recent export curbs by Beijing have caused significant economic damage and production suspensions for some EU companies. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources, increasing recycling efforts, and forming partnerships with other raw material-producing countries to bolster its industrial independence.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that for many people, one of the best financial moves isn't picking stocks but buying household consumables in bulk. He argues that saving a significant percentage on items like toothpaste and toilet paper over a year can yield a better and more reliable return than trying to navigate the complexities of the stock market. Cuban emphasizes that this strategy is a practical way to save money, rooted in his own experiences of being broke in his 20s. He also cautions that such savings are only a true investment if made with cash, not by accumulating credit card debt.</p>

          <p>A year after the removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, the largest such project in U.S. history, the ecosystem is showing remarkable signs of healing. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning to the area. To mark the milestone, a group of Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the river's full length in over 100 years. This successful restoration project is now serving as a model and inspiration for Indigenous-led river conservation movements worldwide.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, buoyed by better-than-expected inflation data and a strong start to the earnings season. The September Consumer Price Index report showed cooler inflation than anticipated, increasing the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Corporate earnings have also been robust, with 87% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far beating expectations. This positive financial news overshadowed ongoing concerns about the federal government shutdown and trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, the Octagon House is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest residences, with a rich history and a reputation for being haunted. Completed in 1801, the home temporarily housed President James Madison and his wife Dolley after the British burned the White House in 1814; it was there that Madison signed the treaty ending the War of 1812. Over the centuries, occupants and visitors have reported unexplained phenomena, such as doors opening on their own and the scent of lilacs associated with Dolley Madison. The historic building is now a museum undergoing renovations.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Omaha to Los Angeles made an abrupt emergency landing just 18 minutes after takeoff due to a misunderstanding between the pilots and cabin crew. According to ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who was a passenger, a flight attendant's microphone was accidentally left open, creating static that prevented communication. When flight attendants banged on the cockpit door to get the pilots' attention, the pilots feared a security breach and initiated an emergency descent. The plane landed safely, surrounded by police, and the issue was quickly resolved as a technical mishap.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. While votes were still being counted, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a former barrister and lawmaker, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza and was backed by several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, and will become the third woman to hold the post.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize rest, revealed its pitfalls when a recent Amazon Web Services outage caused high-tech beds to malfunction. Owners of the $3,000 Eight Sleep mattress cover reported their beds being stuck at freezing or boiling temperatures, or locked in an upright position, because the system relies on a cloud connection. The incident underscores the vulnerabilities of an expanding sleep-tech industry, which offers everything from smart eye masks to neurotech headbands. While some devices can help with medical conditions, the increasing dependence on technology introduces new potential points of failure.</p>
