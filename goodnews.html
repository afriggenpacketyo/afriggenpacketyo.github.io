Speaking on "The Drew Barrymore Show," Bertinelli explained that her "Hot In Cleveland" co-star taught her to be thankful for all life experiences, including the difficult ones, as they provide opportunities for learning and growth. Bertinelli has been open about her recent personal struggles, including an "emotionally excruciating" period and her efforts to maintain sobriety.

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old. This makes the space rock about 20 million years older than our own planet. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the meteorite, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists plan to officially name it the "McDonough Meteorite," marking the 27th such rock recovered in Georgia and highlighting how modern technology is helping to recover more of these celestial visitors.</p>

The SpaceX Dragon capsule carried NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov. The crew completed a 148-day mission, conducting numerous scientific experiments in microgravity. Their return marks the first NASA-sponsored crew landing in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure discarded spacecraft components land away from populated areas.</p>

          <p>Dodge has announced a significant powertrain shift for its 2026 Durango model, making a Hemi V8 engine standard across all trim levels. This move eliminates the V6 option and positions the Durango as a performance-focused SUV, with the entry-level GT now featuring a 5.7-liter Hemi. The decision aligns with the brand's strategy of emphasizing combustion engine performance, even as the industry moves toward electrification. Additionally, Dodge is introducing a highly customizable SRT Hellcat Jailbreak edition, offering millions of potential configuration combinations to buyers, with deliveries expected in late 2025.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the heavily fortified inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers earlier in the week, a move initiated by the new liberal government in Seoul to de-escalate tensions. For months, the two nations had engaged in a tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaign, blasting propaganda messages and K-pop from the South, and irritating noises from the North. While a positive step, tensions may rise again with upcoming U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, which Pyongyang views as a provocation.</p>
