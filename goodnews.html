          <p>Robert F.

He emphasized that the report would not harm farmers' businesses, particularly those relying on glyphosate. Kennedy acknowledged the widespread use of glyphosate in U.S. agriculture and assured that the commission would propose pro-innovation policies to address concerns about environmental toxins without implementing restrictive regulations. His adviser, Calley Means, stated the report aims to highlight areas of broad scientific agreement regarding toxins affecting children, including pesticides, ultra-processed foods, and added sugars.</p>

          <p>Apple has approved the return of Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, five years after the game was removed for violating Apple's in-app payment policies.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence in low-risk groups. Vaccine makers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to "all healthy persons" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old.</p>
