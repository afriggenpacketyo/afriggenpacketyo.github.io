          <p>High-speed trains between Cologne and Berlin have been canceled for two weeks due to the installation of a new electronic signal box at Cologne railway station. The disruption, lasting until May 19, affects trains to Brussels, which are being diverted. Six regional express lines, six regional railway lines, and several suburban railway routes are also impacted. However, services connecting Hamburg, Bremen, and Cologne will continue to operate as normal. Cologne Central Station, a major European transport hub, serves approximately 180,000 passengers daily.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot managed to land the plane near the Itanomas River, and the survivors stood on top of the plane, surrounded by alligators. They ate cassava flour brought by one of the passengers and awaited rescue. Fishermen eventually discovered the craft, and a helicopter transported the survivors to the hospital; the pilot believed petrol leaking from the plane had kept the predators at bay.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test in an election amid trade war concerns. The People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled since 1965, is expected to retain power, but the opposition is gaining traction. The election is crucial for assessing Wong's leadership and the PAP's popularity. Singapore faces potential economic challenges due to trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with concerns over rising living costs and housing availability also influencing voters. The vote is compulsory in Singapore.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the MP for York Outer, is urging a rethink on the ban of alcohol consumption in football stands, suggesting a modern approach to the issue. Legislation from 1985 prohibits fans from drinking alcohol in view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football. Charters proposes limited trials to assess the impact of lifting the restrictions, drawing comparisons with other sports and countries where alcohol consumption is permitted. The Football Supporters Association supports the call for trials, highlighting the need for a conversation about responsible drinking in football stadiums.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a US man, Tim Friede, who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Friede endured over 200 bites and 700 injections from some of the world's deadliest snakes. The antibodies found in his blood have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. This discovery could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the global issue of snakebites that cause numerous deaths and disabilities annually.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency. This intervention comes before the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts may be discussed. Similar interventions are expected if the US cuts interest rates, potentially driving more capital into Hong Kong.</p>
