          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by more than half a second. Norris described the lap as near-perfect and stated he felt a return to his old form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to give him a better feel for the car. His championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri will start in third, while rival Max Verstappen of Red Bull had a difficult session, qualifying in seventh.</p>

          <p>The wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a stark divide in the city. While the event drew A-list celebrities and was dubbed the "wedding of the year" by Italian media, it also sparked protests from local activists. Demonstrators raised concerns about over-tourism, climate change, and the city being used as a "playground for billionaires," even as city officials welcomed the event as high-quality tourism. In a gesture of goodwill, Bezos reportedly donated around three million euros to organizations working to preserve the fragile city.</p>

          <p>Indian opener Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international century, leading her team to a dominant 97-run victory against England at Trent Bridge. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score ever conceded by England in the format. England's batting lineup crumbled in response, collapsing to 113 all out, with debutante spinner Shree Charani taking four wickets. The result marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and highlights significant challenges for the team early in the five-match series.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people marched in the Budapest Pride parade, defying a government ban and demonstrating against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's restrictive policies toward the LGBTQ+ community. Organizers estimated a record turnout of up to 200,000 participants, who risked fines under a new "child protection" law used to outlaw the event. The march, supported by the city's mayor and numerous EU officials, has become a broader symbol of resistance against what critics see as an erosion of democratic rights and civil liberties in Hungary under Orban's nationalist government.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its food products by the end of 2027. This move aligns the company with other major food producers like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar commitments amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of synthetic dyes. While many of Smucker's products, such as Uncrustables, are already free from these additives, the change will affect items like sugar-free jams and some products from its recently acquired Hostess brand, including Twinkies and Snoballs.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions started their Australian tour with a high-scoring victory over the Western Force, but the performance was not without issues. The team showed an exciting, attacking style but was hampered by a high penalty count and a potentially significant hamstring injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams. Head coach Andy Farrell acknowledged the need for more composure, particularly at the breakdown. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a major positive, putting him in contention for a key role in the upcoming Test series against Australia.</p>

The drugs were discovered hidden beneath dozens of shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The UK's Home Office stated this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record. Officials noted that container ships are a primary method used by criminal organizations to smuggle drugs into the UK, which is considered one of Europe's largest cocaine markets, and this seizure is a significant blow to their operations.</p>
