          <p>Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt has commented on long-standing rumors of a feud with her "I Know What You Did Last Summer" co-star, Sarah Michelle Gellar. Hewitt stated she has not spoken to Gellar since the movie's release when she was 18, dismissing the speculation as a manufactured narrative. The rumors intensified after Gellar made seemingly curt remarks and omitted Hewitt from a social media post, which she later explained were due to NDA concerns and an Instagram tagging issue. Despite not interacting at a recent premiere, both actresses have publicly expressed positive sentiments toward one another, attempting to quell the persistent online gossip.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of people considered missing following devastating floods earlier in the month. Through extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies, the count of unaccounted-for individuals has dropped from a peak of over 160 to just three. Many who were initially reported missing have since been verified as safe. This update brings a measure of relief to the community, which suffered 107 fatalities in the disaster, part of a statewide death toll exceeding 130. Authorities expressed gratitude for the tireless efforts of the more than 1,000 responders involved in the recovery operations.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try win against the US Eagles in a match marked by significant weather delays in Washington D.C. Despite the challenging humidity and lightning interruptions, the English side, featuring several new players, demonstrated superior precision and control. The US team struggled, committing errors that led to several of England's tries, including an early score after a US player was sin-binned. England established a 19-0 lead by halftime and continued to dominate, finishing with a final score of 38-5. The event drew a record crowd for a women's game and a large attendance for the men's match.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes New Law to Preemptively Target Potential Mass Attackers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 20:07:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans for a new law aimed at stopping violent individuals before they can carry out mass attacks. The proposed legislation would target those who plan mass killings but lack a specific ideological motive, a gap exposed by the Southport attack. Currently, terror suspects can be jailed for life for preparing an attack, but this doesn't apply to individuals without a clear ideology. The new power would allow police to apprehend suspects for preparatory actions, such as researching a target, mirroring existing counter-terrorism laws. This move aims to address the growing threat from lone, violence-obsessed individuals radicalized online.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned midair. While performing her song "Roar" suspended above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption as the prop was safely guided back to the stage. The incident, captured in multiple fan videos, is a reminder of the risks involved in complex stage productions that utilize aerial mechanics. Perry handled the situation professionally, continuing her show for the arena audience.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A discussion is growing in the UK about the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, alleviate holiday hunger for children on free school meals, and ease the childcare and financial burden on working parents. However, many teachers oppose the idea, viewing the long break as essential for recharging and planning. While some school districts are already moving to a five-week summer and a two-week October half-term, public opinion remains divided, with concerns about how any changes would impact family holiday costs and scheduling.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that savers are missing out on financial rewards by favoring cash accounts over stocks and shares, partly due to overly negative risk warnings. The government plans to launch a new campaign, reminiscent of the 1980s "Tell Sid" ads, to promote investment and will require banks to inform customers with money in low-interest accounts about investment opportunities. The discussion also includes potentially reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize a shift to stocks and shares ISAs. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that a poorly timed push could backfire if new investors face immediate market losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new generation of private members-only clubs, such as Soho House, is emerging in India, catering to the country's growing class of young entrepreneurs and creative professionals. These modern clubs offer a more relaxed and contemporary alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which often have long waiting lists and cater to an older, more established elite. The new spaces provide not only luxury amenities but also valuable networking and community-building opportunities for a new-money demographic. While membership is based on accomplishment rather than lineage, the high costs ensure these clubs remain exclusive playgrounds for the newly affluent.</p>

          <p>A widely circulated image claiming to show Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein posing with a young girl has been confirmed as a fake, created using artificial intelligence. The image, which has resurfaced multiple times on social media, contains several telltale signs of AI generation, such as deformed hands, distorted faces in the background, and unnatural body positioning. A reverse-image search revealed a full version of the picture with even more obvious AI flaws. While authentic photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from the past, this specific, incriminating image is a fabrication and serves as an example of AI-driven misinformation.</p>

          <p>A new season of the Iowa Public Radio podcast "Unsettled" examines the multifaceted gender gap in the United States, moving beyond the pay gap to explore divides in politics, education, and concepts of masculinity. The series was inspired by the growing gender divide in voting patterns among young people, which has been amplified by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the influence of social media. The podcast also delves into the education achievement gap, where boys are increasingly falling behind, and concludes by featuring diverse male voices discussing what it means to be a man in 2025, advocating for a more authentic and less rigid definition of manhood.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030. This marks the first time the government has set a specific reduction target, responding to public outcry over waterway pollution. The announcement follows new data showing that serious pollution incidents by water companies in England rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The pledge is part of a broader plan to reform the water sector, which also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution. The move comes amid widespread scrutiny of water firms for pollution, rising bills, and executive bonuses.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of the Open Championship, building a four-shot lead heading into the final day of the tournament. With a third-round 67, he moved to 14 under par, demonstrating the relentless and unflappable form that has defined his recent dominance in golf. Despite a brief challenge from Matt Fitzpatrick, Scheffler pulled away on the back nine with key birdies and remarkable par saves. Given his history of converting 54-hole leads into victories, Scheffler is now the overwhelming favorite to win his fourth major title, creating an air of inevitability around what would be a historic achievement.</p>
