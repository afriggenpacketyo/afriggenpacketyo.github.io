          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, reversing his detention by ICE. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations. The judge cited concerns over the constitutionality of the government's justification for detaining Khalil, stating that it appeared to be a punishment for his protests against Israel's actions in Gaza. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his wife expressed relief at his impending return home to their family, while the White House maintains Khalil engaged in fraud and misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers in Jacksonville, Florida, experienced a brief radar outage due to a cut fiber optic line, but a backup system prevented any flight disruptions. The FAA reported that the radar center continued operating on alert status while the primary communication line was down, and a contractor was repairing the severed line. Unlike similar incidents in Newark, New Jersey, there was no loss of critical air traffic service, as the backup system functioned as designed. The Jacksonville center oversees airspace across several southeastern states, highlighting the importance of reliable infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court's decision supports civil liberties groups' arguments that the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, have supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. The Louisiana Attorney General intends to appeal the ruling, and legal experts anticipate the case will eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
