          <p>The Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council unanimously recommended Onosato for promotion to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, after he secured his second consecutive championship. The formal ratification will occur at a JSA meeting on Wednesday, making the 24-year-old the second active yokozuna alongside Hoshoryu. Onosato expressed his commitment to learning and understanding the responsibilities of a yokozuna, while Tadamori Oshima, head of the council, noted the dignified manner in which Onosato wrestled under pressure. This promotion is the fastest under the six-tournament calendar introduced in 1958, and Onosato dedicated his championship to the people of Ishikawa Prefecture, particularly those affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.</p>

          <p>Video footage shows Brigitte Macron appearing to push away French President Emmanuel Macron's face upon their arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam, sparking online speculation. Macron's office initially disputed the video's authenticity but later downplayed the incident as a harmless squabble between the couple. Sources close to the president described it as a moment of levity before the start of Macron's Southeast Asia tour. Macron is visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore to promote France as a reliable alternative to the U.S. and China amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Five years after the anti-police protests following George Floyd's death, initiatives aimed at improving officer mental health are gaining traction. The protests exacerbated existing mental health issues among law enforcement officers, leading to increased resignations and burnout. Research indicates that police officers face higher rates of depression, PTSD, and substance abuse compared to the general public. States like New York, New Jersey, California, and Texas are leading officer wellness initiatives, with larger agencies creating dedicated wellness units and mandating training, and the tone of the article is based on the improvements being made to officer mental health.</p>

The author explores how language and narratives shape our understanding of the environment and advocates for a shift in perspective to recognize the interconnectedness of human and nonhuman actors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, America's democracy possesses several resilient traits. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, an independent judiciary, a constitutional system resistant to rapid change, a diverse and free press, a federal system of government, and strong free speech protections. These factors differentiate the U.S. from countries where democracy has recently declined, providing a stronger defense against authoritarian actions. While acknowledging the harm caused by Trump's actions, the author argues that these institutional strengths make the American system more defensible and worth preserving.</p>
