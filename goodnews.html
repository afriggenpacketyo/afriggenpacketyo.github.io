          <p>Nvidia shares surged in premarket trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue, despite challenges from U.S. export restrictions to China. This positive performance sparked a rally in global semiconductor stocks, including Tokyo Electron and SK Hynix in Asia, and ASM International and ASML in Europe. Nvidia is seen as a bellwether for the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks, and its strong results boosted investor confidence. The company's data center division drove much of the growth, although sales to China were impacted by export controls.</p>

          <p>Conflict resolution facilitator Priya Parker suggests asking "magical questions" to move beyond small talk and reveal people's personalities. These questions spark curiosity and elicit responses that help people feel like individuals within a group. Parker recommends asking questions that everyone in the group can answer based on their shared context. She provides examples such as "What was the first concert you went to, and who took you?" and encourages people to practice developing their own magical questions to foster deeper connections.</p>

          <p>Financial markets responded positively to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports, with U.S. futures jumping and oil prices rising. The court found that the law Trump cited did not authorize the use of tariffs, but the White House immediately appealed. Despite the uncertain long-term outcome, investors took heart after months of turmoil caused by the trade war. The ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen, and the Bank of Korea's decision to cut its key interest rate further boosted the market.</p>

          <p>Several prominent English rugby players, including Ben Youngs, Dan Cole, Alex Goode, Danny Care, and Mike Brown, are retiring from the sport, marking the end of an era. These players, who were key figures in England's rugby scene for over a decade, are stepping down as younger players replace them. Their departures signal a shift in the sport's landscape, with academy players increasingly taking the place of experienced veterans.

Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising, US stock futures jumping, and the US dollar making gains against safe-haven peers.
