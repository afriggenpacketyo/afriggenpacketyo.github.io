        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Fife nurse, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct after she complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities, leading to allegations of misgendering and failures in patient care. An internal hearing found insufficient evidence for misconduct, a decision that comes as Peggie's separate employment tribunal against the health board continues. The case unfolds amid a broader UK debate on gender identity, recently influenced by a Supreme Court ruling clarifying sex as biological under the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to advocate for a more equitable and orderly multipolar world. Speaking at a meeting in Tianjin, Wang criticized what he described as hegemonism, power politics, and protectionism from certain unnamed countries that prioritize their own selfish interests. He emphasized that the SCO, a Eurasian security bloc established by China and Russia, should defend fairness and the legitimate rights of its member states. The organization's traditional focus has been on combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism within the region.</p>

          <h2>German States Debate Fairness of Staggered Summer Holiday Calendar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 04:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is intensifying in Germany over the country's summer holiday schedule, with several states arguing that the current system unfairly benefits Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. These two southern states always have the last holiday slot, allowing their residents to travel during less crowded periods, while other states rotate their schedules. Critics claim this rigidity leads to higher prices and more traffic for families elsewhere. However, leaders in the south, like Bavarian Premier Markus Söder, are resisting changes, asserting that their traditional holiday rhythm is a core part of their regional identity.</p>

          <h2>UK Healthcare Review Recommends Renaming Physician Associates to 'Assistants'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 03:14:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's healthcare system has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to 'assistants' to prevent patient confusion. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests they should wear standardized uniforms and not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow a heated debate over the roles and responsibilities of these positions, prompted by patient safety concerns and cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The BMA union feels the review should have gone further.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that would impose a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the U.S. In return, Trump claimed the deal grants American companies unprecedented access to Indonesian markets with no tariffs. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed a "very good call" with Trump, agreeing to a new era of trade, but did not confirm the specific tariff details. Trump also stated that Indonesia committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets, as part of the deal.</p>

          <p>The 95th MLB All-Star Game was decided by a first-of-its-kind home run swing-off after the American and National Leagues were tied 6-6 at the end of nine innings.

Schwarber was named the game's MVP for his decisive performance. The new tiebreaker format, which provides each team's three selected batters with three swings each, was introduced to avoid exhausting pitching staffs in the exhibition game.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is ending the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which is nearly half the total force sent to the city. The troops were deployed in June to address protests related to the Trump administration's immigration policies, a move opposed by California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass. The decision to withdraw the troops comes after weeks of demonstrations and legal challenges against the federal deployment. Both Newsom and Bass applauded the withdrawal, calling the deployment a form of political theater and urging the remaining troops to be sent home.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has begun retrying Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues he acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, not to seize power. The retrial, granted based on evidence of torture during the original investigation, revisits a pivotal and polarizing moment in the nation's history. The case is being re-examined at a time when South Korean democracy is under scrutiny, potentially influencing how the court and public view Kim's controversial actions from 46 years ago.</p>

The initial failure of the procedural vote was a rare, albeit temporary, defiance of Trump's directive by some Republicans. The reversal underscores the president's influence over the party conference and puts the crypto legislation back on track for a House vote. (not investment advice)</p>
