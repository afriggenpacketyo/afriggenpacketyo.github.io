          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to boost the stock market, as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. While the People's Bank of China announced measures to support the tech sector and boost domestic consumption, analysts view these as stopgap measures rather than long-term solutions. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal policies that directly improve consumer sentiment and support the struggling real estate sector. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more focused on industrial and social needs rather than direct market support.</p>

The judge praised the video's inclusion, calling its message genuine and noting its impact on the sentencing. While some critics expressed concerns about the potential for manipulation and deception, others found it ethically acceptable, given it was used during sentencing and not a trial.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are calling for a revision of World War II history, arguing that the conflict's start date should be pushed back to 1931, with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism, which they believe has been diminished by the "Western-centric" view. The call comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end, with Chinese President Xi Jinping attending Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with Britain that will increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. has agreed to allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with a 10 percent tariff and remove its additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum. The agreement leaves in place a 10 percent baseline tariff that Trump imposed in April on almost all countries, signaling that he does not intend to scrap or grant exemptions from the universal tariff. The deal with Britain provides some hints for other countries on where the Trump administration stands on its tariff approach.</p>
