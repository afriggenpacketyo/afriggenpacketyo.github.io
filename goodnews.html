          <h2>Netflix Announces First-Time Use of Generative AI in Original Production to Reduce Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 04:54:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has confirmed using generative artificial intelligence for visual effects in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated the technology enabled the creation of a complex building collapse sequence at a fraction of the typical time and cost, making high-end effects accessible for smaller budgets. This move comes amid ongoing industry debate over AI's role, with unions and creators expressing concerns about job displacement and the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. The announcement coincided with Netflix reporting a 16% revenue increase, partly driven by the success of "Squid Game."</p>

          <p>The Shanghai government has announced a significant expansion of its shipyards on Changxing Island, aiming to cement China's position as the world's leading shipbuilder. The plan focuses on developing a world-class hub for high-tech marine equipment, with a target for advanced vessels like LNG carriers to constitute 80% of the base's output. This strategic initiative is projected to create an industrial cluster worth over 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion) within three years. The expansion is designed to enhance technological innovation and attract international partners to bolster its manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA draft, made his debut for the Dallas Mavericks in the Las Vegas Summer League, showing flashes of his acclaimed two-way potential. Despite a self-described poor shooting performance in his first game, the 18-year-old phenom bounced back with 31 points in his second appearance. Flagg's intense focus and commitment to winning have drawn comparisons to NBA stars like Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum. His rapid ascent through high school and college has solidified his reputation as one of the most complete prospects since LeBron James.</p>

          <p>A team of American archaeologists has unearthed the 1,700-year-old tomb of Te' K’ab Chaak, the founding ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. The discovery, made by professors Arlen and Diane Chase, is the first confirmed royal tomb found at the major archaeological site. The burial chamber contained numerous valuable artifacts, including pottery, carved bones, and a mosaic death mask made of jadeite, offering significant insights into the early history of the Maya dynasty. The artifacts suggest extensive long-distance trade, with items originating from as far as the Highlands of Guatemala and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

          <h2>India's Action Against Jane Street Highlights Fine Line Between Arbitrage and Market Manipulation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:53:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent crackdown by India's market regulator on high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has brought the complex distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into focus. Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences across markets, while manipulation involves intentionally distorting prices for unfair gain. Experts suggest the key difference lies in intent, or "mens rea," and whether a trader is creating an artificial price discrepancy rather than just capitalizing on an existing one. The case against Jane Street alleges the firm deliberately influenced a less liquid stock market to profit from its larger positions in the more liquid options market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The private space industry saw a significant influx of investment in the second quarter of 2025, reaching $3.1 billion, the second-highest quarterly total on record. This rally is attributed to sustained interest in defense-related space technologies and improved market sentiment, with U.S. firms attracting the majority of the funding. The report from Seraphim Space notes that space is increasingly integral to defense operations, a trend amplified by global security concerns. The sector is also seeing new public companies, with Firefly Aerospace filing for an IPO, indicating continued strong growth and investor confidence in space ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop High-Speed Infrared Technology Inspired by Fire Beetles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the heat-seeking abilities of the fire beetle. This bio-inspired technology is reportedly capable of detecting objects at speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, which could have significant applications in military and industrial settings. Fire beetles possess a unique organ that allows them to detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires miles away, an evolutionary trait linked to their reproductive cycle. The new technology aims to replicate this natural efficiency, providing clear imaging and detection through obstacles like smoke or fog.</p>

          <p>Despite engaging in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has outperformed its Middle Eastern counterparts, reaching a record high. After an initial drop following the October 2023 attacks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has rebounded, driven by strong foreign investment and renewed investor confidence. The country's robust high-tech sector, which accounts for 20% of its GDP, and a surge in defense industry interest have been key factors in its economic resilience. The market's performance reflects a perception among some global investors that long-term security and economic risks in the region are decreasing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by successfully building and operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. Zhang, an inventor since childhood, was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to build a vessel that could travel underwater. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) he had saved, he purchased steel plates and an engine, and secretly constructed the submarine. His creation, now a feature on his local river, represents the fulfillment of a lifelong dream to build machines that were previously beyond his reach in his rural environment.</p>
