        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who, even before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, recognized a critical gap in the Constitution regarding what should happen if a president becomes unable to serve. The amendment provides a clear framework for the transfer of power, a crucial element for maintaining governmental stability during a crisis. The piece delves into the historical context and the dedicated mission to get this vital amendment ratified.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 0.1% growth, according to preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics. This growth was primarily driven by the services sector, although it represents a slowdown from the 0.7% expansion seen in the first quarter. Despite the positive figures, economists express caution, suggesting the momentum is unlikely to continue due to a softening labor market and persistent inflation pressures. The data comes shortly after the Bank of England's recent decision to cut interest rates to 4% to address these economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's highest court has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, the creator of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The court determined that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp chant that is in the public domain, concluding a long-running legal dispute over the globally popular tune.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to an investment group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record-breaking $6.1 billion. This figure marks the highest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, surpassing the $6.05 billion for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The deal will see Chisholm's group acquire at least a 51% stake, with a path to full control that could raise the total value to $7.3 billion. The sale concludes a successful era under the previous ownership group, which purchased the team for $360 million in 2002.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startup company Voltify is proposing to decarbonize the $80-billion U.S. freight railroad industry by replacing diesel locomotives with battery-powered technology. The company has developed 'VoltCars,' which are essentially large sodium-ion batteries on wheels designed to connect to existing trains. Co-founder Daphna Langer believes this switch could save rail companies billions in fuel costs and help meet climate goals, but acknowledges skepticism from a traditional industry concerned about charging time and reliability. Voltify is developing a network of solar-powered microgrids to ensure consistent energy supply and is set to begin a pilot project with a major railroad company in 2026.</p>

          <p>A new survey by TravelPerk reveals that 55% of business travelers have had family or friends join them on work trips, a practice often called "bleisure." The trend is even more pronounced among C-suite executives, with 73% reporting they bring companions, including partners, children, and friends. Travelers cite motivations such as saving money on personal travel and reclaiming family time that would otherwise be lost to work commitments. While many companies quietly accept the practice as long as it doesn't interfere with work or incur extra costs, some employees remain hesitant to disclose their plans for fear of appearing unprofessional.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing the regulatory process for commercial space launches in the United States. The order directs the Department of Transportation to eliminate or expedite environmental reviews and cancel outdated rules for launch and reentry vehicles. The White House stated that inefficient permitting discourages investment and limits the competitiveness of U.S. companies like SpaceX. However, environmental groups have criticized the move, warning that it puts people and wildlife at risk by deregulating an industry known for powerful and sometimes explosive rocket tests.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline corresponds with a growing belief, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Researchers suggest that increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks, such as cancer, is a key driver. The trend is most pronounced among women and young people, with factors like cost and a shift in social norms also potentially contributing to the decline in consumption.</p>
