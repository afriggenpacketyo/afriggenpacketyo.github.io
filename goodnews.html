          <h2>Chinese Study of Feather Fossils Sheds Light on Bird Evolution</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The research team conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study emphasizes that an essential feature of bird evolution was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly. The optimism score is self-contained.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth may protect us from dangerous infections. The study shows that good bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers collected stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery rather than caesarean. The optimism score is self-contained.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara. The operation's onshore pipeline system suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015, leading to its shutdown. The court order halts restart efforts on the pipeline system until at least July 18. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. The optimism score is self-contained.</p>

          <p>Pregnant women are being advised to stop using weight-loss jabs if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK say it's not known whether taking medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby. The advice already appears in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely. The UK drugs regulator advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. The optimism score is self-contained.</p>
