          <h2>Camogie Association Faces Pressure to Relax Skort Rule Amid Sexism Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 19:37:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Camogie Association of Ireland is facing mounting pressure to allow players the choice between wearing skorts or shorts, with former All-Star Jane Adams labeling the enforced skort rule as "sexism." A recent survey indicated that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. A Special Congress has been called to vote on the issue, highlighting the growing discomfort and debate surrounding the dress code in women's Gaelic games. Some players have threatened to forfeit games rather than wear skorts, while others believe there are more pressing issues facing women's sports than what uniform is required.</p>
