          <h2>Luxury Brands in China Shift Away From Discounts to Restore Exclusivity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 04:27:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury brands are scaling back on steep discounts in China to rebuild their image of exclusivity and attract wealthy shoppers less affected by economic slowdowns. Data shows that brands like Balenciaga and Versace have significantly reduced or eliminated discounts on platforms like Tmall. This strategic shift focuses on cultivating long-term brand affinity by investing in relevance, desirability, and premium experiences, moving away from short-term revenue gains through heavy discounting. The change reflects a foundational move to foster long-term loyalty among consumers who value exclusivity and brand prestige.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal to reduce or remove tariffs on certain goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum, though President Trump's broader import tariffs remain in place. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for a limited quota of UK cars, while tariffs on steel and aluminum are scrapped, subject to quotas. The agreement does not change the UK's digital services tax on US firms, but both countries have agreed to work on a digital trade deal. The details regarding pharmaceuticals are still under negotiation, with both sides aiming for preferential treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>George Brauchler, the Republican district attorney for Colorado's 23rd Judicial District, is taking a tough-on-crime approach, drawing on his experience prosecuting high-profile cases. Brauchler recently secured a first-degree murder conviction in a DUI case, highlighting what he sees as a need to refocus on day-to-day crimes. He expressed concern that the criminal justice system has lost sight of its purpose, emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility for criminal conduct. Brauchler's stance is unique in the heavily blue Denver metro area, where he aims to enforce the rule of law and ensure accountability for those who victimize the community.</p>

          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing a surge in popularity, nearly doubling its result from the 2021 federal election with 8.8% of the vote in February. Opinion polls now place the party on par with the environmentalist Greens, driven by its focus on affordable housing and diplomatic solutions to the war in Ukraine. The party advocates for a nationwide rent cap and calls for negotiations and a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, criticizing Western countries for their "military tunnel vision." The Left Party's membership has almost doubled, reflecting its newfound self-confidence and growing influence in parliament.</p>

          <p>Former Australia cricketer Stuart MacGill has avoided jail after being found guilty of taking part in the supply of cocaine, receiving a 22-month intensive corrections order and community service.

The case emerged after MacGill reported being abducted and beaten in 2021, leading to a police investigation and subsequent charges against him.

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift away from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes as the U.S. and India near a trade deal, with negotiations progressing positively. Experts suggest that lowering trade barriers is essential for India's economic growth, facilitating foreign investment and global market access. While concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing, some analysts believe that certain sectors, like steel and pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly affected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to rising tariffs. Shipments to the U.S. plunged by over 21%, while exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%. Analysts suggest that the overall export surge may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were implemented. This shift in trade patterns reflects China's efforts to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs by diversifying its export markets.</p>
