          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first price drop in a year. This reduction will save a typical household ¬£129 annually, lowering the average bill to ¬£1,720. While this offers some relief, charities emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, owing suppliers a collective ¬£4 billion. The price decrease reflects lower wholesale gas prices, but concerns remain about the affordability of energy for vulnerable populations, especially during the winter months.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to a local charity. The lawsuit sought restitution for the cost of investigating Smollett's claims of being the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. The settlement allows all parties to move forward from the six-year-old case. The donation will go to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, an organization that provides opportunities for underprivileged youth in Chicago.</p>

          <p>With Japan's aging population and rising number of childless seniors, bequest donations are increasing as individuals seek to leave their wealth to charitable causes. Many elderly people are choosing to donate to hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and other entities after death, often due to a lack of heirs. Organizations are facilitating these donations by connecting donors with recipients through wills or trusts, allowing seniors to ensure their savings are used for meaningful purposes. This trend reflects a growing awareness of bequest donations and a desire to contribute to society.</p>
