          <p>The upcoming boxing match between Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Jake Paul is being presented by both fighters as a legitimate and pivotal contest, amid public speculation that it may be a staged event. For Ch√°vez Jr., son of a boxing icon, the fight is a serious opportunity to revitalize his career after a period of personal struggle. Meanwhile, Paul, a social media influencer turned professional boxer, aims to use the bout to solidify his credibility in the sport and silence his critics, insisting the fight is not scripted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay give the nation a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. The article notes that these platforms already function much like stablecoins, being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operating under a relatively mature regulatory framework. This existing infrastructure, backed by central bank money, positions China favorably as digital currencies become increasingly central to the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has submitted a formal proposal to impose international trade restrictions on all eel species under the Washington Convention, an international treaty governing the trade of endangered species. The move, which has met with strong opposition from Japan, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species such as the Japanese eel. If adopted, these regulations are scheduled to take effect in June 2027 and are intended to address the critical decline in global eel populations.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Japan Institute for Health Security suggests that consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age adults. The research focused on diets that regularly include rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, cooked vegetables, mushrooms, seaweed, and green tea. These findings indicate that this dietary pattern, characterized by a variety of nutrient-rich components, may provide significant benefits for mental health and well-being.</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have developed a contingency plan to allow international graduate students to continue their studies in Canada if they are barred from the U.S. due to potential visa restrictions. The program would enable affected students from Harvard's Kennedy School to attend the University of Toronto's Munk School as visiting students. This proactive measure was created in response to the U.S. government's recent move to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students, an action that is currently blocked by a federal court.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League's first non-pandemic remote draft was met with criticism from team executives and observers who found the format to be slow, awkward, and lacking the excitement of a traditional in-person event. Team general managers, including Ken Holland of the Kings, expressed a preference for the old system, which brought all teams and prospects together in one venue. The decentralized draft was plagued by multiple technical glitches, such as audio problems during the virtual congratulations between teams and their newly selected players.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, offering a minimally invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. In the procedure, a stent electrode was inserted into the brain's vasculature via a neck vein, which reportedly helped a 67-year-old paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. This innovative technique is said to significantly reduce surgical risks and recovery time compared to methods used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink.</p>
