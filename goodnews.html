          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful, declaring the actions "null and void." The ruling reinstates George Moose as USIP's acting president and criticizes the administration's use of force and threats to seize the agency's headquarters. Judge Howell emphasized that USIP is an independent think tank supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches, not part of the Executive branch, and that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The USIP looks forward to restarting its programs following the decision.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase will now allow its clients to buy bitcoin, despite CEO Jamie Dimon's long-standing criticism of the cryptocurrency. While the bank will not custody bitcoin, it will include it in client statements. Dimon reiterated his concerns about money laundering, lack of ownership clarity, and illicit activities associated with bitcoin, while also defending his clients' right to invest in it. This decision signifies bitcoin's increasing acceptance into mainstream investing, following Morgan Stanley's move to allow financial advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients since August.</p>

The company filed for bankruptcy due to struggling revenue and concerns over the security of genetic information. Regeneron plans to comply with 23andMe's privacy policies and allow a court-appointed ombudsman to review its data use. The deal aims to strengthen Regeneron's research into new drugs for serious diseases.</p>

          <p>French police have recovered the bust of Jim Morrison, the iconic frontman of The Doors, 37 years after it was stolen from his grave in Paris's P√®re Lachaise cemetery. The sculpture was found during a search related to a fraud case. Morrison's grave is one of the most visited resting places of a musician in the world. The bust, created by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was placed at the grave to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death. The Doors, founded in Los Angeles, were among the most influential rock groups of the late 1960s and early 70s.</p>

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a Wisconsin angler with a family history of shipwreck discoveries, has found the J.C. Ames, a 160-foot tugboat that was scrapped over a century ago off the coast of Manitowoc. The wreck, located just 9 feet below the surface, was identified as the Ames, a powerful towing tug built in Manitowoc in 1881. The Ames was deliberately sunk in the bay after being stripped and burned for its steel and iron scrap metal in 1923. The wreck is located within the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary.</p>

          <p>With credit card balances remaining high and interest rates unlikely to decline significantly, borrowers should consider strategies to manage their debt. Credit card interest rates are driven by a variety of factors, from the federal funds rate to the prime rate and more. Since credit card debt compounds daily, borrowers should explore debt relief options, including debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, and credit counseling. In some cases, credit card debt forgiveness programs may eliminate a portion of the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The surgery allowed the patient, Oscar Larrainzar, to discontinue dialysis, although the procedure comes with risks. The procedure was performed by two surgeons, Dr. Inderbir Gill and Dr. Nima Nassiri, who have worked for years to develop the technique.
