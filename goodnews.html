        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vox's Eric Levitz argues that Democrats should prioritize effective governance and policy solutions over simply focusing on populist rhetoric. He cites a poll suggesting voters prefer candidates who address corporate power over those who focus on regulatory bottlenecks, but contends that this doesn't negate the importance of "abundance" reforms like zoning liberalization and permitting reform. Levitz argues that improving the party's reputation for economic management and boosting confidence in the public sector's efficacy are crucial for long-term political success. Ultimately, he believes the "abundance" debate is primarily about policy and effective governance, rather than just political messaging.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has acknowledged that "frustration" led to his collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, admitting the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened." Russell had criticized Verstappen for appearing to deliberately drive into his Mercedes, leading to a 10-second penalty for the Red Bull driver. Verstappen's penalty dropped him from fifth to 10th in the final result, leaving him 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri. The four-time world champion was also given three penalty points on his license, bringing him close to a race ban.</p>

          <p>A major international trial has demonstrated that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can significantly cut the risk of dying. The three-year exercise program, initiated soon after chemotherapy, aimed to get patients to double the exercise guidelines for the general population. Results showed that exercising patients had a 28% reduction in cancer recurrence and a 37% lower risk of death after eight years. Researchers are now investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer.</p>

          <p>Vogue has declared the word "chic" to be dead, arguing that it has lost its meaning and been co-opted to describe superficial trends. The author suggests rehabilitating alternative words like "snazzy," "trendy," and "swish" to add linguistic plurality and make life more interesting. While acknowledging the usefulness and ubiquity of "chic," the author fears that it will outlive us all.

          <p>Policy experts anticipate potential changes to the child tax credit as the Senate considers President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package. The House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed in 2017, with a temporary increase to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. The Senate, however, may have different plans, leading to complex negotiations. This comes as the U.S. fertility rate hovers near historic lows, prompting lawmakers to consider financial incentives, like a bigger child tax credit, as a potential solution (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California is moving towards mandating phonics-based literacy instruction in schools, a shift aimed at addressing persistently low reading scores. A bill moving through the Legislature would require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading," focusing on phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The move comes after decades of debate and controversy surrounding literacy instruction in the state, with some districts already seeing improvements in reading test scores after embracing phonics-based learning. The bill has gained support from teachers unions and advocates for English-language learners after compromises were made to provide districts with more flexibility in selecting instructional materials.</p>

These changes, endorsed by Governor Newsom, aim to address the state's housing shortage and infrastructure challenges, but have faced opposition from environmental and labor groups who argue they would limit community input and transparency in development decisions.

The production team had to cut costs while maintaining the quality and historical accuracy of the series, ultimately shooting entirely on location in Tudor-era structures around England.

Instead of strictly banning AI, the author suggests offering students the choice to use it while requiring them to reflect on how it changed their thinking and learning process.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign flight paths, aiming for quicker flights, fewer delays, and reduced environmental impact. Ministers say the plans could allow planes to climb quicker during take off and descend more smoothly. The changes would allow the largest re-design of UK airspace since it was first formed in the 1950s, at which time there were only around 200,000 flights a year, with last year seeing approximately 2.7 million flights in UK airspace. Some community groups, however, have warned that the changes could result in new flight paths over previously unaffected areas.</p>
