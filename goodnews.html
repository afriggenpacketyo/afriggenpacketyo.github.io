        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City health officials have declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigations traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and response protocols, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the disease.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. A large-scale study involving over 200 GP surgeries in London found that patients examined with the AI device were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with these conditions compared to standard methods. The technology analyzes subtle heart sounds undetectable by the human ear, potentially enabling earlier treatment and better patient outcomes. The British Heart Foundation has praised the innovation as a "real game-changer," with plans for a wider rollout in the UK.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'The Toxic Avenger' Remake Offers Polished Homage to Troma's Cult Classic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, offers a well-produced and star-studded take on the 1984 Troma cult classic. The film follows a janitor who, after being thrown into toxic waste, becomes a deformed vigilante fighting a corrupt corporation. While the remake retains the original's gore and goofy humor, its polished filmmaking and sincere emotional anchor—with Dinklage's character trying to care for his stepson—create a disconnect from the gleefully cheap and offensive style of the original. The article suggests it's an enjoyable but tamer tribute.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team has secured a place in the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2002 after defeating Fiji. Winger Francesca McGhie scored two tries, continuing her impressive tournament performance, while Rhona Lloyd also added a pair of scores. Despite a resilient effort from Fiji, which scored three tries of its own, Scotland's attack and a stunning solo try from Emma Orr proved decisive. The victory sets up a crucial Pool B decider against Canada next weekend as the Scottish team continues its historic run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a controversial home run celebration has sold for $9,882 at auction. Rocco was initially ejected and suspended for flipping the bat after his home run, a decision that his family successfully challenged in court, allowing him to play in the state tournament. The incident gained national attention, with many major league players siding with the young player. All proceeds from the auction of the signed bat will be donated back to his Haddonfield Little League program in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>A recent concert at the Hollywood Bowl, titled "Sarabande Africaine," featured a unique collaboration between Afropop star Angélique Kidjo and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The performance explored the African origins of the sarabande, a dance form central to Baroque suites by composers like Bach and Handel. The show blended classical pieces with African drumming, Caribbean piano, and Kidjo's powerful vocals, reinterpreting works by Gershwin, Ravel, and Philip Glass through an African lens. The article praises the ambitious fusion, highlighting how the artists demonstrated a shared musical language that transcended cultural and genre boundaries.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1 billion for the upcoming Saturday night drawing, marking the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. The prize has grown after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner. Winners face odds of 1 in 292.2 million and must choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half the total. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%, in addition to applicable state income taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were exposed by receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought affecting the country for five consecutive years has lowered the water in its largest reservoir to historic lows, enabling the excavation of the Hellenistic-era tombs. While the drought has devastated agriculture and other sectors, it has provided a rare opportunity for archaeological discovery. The team is working quickly to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again by rising water levels.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Successfully Image 'Second Sound' Wave of Heat in Superfluid Quantum Gas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, scientists at MIT have successfully imaged how heat travels as a wave, a phenomenon known as "second sound," through a superfluid quantum gas. In normal materials, heat dissipates outward, but in these exotic, ultra-cold superfluids, heat propagates back and forth like a wave while the fluid itself appears calm. To capture this movement, researchers developed a novel thermography technique using radio frequencies to track particles. This breakthrough could provide insights into the physics of high-temperature superconductors and the interiors of neutron stars, where similar exotic states of matter are believed to exist.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old retired professor and author of over 175 books attributes his "razor sharp" memory to five daily practices. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress, lifelong learning by reading outside one's expertise, and using an organizational system like color-coded notes to manage tasks. Additionally, he maintains daily physical activity, such as swimming and walking, to increase blood flow to the brain. Finally, he follows a healthy diet rich in nutrients, stays hydrated, and ensures he gets at least seven hours of sleep each night.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, traveling over 9,000 miles from Peru to Australia in 139 days. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean overcame severe storms, injuries, and the risk of running out of food during their non-stop journey. Their arrival in Cairns, Australia, was celebrated by family and supporters. The expedition also served as a major fundraising effort, raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar through their family's charitable foundation.</p>
