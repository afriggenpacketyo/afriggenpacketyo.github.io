        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn F√©in leader, has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages following a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 story alleging he sanctioned the murder of Denis Donaldson, a British agent. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams, who denies any involvement, stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable. The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder, while the BBC expressed disappointment, citing the implications for freedom of expression. The legal bill for the case is estimated to be between ‚Ç¨3-5 million.</p>

          <h2>Study Projects Increase in Children's Cavities if Fluoride Removed from US Water</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 11:00:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Jama Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from public drinking water in the U.S. would result in an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years, costing $9.8 billion. This represents a 7.5% increase in cavities, disproportionately affecting children on public health insurance or without insurance. The study contradicts claims made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who advocates for ending water fluoridation. The research indicates that while high levels of fluoride can be harmful, the levels used in water fluoridation are safe and effective in preventing tooth decay.</p>

          <h2>Trump Responds Angrily to 'TACO Trade' Meme Criticizing Tariff Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump reacted sharply to the "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a phrase coined by a Financial Times columnist to criticize his tariff policies. The meme suggests that Trump frequently announces tariffs but then delays or reduces them, allowing investors to profit. When asked about the meme, Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and delay tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question "nasty." He argued that his actions helped China and denied that he was "chickening out."</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its childhood immunization schedule, stating that children with no underlying health conditions "may receive" COVID-19 vaccines, shifting from a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still recommends COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults, while guidance for pregnant women remains on the website, recommending vaccination due to their higher risk of severe disease. The agency deleted a statement that the guidance was recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC, and backed by outside medical groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania following the finalization of a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel. The deal aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania and involves a $14 billion investment, potentially creating 70,000 jobs. Senator David McCormick stated that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. government holding a golden share. The United Steelworkers union has expressed concerns about the acquisition, citing potential risks to American jobs.</p>
