          <p>Former President Donald Trump has claimed that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, a Hamas official indicated a readiness to reach a deal if it leads to a complete end to the war. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, representing a potential diplomatic development in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A veterinarian in Wisconsin has saved the life of a severely injured American bald eagle using an innovative procedure involving cod skin grafts. The eagle, found with a deep infection and a leg ripped open, was treated with sterilized fish skin patches that helped regenerate the lost tissue over a ten-month rehabilitation period. The successful recovery and release of the eagle, a national symbol, back into the wild just before the Fourth of July marks a heartwarming victory for veterinary science and wildlife rescue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the political strategy of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who is connecting climate policy directly to his core message of affordability. Rather than focusing on abstract concepts like carbon taxes, his platform promotes popular, tangible benefits such as free public transit and green school retrofits that also reduce emissions. This approach, which aims to build broad popular support for climate action, is seen by supporters as a more effective model for enacting and defending environmental policies.

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is promoting its free fishing days, allowing anyone to fish without a license on July 5 and August 30. The initiative is designed to give residents a low-cost opportunity to try the sport and enjoy the state's natural resources.

          <p>During his massive European stadium tour, Bruce Springsteen has been delivering a powerful anti-authoritarian message, which has found a particularly receptive audience in countries like Germany.

His poignant speeches, interspersed between songs, have resonated deeply with European fans concerned about the state of American politics.</p>

          <p>This article explains the key differences between privately issued stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) like China's digital yuan. While both are forms of digital money, the digital yuan is state-controlled, intended for domestic retail use, and managed entirely by China's central bank. In contrast, stablecoins are blockchain-based tokens issued by private companies, pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, and backed by reserves held by the issuer, operating outside of direct government control.
