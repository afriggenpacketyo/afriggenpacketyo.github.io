          <p>HSBC and Standard Chartered have successfully executed the inaugural yuan repo transactions under China's recently introduced scheme, which now grants overseas institutional investors access to the onshore repo market. This new framework facilitates the remittance of yuan acquired from these transactions for offshore utilization, underscoring a growing international confidence in China's ongoing capital market liberalization efforts. The development reinforces Hong Kong's prominent position as a key offshore yuan hub, particularly as Chinese bonds continue to demonstrate attractive diversification benefits and relative stability for global investors. HSBC specifically noted its completion of trades with onshore financial institutions to secure yuan funding through this innovative repo mechanism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A stress physiologist, drawing from two decades of research, posits that conventional self-care approaches to stress are often ineffective, with many individuals experiencing increased stress when attempting internal control. The article highlights "stress springboarding" as the "most underrated" solution, advocating for channeling stress energy outward through meaningful actions that benefit others. This method is rooted in the understanding that stress is inherently a social experience, designed to prompt connection and mutual support. Engaging in acts of service, such as aiding colleagues or volunteering, not only activates the brain's reward centers but also demonstrably rewires it for more effective long-term stress management, offering both personal and professional advantages.</p>

          <p>Comcast has officially named Mike Cavanagh as co-CEO, effective January, to serve alongside long-time leader Brian Roberts, who will retain his roles as Chairman and co-CEO. Cavanagh, currently the company's President, will also join the board of directors, solidifying his position as Roberts's trusted partner in navigating the company's strategic pivot towards future growth. This appointment formalizes a succession path, particularly after Cavanagh's expanded leadership over NBCUniversal's television, film, and theme park divisions following a prior executive exit. The move reflects a broader industry trend, mirroring leadership structures at companies like Netflix, which increasingly favor finance and operations-oriented executives at the helm of major entertainment enterprises amidst evolving market pressures.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is anticipated to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday, with its projected path indicating a movement away from the southeastern United States. As the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Imelda is presently causing tropical storm conditions and significant rainfall across the northwestern Bahamas. Despite the expected intensification, forecasters from the National Hurricane Center indicate a general east-northeastward trajectory, which will diminish the direct threat to the U.S. mainland. Nevertheless, substantial swells generated by both Imelda and the larger Hurricane Humberto are expected to affect much of the U.S. East Coast, posing risks of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia, in collaboration with the US-based firm Firebird and the Armenian government, is slated to establish a $500 million AI factory in Armenia next year, equipped with thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs). This ambitious project is anticipated to be a transformative "game changer," significantly enhancing local tech talent and elevating Armenia's standing as a notable participant in the global technology landscape. The facility plans to utilize surplus electricity from the nation's sole nuclear power plant, offering a strategic advantage. Experts contend that this AI factory will provide Armenia, a country with limited natural resources, a substantial competitive edge in the burgeoning AI economy, stimulating fundamental research and fostering new company development.</p>

          <p>A financial therapist strongly cautions against the popular TikTok-endorsed money strategy of "manifesting," asserting that "delulu is not a solulu," meaning delusional thinking is not a solution. While acknowledging the value of an optimistic mindset, the therapist emphasizes that concrete, actionable steps are absolutely essential for achieving tangible financial goals, such as accumulating retirement savings or eliminating substantial debt. This belief in manifestation's efficacy without action is particularly widespread among younger Americans. The article explains that perceived successes from manifesting are often attributable to confirmation bias, underscoring that true financial wellness necessitates proactive engagement and a well-defined plan, not just wishful thinking.

          <p>Maya Rogers, the CEO of Tetris, asserts that not all career advice should be blindly followed, stressing the paramount importance of trusting one's own instincts in making bold decisions. She illustrates this point with her choice to proceed with a crossover project with the Japanese puzzle game Puyo Puyo, despite an advisor's concerns about potential brand dilution. This decision ultimately led to a multi-million-selling series, significantly expanding Tetris's global audience and market presence. Rogers champions calculated risk-taking as fundamental for innovation and growth, a principle she extends through co-founding Blue Startups to support women-led and Hawaii-based businesses.

Instead, candidates should leverage their time with a CEO to pose specific, insightful questions regarding market trends, company culture, or how they can contribute to making the organization stronger. Porter emphasizes that he prioritizes a candidate's character and their capacity for critical thinking about the world, rather than solely relying on an extensive resume, as key indicators of a valuable employee.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market is currently undergoing a broad recovery, with its total market capitalization surging to $3.95 trillion, marking a 2.3% increase within the last 24 hours. A majority of the top ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are registering moderate gains, with BNB showing the highest percentage increase among the top five. Bitunix analysts attribute this positive momentum to the U.S. Federal Reserve's resumed rate-cut cycle, which is designed to bolster a softening labor market and is generally seen as supportive for risk assets like Bitcoin by enhancing liquidity. However, the market's Fear and Greed Index still indicates "Fear," and experts caution that near-term volatility remains elevated due to ongoing bubble concerns and geopolitical risks.

          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a significant 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free access to the U.S. market for numerous sub-Saharan African nations, is scheduled to expire on September 30. While the act facilitated positive growth in sectors like textiles and agriculture, its overall economic impact was somewhat limited and uneven across countries. The cessation of AGOA, coinciding with a resurgence of U.S. protectionist policies, threatens job losses in certain African industries. However, many economists now view this as a pivotal opportunity for African nations to strategically diversify their trade relationships, bolster economic independence through initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area, and cultivate new partnerships with global players like China and the European Union.

          <p>Amidst a notable increase in young American men expressing a desire for parenthood, a TV critic posits that sitcoms provide a unique lens through which to understand the evolving perceptions of fatherhood in the U.S. Historically, the "dad" archetype, significantly shaped by post-World War II family sitcoms, has continuously transformed from the stoic, suburban figures of the 1950s to the more engaged, co-parenting fathers of the 1980s. The 21st century saw complex, often anti-heroic dads in prestige dramas grappling with the meaning of fatherhood. Presently, the concept remains particularly contentious, balancing a progressive, supportive image with a more traditional, patriarchal vision, illustrating fatherhood's dynamic and ever-transforming identity in popular culture.</p>
