          <p>Reform UK achieved a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating Labour by just six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, a former Conservative councillor, overturned a significant Labour majority to secure the seat for Reform. This marks Reform UK's first parliamentary by-election win, signaling a potential shift in British politics, with Nigel Farage declaring Reform as the main opposition to the Labour government. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent.</p>

          <p>Roche has made a significant move into the competitive obesity drug market by partnering with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss. This collaboration aims to create both standalone and combination therapies, potentially challenging Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly's dominance. Petrelintide has shown promising early clinical data, with comparable weight reduction to GLP-1 drugs but potentially better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. The partnership is structured as a 50-50 co-development and co-commercialization agreement, emphasizing a balanced collaboration between the two companies.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a move expected to have major socio-economic and political consequences. This decision, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, reflects the government's commitment to societal values and interests. The census is likely to prompt demands for increased quotas in government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for various castes, particularly the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). While supporters argue that this data is crucial for implementing social justice programs, critics fear it could exacerbate social unrest. The last comprehensive caste-based census was conducted by British colonial rulers in 1931.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Center Health Program has resumed certifying illnesses linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, following weeks of uncertainty that disrupted treatment for some cancer patients. The program's administrator, Dr. John Howard, was briefly laid off and allegedly reinstated, leading to a freeze on certifications. A federal memo confirmed the resumption of processing enrollments and certifications, signaling a resolution to the delays. This restoration follows public backlash and bipartisan pressure, ensuring that responders and survivors receive the necessary care and compensation. The program is now reviewing and approving claims from those who developed new conditions linked to the attacks.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to expedite tariff talks, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal as early as June. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa announced plans for intensive ministerial discussions starting mid-May. While stressing that Japan would not compromise its national interests, Akazawa expressed hope for a potential agreement between the leaders in June. Discussions included non-tariff barriers and expanding bilateral trade and economic security cooperation, but did not address defense spending or currency rates. The Trump administration has paused new tariffs on goods imported from Japan until early July.</p>

The presence of fewer fish, or fish with deformities, could indicate negative effects. Cleanup efforts on Douglas Lake are about 90% complete, with over 112,000 cubic yards of debris removed.</p>
