          <p>The German cabinet is set to approve the first draft of the 2025 budget, which has been delayed due to national elections earlier in the year. This budget follows a major fiscal package approved by parliament in March, which included changes to debt policies. These changes are intended to enable increased spending on defense and a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure fund, addressing critical areas for Germany's future development and security. The budget aims to balance fiscal responsibility with necessary investments in key sectors. The approval marks a significant step in Germany's economic planning for the coming year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, stating that both countries had agreed to end their week-long conflict, though details from Iran remain less definitive. Under the proposed ceasefire, Iran would halt strikes on Israel by Tuesday midnight ET, followed by Israel ceasing strikes on Iran 12 hours later, with the war officially ending by Wednesday midnight ET. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested Iran had already stopped its strikes, but denied any formal agreement, stating the final decision on military operations would be made later. The conflict began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks on Israel and U.S. assets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, although neither country has definitively confirmed it. White House officials are touting this as a diplomatic breakthrough, potentially stepping back from the brink of a broader conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran would cease its attacks if Israel stopped its aggression, leading to a halt in Israeli attacks by the specified deadline. This development follows Iranian retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with no reported American casualties or damage from the Iranian missiles directed at a U.S. base in Qatar.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer emphasized that international law is at the heart of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government and its approach to foreign policy. He highlighted the importance of complying with international law to secure trade deals and address fundamental problems like migration. Hermer also defended Starmer's decision to maintain a warm relationship with the U.S., arguing it enables the UK to strike economic deals and maintain open communication channels. He noted that being a good faith player in international law is overwhelmingly in the national interests of the country, ensuring trust and cooperation on the world stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the Iranian government provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying Iran's response to U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the early notice, which he claimed made it possible for no lives to be lost or injuries to occur. Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran starting at midnight ET, following the Qatar strikes. Diplomatic sources suggested that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing over the weekend.</p>
