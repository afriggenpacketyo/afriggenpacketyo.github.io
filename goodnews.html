          <p>Germany is planning to tighten its border controls with several thousand additional police officers as soon as the new coalition government assumes office next week. Incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that stricter border checks and an increased number of entry denials would be among the first decisions made. Dobrindt received support from regional interior minister Tobias Strobl, who promised even tighter border checks by state police, including the use of surveillance drones. The coalition agreement includes turning away asylum seekers from German borders in coordination with European neighbors.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that politicians sometimes say things in the heat of debate that come across badly, and that Powell is mortified and does not want to undermine the experiences or arguments of those who have campaigned on or been victims of these crimes.</p>

Reform has demonstrated effective campaigning and a strong brand, but must now prove its ability to govern effectively. The Liberal Democrats and Greens also made gains in the recent elections, complicating the UK's political landscape.</p>
