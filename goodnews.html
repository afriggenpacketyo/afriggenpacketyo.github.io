          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in Earth orbit for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur around May 10th, but the exact location remains unknown due to the spacecraft's high speed. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield, has a good chance of surviving its descent and could make it to the surface partly intact, although the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia, as it is considered the registered owner of the object.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association after being banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a match. Vaughan, then 17, inquired if the player was a man and raised safety concerns with the referee. While the initial ban was overturned on appeal due to an unfair hearing, Vaughan asserts the case has negatively impacted her life. The FA has closed the case after the complainant withdrew, but Vaughan believes she deserves an apology for the stress and disruption caused.</p>

          <p>China's hit spy drama, 'The Secret Path,' has garnered attention for its realistic portrayal of espionage, thanks to guidance from the Ministry of State Security (MSS). The series, which debuted on state-run CCTV, features hi-tech gadgets and deadly props used by government agents protecting China's nuclear secrets. Director Liu Jiang emphasized that all details of modern spy warfare were produced under the MSS's supervision, with state security personnel checking every shot to ensure realism without revealing top secrets.

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google for changing the label of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following an executive order by U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum argues that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the part over the U.S. continental shelf, as the gulf shares borders between the United States and Mexico. Google Maps currently displays both names, but Mexico views the change as an alteration of its continental shelf's name. The lawsuit follows a House Republican vote to codify Trump's order, further escalating the dispute.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is preparing to unveil new plans to reduce UK net migration, which last year stood at 728,000. The proposed measures include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, visa restrictions for nationalities with a high risk of overstaying, and potentially longer waiting periods for migrants seeking permanent residency. The government is also reviewing how the 'right to a family life' is applied in immigration cases, potentially leading to stricter interpretations of international law.
