          <p>The sandwich chain Subway has named Jonathan Fitzpatrick, a former Burger King executive, as its new CEO. Fitzpatrick previously led Driven Brands, an automotive company also backed by Subway's owner, Roark Capital. The leadership change occurs as the fast-food industry grapples with reduced consumer spending and intense competition. Subway, despite being the largest U.S. chain by store count, has seen its market share decline and sales fall in recent years, presenting significant challenges for the incoming leader.</p>

          <h2>Understanding IRS Rules: Filing an Extension Does Not Delay Tax Payment Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:37:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misunderstanding about filing for a tax extension with the IRS. While an extension grants more time to submit tax forms, it does not postpone the deadline for paying any taxes owed, which remains April 15th. Failing to pay by the original date can result in penalties and interest charges accruing on the unpaid balance. The article advises taxpayers to estimate and pay as much of their tax liability as possible by the deadline and outlines several IRS programs, such as installment agreements, for those facing financial hardship.

          <p>England has named spinner Liam Dawson to its team for the fourth Test against India, marking his return to Test cricket after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger, and is expected to strengthen England's lower-order batting. England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and needs a victory in Manchester to secure their first five-Test series win since 2018. Pace bowler Chris Woakes will retain his spot in the lineup, holding off a challenge from Gus Atkinson.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group, allowing the All England Club's plans to expand the Wimbledon tennis site to move forward. The proposal, approved by the Greater London Authority, aims to nearly triple the site's size by adding 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on former golf club land. The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected. The All England Club expressed delight with the decision, which will also allow Wimbledon qualifiers to be held on-site.</p>

          <p>As gold hovers around $3,300 per ounce, market experts are debating whether it can reach the $3,500 mark before the end of July. After a strong rally earlier in the year, the precious metal's momentum has stalled. Some analysts believe a significant price jump is unlikely without a major new economic headwind or a change in Federal Reserve policy. Others note that gold can be volatile and that unexpected geopolitical events or shifts in trade policy could provide the catalyst needed for a surge. Central bank activity and inflation data are also key factors to watch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's soccer, as seen in Euro 2025, teams from Eastern Europe have struggled to achieve the same level of success as their Western European counterparts. This article explores the reasons for this disparity, pointing to a combination of historical, cultural, and financial factors. Experts suggest that a lack of investment, infrastructure, and societal acceptance have held the sport back in the region. However, there are positive signs of change, with increased funding from UEFA and local associations beginning to yield tangible results and grow the game.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has warned that public service media (PSM) is under a serious threat and has urged YouTube to help protect its future. The regulator's report highlights that children now watch significantly more content on YouTube than on all public service broadcasters combined. Ofcom is calling on broadcasters and YouTube to work together to make PSM content, particularly news and children's programming, more prominent and easier to find on the platform. The regulator also suggested the government should consider legislation to enforce this if necessary.</p>
