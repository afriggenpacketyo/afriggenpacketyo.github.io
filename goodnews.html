          <p>Reddit's stock price experienced a significant jump after the company announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both sales and future guidance. The social media platform's revenue grew 78% year-over-year, and it reported a net income of $89 million, a strong turnaround from a net loss in the same period last year. The company also saw a 21% increase in global daily active users, reaching 110.4 million. This positive performance is part of a broader trend of strong earnings from major tech companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's shares declined in extended trading despite the company reporting second-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue. The dip was attributed to a cautious operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, which fell short of Wall Street predictions. However, the company's sales grew by 13% year-over-year, with its online stores and advertising divisions showing robust performance. Amazon also noted that potential impacts from 'tariff and trade policies' could affect its future financial results, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties.</p>

The initiative is part of the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement and will be administered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>A plush monster doll named Labubu, created by the Chinese company Pop Mart, has become a major fashion trend and collectible item in the United States. Initially popular in China, the accessory is now frequently seen on purses and belts, driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements from figures like Lisa of Blackpink and Rihanna. This surge in popularity has led to astronomical growth for Pop Mart, with its North American revenue surging over 550% between 2023 and 2024. The dolls are being described by analysts as a 'gateway drug' to the company's broader range of collectible toys.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, reported an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion. While this figure slightly exceeded analyst estimates, it highlights the intensifying competition from rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which posted higher growth rates. Despite the competitive pressure, AWS remains a significant profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income for the quarter. The growth is fueled by the booming demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure and major corporate partnerships, such as a new multi-year agreement with PepsiCo.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has revealed plans to expand its platform into an 'everything exchange' by introducing tokenized stocks, derivatives, and prediction markets for its U.S. customers in the coming months. This move positions Coinbase to compete more directly with platforms like Robinhood by allowing users to trade traditional assets on the blockchain. The announcement coincides with the SEC's new 'Project Crypto' initiative, which aims to modernize financial regulations to accommodate such innovations. The expansion reflects a broader trend of tokenizing real-world assets, a development supported by the current administration's pro-crypto stance.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 16:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the potato, a staple starchy vegetable, evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient interbreeding event. A study published in the journal Cell explains that the modern potato inherited a key gene from the ancient tomato that enables the formation of its starchy tubers. This hybridization event combined the tomato's tuber-forming gene with a growth-control gene from a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile. The comprehensive genomic analysis of hundreds of potato species has finally solved the long-standing puzzle of the vegetable's origins.</p>

Analysts believe this increased capital expenditure will benefit chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom. While some analysts expressed caution about the scale of Meta's spending, the overall market sentiment was positive, reflecting strong core business performance and high demand for AI-powered services.</p>

The milestone was marked with a ceremony in Charlotte, North Carolina, a key growth market for the company. This strategy runs counter to the industry trend of branch closures that followed the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of online banking. The bank is targeting further growth, aiming to open another 500 locations by 2027 to capture more deposits and serve a larger portion of the U.S. population.</p>

The approximately $200 million construction will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with work set to begin in September. The new venue will have a seated capacity of 650, a significant increase from the East Room's 200-person limit, eliminating the need for large tents for state dinners and other major events.

          <p>On the opening day of the fifth Test at The Oval, England's bowlers delivered an inconsistent but effective performance, restricting India to 204-6. Bowler Josh Tongue exemplified the day's erratic nature, mixing unplayable deliveries that took key wickets with wayward balls that conceded easy runs. Despite challenging, overcast conditions that favored the bowlers, England's attack was often inconsistent and suffered a blow when Chris Woakes left the field with a shoulder injury. India's batters struggled to capitalize on the inconsistency, leaving the match precariously balanced after a day marked by rain delays and fluctuating momentum.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining high, homeowners are increasingly using home equity loans and HELOCs, but this article warns of costly mistakes. It advises borrowers to be cautious of variable-rate HELOCs, as payments could rise if the Federal Reserve increases rates, and suggests fixed-rate loans for those needing predictable payments. The article also stresses the importance of borrowing only what is necessary to avoid becoming over-leveraged, especially in an uncertain economic environment. Finally, it recommends carefully comparing lenders and scrutinizing closing costs and fees to understand the true expense of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a judicial conference, he argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass Congress, it inevitably leads to more legal challenges that require the court's intervention. Kavanaugh acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its process. He emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices, stating that even in disagreement, they are all 'patriots and good people' thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues.</p>
