          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong growth in wealth management and global markets. The bank's profit before taxation reached $2.103 billion, surpassing the estimated $1.905 billion, with earnings per share up 19%. While the article mentions the increasing global economic and geopolitical complexity due to trade tariffs, it notes that the earnings do not fully capture the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which were put on hold. Standard Chartered is also undergoing a cost-saving initiative, aiming to save $1.5 billion over three years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Runcorn and Helsby By-Election Heads to Recount with Reform and Labour Neck and Neck</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount due to a narrow margin of just four votes separating Reform UK and Labour. Triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, this by-election serves as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first major electoral test. Early results indicated Labour retained the North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties, but saw a significant drop in vote share as Reform came in close second in all three races. Reform hopes to make further gains in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and council elections, targeting councils like Kent and Lincolnshire.</p>

          <p>The Daily Telegraph reports that health officials are set to announce a trial that will expand access to weight-loss injections through chemists. This would make the jabs available to one in ten overweight people on the NHS, while over half a million people currently pay for private prescriptions. The Daily Mail also highlights the plan for over-the-counter availability of injections, including Ozempic, for ¬£9.90, the same price as an NHS prescription. This has raised concerns about the potential financial strain on the NHS budget.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene, which caused debris to cover many East Tennessee waterways. The data collected will help determine the impact of the debris on the sport fish population by comparing it to surveys from the past 30 years. Structures in the water, such as debris, provide fish with places to lay eggs, hunt, and feed, and the disruption in shoreline habitat may force fish to find a new place to congregate. Cleanup efforts on Douglas Lake are about 90% complete.</p>

He criticized subsidies and protectionism, stating that abandoning core principles leads to problems and loss of freedoms. Koch's political group has announced a $20 million campaign to encourage the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, despite previous disagreements with the president.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, formerly a senator from Florida, now holds four significant government positions, including secretary of state, acting administrator of U.S. Agency for International Development, acting archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and interim national security adviser. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his ability to effectively manage all responsibilities, particularly under President Trump's unconventional approach to government. The appointment to multiple roles is seen as a sign of trust from Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, but also raises practical concerns about workload and potential conflicts of interest.</p>
