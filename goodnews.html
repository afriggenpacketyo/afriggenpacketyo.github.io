          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom is seen as a timely distraction for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is facing significant domestic challenges, including cabinet resignations and dwindling approval ratings. The visit will feature royal pageantry at Windsor Castle and crucial trade discussions, with the UK hoping to secure deals on technology, energy, and reduced tariffs on steel and aluminum. Despite their political differences, Trump has expressed a personal liking for Starmer, which the British government hopes to leverage for diplomatic and economic advantage during a period of intense political pressure at home.</p>

          <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Houston Texans 20-19 with a last-minute touchdown drive led by quarterback Baker Mayfield. Mayfield's crucial 15-yard scramble on a fourth down kept the game alive, culminating in a Rachaad White touchdown run with only six seconds remaining. In the night's other game, the Los Angeles Chargers' defense dominated the Las Vegas Raiders in a 20-9 victory. Linebacker Daiyan Henley, despite being ill, set the tone with an interception on the first play from scrimmage and finished with 10 tackles, helping to stifle the Raiders' offense throughout the game.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited 'Hillsborough Law,' which will establish a legal 'duty of candour' requiring public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, officially the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, aims to prevent cover-ups and will impose criminal sanctions for breaches. It was championed by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, who faced decades of institutional obstruction. The law is also intended to apply lessons from other major scandals, including the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon scandal, ensuring better state accountability.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies secured the division title by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-5 in a 10-inning game at Dodger Stadium. The winning run came from a J.T. Realmuto sacrifice fly in the top of the tenth, which also extended the Phillies' lead over the Dodgers in the race for the National League's number two playoff seed. Despite a strong performance from starter Emmet Sheehan, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled, giving up four runs and three home runs. The Dodgers fought back from deficits three times, including a ninth-inning solo homer by Andy Pages to force extra innings, but ultimately fell short.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are increasingly using technology and personalized plans to track players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a 'fifth vital sign' of health. By monitoring cycles through apps and daily wellness forms, teams can adapt training intensity, nutrition, and recovery to mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps. This data-informed approach helps maximize performance and acknowledges the unique physiological needs of female athletes, moving away from a one-size-fits-all training model. Innovations include specialized nutrition plans and even 'cramp cocktails' of vitamins and minerals to help players manage symptoms and perform at their peak.</p>

          <p>MSPs in the Scottish Parliament are set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the controversial proposal to scrap Scotland's 'not proven' verdict. This unique third verdict in criminal trials results in an acquittal, same as 'not guilty,' but critics argue it is confusing and stigmatizing. The bill also proposes raising the requirement for a guilty verdict to a two-thirds jury majority, up from a simple majority. Other significant reforms include paving the way for a specialized sexual offenses court and establishing a new victims and witnesses commissioner to improve their experience within the justice system.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of accelerating the development of a unified national market, framing it as essential for gaining a competitive advantage internationally. In a recently published speech, Xi outlined key tasks, including cracking down on excessive, low-price competition and guiding industries to prioritize quality. The directive aims to break down local protectionism and administrative monopolies that hinder the flow of goods and resources within China. This push for internal market integration is seen as a strategic move to bolster economic resilience and efficiency amid global uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a 'framework' deal regarding the U.S. operations of TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The agreement, reached during trade talks in Madrid, could pave the way for American ownership of the popular social media app, averting a potential ban over national security concerns. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to finalize the details on Friday. While specifics remain scarce, reports suggest that technology company Oracle is part of a consortium that would enable TikTok to continue its U.S. operations under the new structure.</p>

          <p>In a move highlighting the escalating competition in the AI sector, OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, the former chief financial officer of Elon Musk's rival company, xAI.

The hiring underscores the growing feud between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but have since become bitter rivals. Liberatore's departure from xAI after just three months is part of a series of high-profile exits from Musk's AI venture.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, leading to some surprising results. Participants reported sleeping better, feeling more rested for school, and discovering new offline hobbies like baking and researching ballet lessons out of boredom. The experiment forced them to use their devices in communal family areas, which some parents noted opened up more conversation and gave them better insight into their children's online social lives. While the teens were eager to return their tech to their rooms, some planned to maintain new habits, like keeping phones out at night.</p>

          <p>While the Los Angeles Dodgers plan to use Shohei Ohtani primarily as a starting pitcher in the playoffs, the team's leadership has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in critical situations. Andrew Friedman, president of baseball operations, acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could necessitate using Ohtani in relief, similar to how starter Walker Buehler was used to close out the World Series. However, current MLB two-way player rules present a complication: if Ohtani enters as a reliever and is later removed, the Dodgers would forfeit their designated hitter for the remainder of the game.</p>
