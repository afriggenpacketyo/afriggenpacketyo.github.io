          <h2>Archaeological Find in China Suggests Existence of a 'Wood Age' 300,000 Years Ago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Science presents evidence of dozens of wooden artifacts unearthed at the Gantangqing site in China's Yunnan province. Researchers suggest these tools, dated to 300,000 years ago, indicate that wood was widely used during this period, filling a significant gap in the understanding of the Chinese Palaeolithic era. The discovery challenges previous assumptions, as wood typically decomposes, leaving little archaeological evidence. This find is being hailed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a world-class discovery that provides the first substantial proof of an East Asian 'Wood Age,' redefining knowledge of early human technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small meteor that illuminated the sky over the west Highlands of Scotland is believed to have deposited fragments on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The UK Meteor Network (UKMON) tracked the object, which originated from between Mars and Jupiter, as it descended to approximately 12 miles above the ground. Dozens of local residents reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with some feeling their houses shake. UKMON has appealed to hillwalkers to look for the meteorites, though they acknowledge the search will be difficult across the vast, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <h2>Preservationists Race to Salvage Historic Chimneys from Homes Destroyed in Los Angeles Wildfires</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Los Angeles's Pacific Palisades, a non-profit initiative called Project Chimney is working to salvage and relocate the surviving chimneys from architecturally significant homes destroyed by recent wildfires. Led by artist Evan Hall, the project aims to use these structures, some designed by famed architects like Richard Neutra, to create a community memorial. The team is facing a tight deadline from the Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the cleanup of the fire-ravaged area. The effort is a logistically and financially challenging attempt to preserve the memory of the lost homes and the community's history from the ashes.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to hydration multiplier powders, but health experts advise caution and emphasize that plain water remains the best option for general hydration. Doctors suggest these supplements can be beneficial for replenishing electrolytes lost through sweat during strenuous exercise lasting over an hour, but should not replace water. Consumers are advised to check product labels for high levels of sugar, caffeine, and sodium, which can be problematic for individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. It is recommended that people with chronic illnesses consult their doctor before using these products.</p>

While the Pike, which operated from 1902 to 1979, developed a reputation as a gritty, adult-oriented destination, the futuristic, family-friendly POP lasted less than a decade after its 1958 opening. The piece explores the different factors that led to their respective demises, including competition from Disneyland, the high cost of seaside maintenance, and shifting cultural tastes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that in the face of rising criticism from both the left and right, the best defense for liberal democracy is the concept of "value pluralism," as articulated by philosopher Isaiah Berlin. This idea holds that legitimate human values, such as liberty and equality or justice and mercy, are diverse and often in conflict, making a single utopian society impossible. Because no single vision of the good life is definitively correct, society must prioritize individual freedom and collective decision-making through democracy. The analysis suggests that remembering this philosophical foundation is crucial for defending democratic systems against totalitarian thinking.</p>

Its success is attributed to SpaceX's reusable rocket technology, which dramatically lowers launch costs, and its first-mover advantage in a technologically complex industry.

Companies like Sky Elements Drones program hundreds or even thousands of illuminated drones to create choreographed routines set to music, forming patriotic images in the night sky.
