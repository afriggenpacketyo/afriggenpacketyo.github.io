          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated that his primary objective for the approaching national election is to ensure the ruling coalition maintains its majority in the House of Councillors. The Liberal Democratic Party, along with its coalition partner Komeito, currently holds control of the upper house. Ishiba emphasized the importance of addressing the rising cost of living amid inflation and increasing rice prices, considering this election a critical test for his minority government. The Prime Minister also addressed potential coalition hurdles, indicating the need for policy alignment beyond just one agreeable item. Optimism surrounding Japan's political stability is tempered by economic concerns. </p>

          <p>Major US health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente, are collaborating to streamline the prior authorization process to expedite patient care. The initiative aims to create a standardized online system for submitting prior authorizations, reduce the number of claims requiring prior authorization, and accelerate response times. The changes, set to take effect in 2026 and 2027, are intended to alleviate administrative burdens on doctors and reduce delays for patients needing medical care. The American Academy of Family Physicians acknowledges the initiative as a positive step, with the ultimate impact to be assessed based on patient and physician experiences.

          <p>Three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion numbers in the U.S. are increasing, even in states with bans, according to data from #WeCount. In 2024, providers performed 1.14 million abortions, the highest number in recent years, indicating that bans have not stopped the need for abortion care but have made access more difficult. Telehealth abortions are on the rise, especially in rural areas, facilitated by "shield laws" that protect providers treating women in states with bans. Anti-abortion activists are challenging these shield laws in court, and access to mifepristone, a common abortion drug, is also under assault. Despite these challenges, organizations like the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project are optimistic about continuing to provide access to abortion care.</p>

          <p>Home sales in the U.S. experienced their slowest May in 16 years, with existing home sales down 0.7% compared to the previous year. Affordability remains a key challenge, with home prices significantly outpacing wage growth. Despite a rise in the number of homes for sale, the market continues to favor sellers in many areas, though the condo market is experiencing a more significant shift towards buyers. The median single-family home price in May was $427,800, a modest increase from the prior year. Uncertainty about the economy and job security are contributing to buyer hesitancy, though potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could improve market conditions.</p>

          <p>The government has outlined a 10-year industrial strategy that includes plans to lower energy costs for thousands of businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. This measure, which could reduce energy bills by up to 25%, is part of a broader strategy to boost economic growth and stabilize the UK amidst global challenges. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs for over 7,000 manufacturing firms, while the British Industry Supercharger scheme will increase discounts for energy-intensive firms. The strategy also includes measures to improve skills, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July, provided inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman believes President Trump's tariffs are likely to have a limited impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates. She supports adjusting the policy rate to bring it closer to a neutral setting and sustain a healthy labor market. Bowman's comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a potential shift in the Fed's monetary policy. This shift comes as economists express concerns about the impact of tariffs on inflation, though recent measures have shown little impact so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As more homeowners consider home equity loans, experts caution against taking on excessive debt, despite attractive interest rates. Financial advisors recommend assessing your entire financial picture, including debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and home equity, before borrowing. A high DTI ratio, low credit score, low home equity, unstable income, and lack of an emergency fund are indicators that a home equity loan may be too risky. Strengthening your financial position by paying down debt, building an emergency fund, and improving your credit score is advised before considering a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Existing Home Sales Rise in May Amidst Mortgage Rate Constraints</h2>

          <p>U.S. existing home sales unexpectedly increased in May, although the overall trend remains weak due to high mortgage rates. Home sales climbed 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.03 million units, but this pace is still the slowest for May since 2009. The inventory of existing homes increased, while the median existing home price rose 1.3% year-over-year. High mortgage rates and economic uncertainty are contributing to a subdued housing market, with first-time buyers accounting for a smaller share of sales. Economists anticipate that lower mortgage rates in the second half of the year could boost home sales.</p>

          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, analysts are evaluating China's potential role in the region, anticipating that Beijing will likely avoid direct intervention. Instead, China is expected to provide diplomatic support to Tehran as the US becomes more involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. The strikes have raised concerns about global energy markets, particularly regarding the Strait of Hormuz. China's approach is expected to prioritize stability and its economic interests in the region.</p>
