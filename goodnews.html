          <p>During a live broadcast of an American Hockey League Calder Cup playoff game between the Abbotsford Canucks and the Colorado Eagles, Canucks' announcer Brandon Astle was confronted by a rowdy fan who threw a chair, striking him in the leg. Astle expressed his frustration during the broadcast, but later apologized on social media for his handling of the situation, clarifying that the incident was not reflective of the Eagles organization or its fans. The Canucks secured a 5-0 victory, advancing to the Western Conference Finals against the Texas Stars.

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a significant issue in high-speed ground travel, potentially saving vacuum-tube maglev technology and shedding light on the challenges facing Elon Musk's Hyperloop. According to a study published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, even minor track imperfections can cause severe turbulence in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, the engineers say they have discovered a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, lowering "extremely severe bumps" to levels that are "pronounced, but not unpleasant." The researchers used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to reach their findings.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer advise routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision marks a departure from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone aged six months and older. While data suggests the original vaccine course offered protection against serious illness in children, the need for annual vaccines against new variants is debated. Experts highlight varying perspectives on the benefits and risks, particularly for children with underlying conditions or those living with high-risk individuals.</p>

It would offer incentives for other states to start their own versions of fire camps, expand occupational safety coverage, recognize incarcerated firefighters as employees entitled to wage protections, and provide $20 million annually for states to adopt safety and wage compliance.
