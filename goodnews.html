          <p>Wimbledon 2025 marks the first time in its 148-year history that electronic line calling will replace human line judges. While traditionalists may miss the unique charm and personality of the officials, technology fans welcome the change as progress. The absence of line judges may be noticeable on the iconic green grass courts, but players and umpires are already accustomed to the new setup from other tournaments. BBC Sport explores the perspectives of umpires, players, and line judges on this transition. </p>

          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on momentum among younger voters. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached the 50% threshold. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the general election, though incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent. </p>

          <p>A rare flooding event has transformed Australia‚Äôs arid outback, creating a new inland sea in Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, attracting wildlife and tourists. The flooding, triggered by Tropical Cyclone Alfred, has filled the lake for only the fourth time in 160 years. This has spurred an ecological boom, with mammals, birds, and plants thriving in the once-parched landscape. The influx of visitors has led to a tourism boom, prompting new regulations to protect the fragile environment. </p>

          <h2>China-Led Study Proposes Global Green-Energy Network</h2>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that a global solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands in 2050, producing three times the required power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers propose creating a network that leverages regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. The team acknowledges that establishing such a system requires navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease decarbonization, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes. </p>
