          <p>President Trump's tariffs have led to a surge in business for The Rodon Group, a Pennsylvania-based plastics injection molding company that manufactures toys like K'nex. The company has seen demand increase by nearly 50% due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, prompting consumers to seek domestic suppliers. While a U.S.-China agreement reduced tariffs, uncertainty persists due to ongoing trade tensions and legal challenges to Trump's tariffs. The Rodon Group has invested in automation to remain competitive and keep production in the United States, emphasizing the importance of STEM education and workforce development. The company's success highlights the potential for domestic manufacturing to thrive amid global trade disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifty trucks will spend five months transporting debris from the Lahaina wildfire to a landfill in central Maui, beginning next Monday. The debris, enough to fill five football fields five stories high, is the result of the deadliest U.S. wildfire in over a century, which killed 102 people about two years ago. The trucks will make multiple trips daily, following a route that includes a winding coastal highway and former sugar cane plantation roads to minimize traffic disruption. Maui County has evaluated the debris with the EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health, determining that transporting and storing it at the landfill poses no public health risk, with measures in place to control dust and contain the debris. The effort aims to address concerns from Olowalu residents about the debris remaining in their community permanently.</p>
