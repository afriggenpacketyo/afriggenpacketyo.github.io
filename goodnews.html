          <p>OpenAI is discontinuing its work with Scale AI, an AI startup recently backed by Meta, as Scale AI's founder joins Meta to spearhead AI efforts. OpenAI cites a need for data providers that are more aligned with current innovation and model requirements. Google is also reportedly severing ties with Scale AI following the Meta deal. Meta's investment in Scale AI amounts to $14.3 billion for a 49% stake, though without voting power. This shift underscores the intense competition for AI talent and resources among major tech companies. The article highlights Meta's efforts to enhance its AI capabilities amidst lukewarm responses to its Llama AI models.</p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle unit, Zoox, is increasing robotaxi production at its new manufacturing facility in Hayward, California. The facility is currently producing one robotaxi per day and expects to accelerate production to assemble 10,000 robotaxis per year at full scale. Zoox aims to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service using its robotaxis, which are currently being tested on public roads in several cities. The company anticipates operating between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities where it offers ride-hailing services, marking a significant step toward commercial autonomous transportation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Senate Republicans aim to pass President Trump's spending bill, key provisions such as the child tax credit are subject to change during Senate-House negotiations. The Senate bill proposes a permanent increase of the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, indexed for inflation, while the House-approved bill suggests a boost to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, reverting to $2,000 thereafter. Policy experts note that neither version would significantly benefit the lowest-earning families, with most of the increase going to middle and upper-income families. The final provision remains uncertain, but changes are expected before Trump signs the package into law.</p>

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit, is expanding its testing operations to New York City, though initially with a driver behind the wheel. The company has applied for a permit to operate autonomously with a trained specialist in Manhattan. While this is not a full-time deployment, Waymo intends to eventually bring its fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city. New York state law currently prohibits operation without a driver, and Waymo is advocating for a change to allow for driverless operation. The company is also expanding into other U.S. markets and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to additional cities in 2026.</p>

Hall underwent a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, avoiding chemotherapy and radiation. The two women met for the first time and discussed the impact of Munn's openness, with Hall collecting letters from other women who were similarly encouraged to seek testing.</p>

Experts emphasize the importance of partners being part of the conversation to ease this invisible load by initiating household tasks and engaging in open communication.

          <p>President Trump has announced that he will grant TikTok a third reprieve, pushing back its sell-by date for another 90 days. The decision comes five months after a federal law was enacted banning the app in the U.S. unless it separates from its Beijing-based owner, ByteDance. This extension will allow the Administration to work towards closing a deal, with Trump stating he doesn't want TikTok to go dark. The move follows a high-stakes meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials aimed at reviving stalled trade negotiations.</p>
