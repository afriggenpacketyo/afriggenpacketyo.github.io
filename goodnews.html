          <p>Clayton Kershaw pitched effectively to earn his first win of the season, helping the Dodgers defeat the Cardinals 7-3 and break a two-game losing streak. Kershaw gave up just one run on six hits over five innings, striking out seven and issuing no walks, marking his best performance this season. The Dodgers' offense provided support, scoring seven runs, and Mookie Betts hit his first home run since May 19.</p>
