          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates to operate in Northern Europe. The agreement marks a significant victory for the British defence industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting 10 unaccompanied children back to Guatemala. The order, which lasts for 14 days, was granted after advocacy groups argued the removals would violate U.S. laws designed to protect vulnerable minors who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. This legal challenge follows reports of a new agreement with Guatemala that would permit such deportations. The judge's intervention temporarily blocks a key component of the administration's broader immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including a $1 million ticket sold in Worcester, Massachusetts, and three other tickets in the state worth $50,000 each. This jackpot is the largest since April 2024 and marks the fortieth consecutive drawing without a top winner since May 31. The next opportunity for players to win the massive prize will be on Monday night.</p>

          <p>During informal talks in Copenhagen, European Union foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine as the war with Russia continues. Among the ideas discussed were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and a plan to establish Ukrainian arms production facilities on EU soil, creating a "safe haven" from Russian attacks. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops from Poland and Germany onto Ukrainian soil following a potential ceasefire.</p>

          <h2>Large-Scale Kelp Forest Restoration Off California Coast Shows Remarkable Success</h2>

          <p>A major environmental restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived 80 acres of giant Pacific kelp forest by removing nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins. Led by The Bay Foundation, the 13-year effort involved divers using hammers to smash the urchins, which had created barren underwater landscapes by devouring the kelp. The removal of the voracious herbivores allowed the kelp, a vital ecosystem that supports hundreds of marine species and stores carbon, to regrow rapidly. This project is now considered one of the world's most successful kelp restoration initiatives.</p>

His teammate, Lando Norris, was forced to retire from a comfortable second place with just seven laps remaining due to an oil leak, a development that could be decisive in the title fight between the two drivers. The dramatic turn of events elevated Red Bull's Max Verstappen to second place and gave French rookie Isack Hadjar his first career podium finish.

          <p>Germany is marking the 10-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which signaled the country's open-door policy for refugees in 2015. The decision led to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and has had profound, lasting effects on German society, culture, and politics. A decade later, the nation is grappling with the complex legacy of this policy, balancing successful integration stories with ongoing challenges related to employment and social cohesion.

          <p>In a personal essay, the author, a self-described liberal, makes the case for hunting as a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to factory farming. She recounts her own journey to becoming a hunter, detailing the emotional gravity of taking an animal's life and the deep connection to nature it fosters. The author argues that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with fees from licenses and taxes on firearms directly funding wildlife management. The piece challenges the reflexive disdain for hunting on the political left, suggesting hunters and vegetarians share common ground in their ethical considerations about food.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin recounts her journey of finding love and reinventing her life after her first husband died suddenly when she was 26. Initially believing she would not remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, whom she eventually married.
