          <p>Two Japanese soccer players are moving to Germany's top-tier league, the Bundesliga. Defender Koki Machida, 27, is joining Hoffenheim after a successful stint with Belgian side Royale Union Saint-Gilloise, where he helped the team win its first league title in 90 years. Meanwhile, 23-year-old midfielder Joel Chima Fujita, who captained Japan's U-23 Olympic team, is transferring to St. Pauli from Sint-Truiden. In another move, defender Daiki Hashioka has completed a transfer from Luton Town to Czech champions Slavia Prague, securing a spot in next season's Champions League.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. The minimally invasive procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature through a neck vein. In the trial, a 67-year-old patient paralyzed by a stroke was able to regain some limb movement. This innovative technique presents a potentially safer alternative with a shorter recovery time compared to the more invasive methods being developed by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, claiming the best record in the major leagues, but the victory was far from perfect. The team overcame a rough start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors that allowed the Royals to take an early lead. Key offensive contributions, including home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy, and a go-ahead RBI from Mookie Betts, were just enough to secure the win. The game ended with a dramatic bases-loaded double play, highlighting the team's ability to win even when not playing at its best.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and that the best plan for his development is to remain with the team. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, had a breakthrough season and recently signed a new five-year contract. Sources close to the player have also dismissed suggestions that he is frustrated at the club.</p>

The Wakayama zoo held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, finding that individuals who followed this pattern were less likely to exhibit such symptoms. The Japan Institute for Health Security, which conducted the study, noted that certain foods in the diet, like those rich in folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, could be linked to improved mental well-being. Researchers hope the findings can inform public health measures.</p>

The comedy follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial and romantic struggles with a cynical and manipulative edge. Sadler, the writer, explains that the show is influenced by their own upbringing, online culture, and what she calls the "bleak" modern dating scene. The series uses dark humor to explore taboo subjects like mental health and parental abandonment from a distinctly female perspective.</p>
