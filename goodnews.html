          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung has ordered the cessation of loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea in an effort to reduce cross-border tensions. In response, North Korea appears to have ceased its own loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South. This decision aligns with President Lee's campaign promise to restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea launched trash-filled balloons toward the South.</p>
