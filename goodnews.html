          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in intense negotiations to secure a post-Brexit deal, focusing on areas like defense, trade, fishing rights, and youth mobility. Sir Keir Starmer is meeting with EU leaders to finalize the agreement, with government sources reporting significant progress. However, some Conservative and Reform UK leaders criticize the deal as a "surrender" due to the lack of transparency surrounding the deal's contents. Discussions include British access to an EU defense fund, fishing rights post-2026, and a potential youth mobility scheme, which has faced mixed reactions from opposition parties.</p>

He also plans to engage with Elon Musk, a vocal critic of South Africa, to encourage investment in the country. Key issues to be discussed include the Afrikaner refugee situation, Musk's potential business ventures in South Africa, and differing perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers in fiscal year 2028 to enhance efficiency and security as inbound tourism continues to rise. Travelers from visa-exempt countries will be required to provide personal and travel information before arrival, allowing the Immigration Services Agency to assess potential risks. This system, modeled after the U.S. ESTA, aims to prevent individuals with criminal records or prior illegal stays from boarding planes to Japan. The government hopes to boost tourism to 60 million visitors by 2030.</p>

The strike, which halted trains for three days, affected over 100,000 daily commuters. The agreement was described as fair and fiscally responsible, with concessions made on work rules to offset wage increases. NJ Transit will use Monday to reposition equipment and conduct safety checks before restoring regular service on Tuesday, with contingency bus service available in the meantime.</p>
