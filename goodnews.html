          <p>A recent Japanese government survey indicates that approximately half of respondents believed false information encountered on social media. The survey, conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, examined reactions to false claims, such as mass beaching events signaling impending earthquakes. Internal affairs minister Seiichiro Murakami emphasized the importance of enhancing media literacy to combat the spread of unsourced online information. The survey highlighted a gap between recognizing the need for media literacy and actively improving understanding, as many respondents had not taken steps to verify online content before believing it.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally-ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The legislation requires two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness before they can receive medical assistance to end their life. First Minister John Swinney and other prominent figures have expressed opposition, raising concerns about potential coercion and the definition of terminal illness. Supporters argue the bill provides necessary safeguards and respects individual choice, addressing vulnerabilities faced by terminally-ill individuals who might otherwise take matters into their own hands.</p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China, several investment banks are increasing their China GDP growth outlooks. The agreement involves reducing mutual tariffs from 125% to 10% for 90 days, leading UBS to predict China's 2025 GDP growth could reach 3.7% to 4%, up from a previous estimate of 3.4%. Morgan Stanley also anticipates a potential increase in China's second-quarter GDP, expecting companies to expedite exports to capitalize on the lower tariffs, while ANZ Bank now sees potential for China's GDP to come in higher than 4.2% this year.</p>

While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei demonstrate innovation, China also faces sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. Experts suggest that technological advances alone may not be enough to overcome these economic imbalances. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding these dual realities to accurately assess China's position as a global power and its resilience in the face of trade wars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates imposed since April have been reduced, but a complex web of duties remains. While new duties have been lowered, previous tariffs from Trump's first term are still in effect, resulting in a baseline rate of about 50% for Chinese exporters. The 90-day suspension of tariffs provides some relief, potentially mitigating product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season, but pre-existing tariffs will remain in place. UBS estimates the total weighted average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products is now around 43.5%, including pre-existing duties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial technology firms, which benefited from interest rate hikes in 2022, now face a critical test as interest rates decline. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo saw increased profits due to higher net interest income, but falling rates raise concerns about the sustainability of this revenue stream. Experts suggest that fintechs with diversified revenue streams, such as Revolut's crypto and share trading offerings, are better positioned to adapt. ClearBank's shift from interest income to fee-based income signals the potential impact of lower rates on the sector.</p>

The Army Futures Command was established to foster innovation and accelerate the acquisition of new technologies, but its efforts were hampered by shifting priorities under the Biden administration.

          <p>A China-led international team of researchers suggests that liquid water may be present just a few kilometers beneath the surface of Mars. Using data from NASA's InSight lander, the team analyzed seismic waves from marsquakes and meteorite impacts. The presence of water-saturated rock could account for the planet's missing water, matching what scientists believe has escaped into space, become locked into rocks, or remains as ice and vapor. This discovery could reshape understanding of Mars' water cycle and potential for habitable environments.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how German companies, which invest heavily in the United States, are reevaluating their strategies due to trade tensions. While thousands of German companies already have factories in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in new investments and a more pessimistic outlook. Trump's tariffs are cited as a major factor, leading German firms to consider keeping investments at home, especially with a new government in Germany focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. The automotive sector is particularly affected, with BMW and Mercedes-Benz seeking to ease tariffs.</p>
