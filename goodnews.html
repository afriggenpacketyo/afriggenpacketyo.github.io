          <h2>Indian Researchers Win Ig Nobel Prize for Smelly Shoe Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 20:25:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have won an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on foul-smelling shoes and their impact on shoe rack user experience. Their research, stemming from observations in university hostels, identified Kytococcus sedentarius bacteria as the primary culprit behind the odor. They discovered that short bursts of ultraviolet light could effectively eliminate the bacteria and the associated smell. This led to the development of a prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack designed not just to store but also to sterilize footwear. The Ig Nobel award, which celebrates unusual but inventive scientific endeavors, has encouraged the researchers to continue exploring overlooked questions in everyday science.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in their $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit, which stemmed from his baseless claims of election rigging during the 2020 presidential election. His allegations, spread across various platforms, severely undermined public confidence in U.S. elections and led to threats against election officials. This settlement adds to Giuliani's significant legal and financial setbacks, which include disbarment as an attorney in New York and Washington, bankruptcy filings, and a $148 million order to two former Georgia election workers he defamed. Other conservative media outlets, like Fox News and Newsmax, previously settled similar defamation suits with Dominion for substantial amounts, highlighting the broader impact of election conspiracy theories.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, exploring various forms like oral supplements and topical creams. While some users report positive results, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin cells directly, given its large molecular size and journey through the body. The article notes that hydrolysed collagen (peptides) may have a better chance, but its destination is uncertain. Industry-funded studies often show positive effects, contrasting with independent research that finds no substantial impact, suggesting that sun protection, a healthy diet, and stopping smoking are more effective.</p>

This marks McGill's first final appearance in eight years, representing a significant achievement for the player who had slipped to 57th in the world rankings and had not reached a semi-final in nearly three years. He will now face England's Shaun Murphy, who decisively defeated defending champion Mark Selby 6-1 in the other semi-final. McGill expressed immense delight at his victory over a "legend" like Higgins, highlighting this as the biggest final of his career and a crucial step in his guaranteed return to the top 50 rankings.</p>

          <p>St Helens snatched a sensational 16-14 Super League play-off eliminator victory against Leeds Rhinos with a try in the final play of the game by Shane Wright at Headingley. The dramatic come-from-behind win came after an energy-sapping half where Saints played without forward Matty Lees, who had to leave as his wife went into labor. Leeds had led 12-6 at halftime and extended their lead with a penalty, but Saints mounted a stunning late turnaround, culminating in Jon Bennison's late touchdown before Wright's match-winner. The mesmerizing 16-pass move that criss-crossed the pitch secured St Helens' place in a semi-final trip to Hull KR, marking one of the season's most frantic and decisive moments.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether China has surpassed Europe in the race for a hi-tech future, marking 50 years of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union. Fifty years ago, Chinese officials, after touring numerous European factories, mines, and research institutes, observed Europe's advanced technology and industry, concluding China was at least two decades behind. This critical assessment spurred China's subsequent reform and opening-up policies, which ultimately led to decades of breakneck economic and technological growth. The article's truncated content implies a dramatic shift in technological standing since then, suggesting China has significantly closed or even surpassed that gap, reflecting a historical turning point in global technological leadership and innovation.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election, aiming to address the nationwide housing affordability crisis. A taskforce has identified 12 potential locations across England for development, with Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London highlighted as the most promising initial sites. Housing Secretary Steve Reed is expected to announce these plans, which are central to Labour's vision of economic growth and its promise to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The initiative will leverage development corporations with special planning powers, mirroring post-war efforts, and aims for at least 40% affordable housing in each new town.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion commercial loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain following a cyber attack that halted production for weeks. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan aims to protect thousands of skilled jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside, and throughout the UK automotive sector. JLR, owned by India's Tata Motors, has suspended production and orders with its 700 suppliers, costing an estimated £50 million per week and threatening small businesses. The Export Development Guarantee will boost JLR's cash reserves for supplier payments. While welcomed by unions and some politicians, critics argue the government was slow to act and call for a broader cyber reinsurance scheme to protect British businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
