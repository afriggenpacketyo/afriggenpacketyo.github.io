          <p>Japan's political future is uncertain as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba resigns, taking responsibility for recent election losses and a domestic cost-of-living crisis. Former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi is currently leading opinion polls, potentially becoming Japan's first female prime minister, with current agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi also a strong contender. Takaichi is noted for her strong policy ideas and support within the Liberal Democratic Party, while Koizumi is perceived as a safer, less outspoken choice. The incoming leader will confront pressing domestic issues and international trade agreements, requiring strategic governance to ensure stability and growth in a challenging environment.</p>

          <p>Japanese markets, including the benchmark Nikkei 225 and Topix, saw a notable surge following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend. Investors are assessing the political transition and potential successors, with agricultural minister Koizumi Shinjiro and former economic security minister Takaichi Sanae emerging as leading contenders. Takaichi, who advocates for deregulation and opposes interest rate hikes, is perceived as a candidate likely to stimulate economic growth, which analysts believe justified the market's "very positive response." This market rally unfolds as Japan faces persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy expectations, and fiscal uncertainty, making leadership choices critical for economic direction.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, has "unequivocally rejected" two preliminary expressions of interest in acquiring the north London football club, firmly stating that it is "not for sale." This announcement comes after speculation arose following the recent departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman. The rejected bids included one from Amanda Staveley's PCP International Finance Limited and another from a consortium led by Dr. Roger Kennedy. ENIC, holding nearly 87% of the club, reiterated its commitment to ensuring Tottenham's long-term sporting success and has no intention of selling its stake.</p>

The 22-year-old Spaniard meticulously studied his previous Wimbledon loss to Sinner, leading to an exceptionally consistent tournament where he dropped only one set across 22 played. This victory extends Alcaraz's winning streak to 13 matches, showcasing his remarkable ability to perform under pressure and adapt his game. His growing maturity and dominance across all three surfaces further solidify his status as a tennis prodigy, now just an Australian Open title away from a career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a positive opening, with investor attention keenly focused on France's upcoming confidence vote for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, who is widely expected to lose. The vote stems from deep disagreements with rival parties over proposed budget cuts totaling 44 billion euros, aimed at reducing the national deficit to 4.6% by 2026. Should Bayrou be ousted, President Emmanuel Macron would face the challenge of appointing his fifth prime minister in less than two years, signaling potential political instability. This European political development occurs as U.S. markets await crucial inflation data, which could influence global economic outlooks and central bank policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative China-US study, leveraging seismic waves recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has made the surprising discovery that Mars possesses a solid inner core, measuring approximately 600km in radius. This finding is particularly unexpected as Mars, unlike Earth and the Moon, was not theoretically predicted to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core. The presence of this solid inner core, which is proportionally similar to Earth's, could potentially reignite the long-debated idea that Mars might have once developed plate tectonics. This significant geological revelation advances our fundamental understanding of planetary formation and evolution, challenging existing models of Mars's internal structure and history.</p>
