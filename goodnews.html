          <p>Following a strong preseason debut for the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders publicly confronted an ESPN reporter, questioning his consistently negative coverage. The interaction, captured on video, was sarcastic but ended with a laugh, highlighting the intense media scrutiny surrounding the high-profile player. Despite the reporter's past critiques, he acknowledged Sanders' "outstanding" performance after the game, signaling a potential shift in the narrative as the Browns' quarterback competition intensifies.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, following a similar move by the South to de-escalate tensions. The South had recently halted its anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, which included K-pop music and critical messages, as a goodwill gesture from its new liberal government. This reciprocal action marks a potential, albeit fragile, reduction in the Cold War-style psychological warfare that has recently intensified between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Authorities have lifted all evacuation orders for the Canyon fire in Southern California, which has burned over 5,000 acres and is now 28% contained. Fire activity was minimal overnight, allowing crews to strengthen containment lines, though a regional heat wave continues to pose challenges with triple-digit temperatures. The fire, which started Thursday, led to the serious injury of a Kern County Fire Department battalion chief, who was airlifted to a hospital after a vehicle rollover.</p>

De Gea, who left United two years ago after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd, giving him the farewell he was not afforded at the time of his unceremonious departure. The match highlighted the ongoing debate about his replacement, André Onana, and provided a moment of closure for the celebrated Spanish goalkeeper and the club's fans.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Appointed by President Carter to lead the FBI in 1978, he was praised for restoring the agency's integrity after a period of scandal. President Reagan later tapped him to lead the CIA in 1987 to steady that agency following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his troubleshooting skills and unimpeachable honesty, Webster was a model public servant who prioritized the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is bringing renewed attention to Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who was more famous than Rembrandt in her own time but has since become a historical footnote. Specializing in "flower still life," Ruysch created intricate, vibrant compositions that were not just decorative but also scientifically detailed and morally complex. Despite facing the barriers of her era, she achieved immense success, becoming a court painter and creating works that masterfully elevated the genre.</p>
