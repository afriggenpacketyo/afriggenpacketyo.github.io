          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego has voiced his support for Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, amidst criticism from within the Democratic party and surprising defense from Republicans. Fetterman, who has faced scrutiny over his stances on Israel and his willingness to work with President Trump, is seen by Gallego as a valuable senator who fights for working-class people. While Gallego acknowledges disagreements with Fetterman, he warns that the GOP's support may be a tactic to push him further to the right. Gallego emphasized the importance of inclusivity within the Democratic party, stating that purity tests can lead to electoral losses.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, is promoting the health benefits of platonic touch through "cuddle puddles" and one-on-one therapy sessions. She believes that touch can boost serotonin and oxytocin levels while reducing cortisol, thus regulating the nervous system. While some may be skeptical, Wood emphasizes that her services are platonic and nurturing, with client safety ensured through screening and consent forms. Experts note that while touch can be beneficial, the relationship between individuals is crucial, and safety is paramount for positive outcomes, but cuddle therapy has been shown to relieve stress and promote relaxation.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by targeting lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense competition.

The company has expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets in China, while Luckin Coffee is also focusing on second and new first-tier cities. This trend reflects the growing consumer base in these regions, but it remains to be seen how much further Starbucks can expand beyond wealthier areas.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions rise, Chinese consumers are increasingly choosing domestic brands to express national pride and resilience. This shift reflects a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation and participate in shaping a modern national identity. Policy responses such as raising household incomes are important, but the emotional connection to consumer behavior is critical for China's economic growth. This trend is particularly strong among younger generations who view domestic brands as markers of cultural identity and ambition, underscoring a deeper transition towards a domestically driven consumption economy.</p>

While atmospheric rivers typically impact the Western U.S., a cutoff low is diverting this event eastward.
