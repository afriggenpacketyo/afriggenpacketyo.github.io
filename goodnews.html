          <p>Customs and Border Protection officers at the Los Angeles/Long Beach Seaport seized approximately 150,000 illegally imported cigarettes from a couple arriving from Ensenada, Mexico. The cigarettes, stored in 749 cartons across 10 pieces of luggage, were estimated to be worth nearly $60,000. The individuals were unable to produce permits for transporting such a large quantity of tobacco products, leading to the seizure and potential penalties for violating import laws. CBP officials emphasized their commitment to enforcing U.S. import laws and protecting the American public from schemes that evade revenue and potentially harm consumers.</p>

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this article explores the history of the Great Wall Film Company, one of the first Chinese American film studios in the U.S., founded in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Frustrated by demeaning portrayals of Chinese people in early Hollywood films, Harold Lee and Lee Kee Do established the studio to create more authentic representations. The studio later moved to Shanghai, producing about two dozen films, but eventually closed due to the Great Depression; however, the Lee family's impact continued with the New York Chinese Film Exchange, and their descendants remain active in the film industry today.</p>
