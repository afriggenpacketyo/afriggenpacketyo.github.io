          <h2>Appeals Court Sides with Trump Administration on California National Guard Control</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority when federalizing the California National Guard amidst immigration raid protests, indefinitely blocking a lower court order that would have returned control to Governor Newsom. The three-judge panel cited acts of violence during the protests as justification for Trump's decision, stating that protesters had engaged in violent acts against federal officers and damaged federal buildings. The court determined that the law invoked by Trump does not require the governor's consent, effectively allowing the Trump administration to maintain control of the guard as the case proceeds through the courts. This ruling puts a hold on a previous order by a lower court judge who deemed Trump's action illegal. </p>

Richards' goal came from a free kick by Sebastian Berhalter, clinching a knockout berth for the US, who have a strong record in group play. Coach Mauricio Pochettino maintained the same lineup from their previous win, but the match against Saudi Arabia saw fewer scoring opportunities for the Americans. The Gold Cup serves as a crucial competitive test for the US ahead of the 2026 World Cup, for which they are automatic qualifiers as co-hosts. </p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged following recent monetary easing measures and a trade deal with the U.S., easing some growth concerns. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, and the 5-year LPR is at 3.5%, aligning with Reuters poll estimates. This decision comes after authorities cut lending rates last month for the first time since October, aiming to mitigate the impact of trade tensions. A trade truce between the U.S. and China has provided some economic breathing room, allowing Beijing to support its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the Trump administration can maintain control of National Guard troops in Los Angeles while California's legal challenge proceeds. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, although this power is not "unreviewable." Legal scholars noted that the decision was expected, particularly given the shift in the 9th Circuit's ideological balance. The ruling largely avoids the question of whether the situation in Los Angeles constitutes a "rebellion," focusing instead on the limits of presidential power. </p>
