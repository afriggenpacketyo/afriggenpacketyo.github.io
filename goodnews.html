        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of some Japanese seafood, partially lifting a ban that was implemented in response to the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The measure, effective immediately, allows for the import of aquatic products from most of Japan but maintains the suspension for ten prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. Beijing had first suspended food imports from these areas in July 2023 before expanding it to a full ban on all Japanese seafood a month later, citing safety concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before the first payments were due. The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada over the tax, which would have applied a 3% levy retroactively. Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade agreement and would support a resumption of negotiations. The tax had been a point of contention, with the U.S. arguing it unfairly discriminated against American firms.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, U.S. Women's National Team coach Emma Hayes reflects on her transition to American soccer and her coaching philosophy. She emphasizes the importance of empathy, a clear vision, and vulnerability for great leadership, and notes the cultural differences in the approach to women's sports in the US. Hayes also discusses the need to improve infrastructure in rural communities and the evolving competitiveness of the NWSL. When asked about potentially managing the England national team in the future, she stated she would "never say never."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, reducing a punitive 25% tariff on British cars to 10% and allowing shipments to resume. Automakers like Aston Martin had paused exports, creating pent-up demand in the American market. The deal, however, has drawn criticism from the agricultural sector, with the National Farmers‚Äô Union arguing that farming interests, such as concessions on American ethanol imports, were sacrificed to protect the car industry. The agreement also includes provisions for steel, though negotiations on specifics are ongoing.</p>

          <p>As he approaches his 90th birthday, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, continues to be a prominent global figure advocating for Tibetan autonomy and religious freedom. Since fleeing into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, he has championed a non-violent "Middle Way" approach. His upcoming birthday is significant as he has indicated he may provide more details about his succession, stating his successor would be born in the "free world" outside of China. Despite health challenges, he remains active and influential from his home in Dharamshala.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce Motion Sickness</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the low-frequency deceleration from regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power when slowing down, can create sensations that provoke motion sickness symptoms. Researchers are exploring solutions to mitigate this uncomfortable side effect of the new technology.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has expressed concern that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could potentially "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to fixture congestion. While acknowledging the arguments against the tournament's demanding schedule, Guardiola stated that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by governing bodies like FIFA and the Premier League. He noted that many teams would love the opportunity to participate for the income and prestige, but conceded that the situation is not ideal for ensuring players get adequate rest.</p>
