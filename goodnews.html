          <p>The NHS in Scotland is considering establishing ketamine clinics to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. A psychiatrist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year, providing patients with an additional treatment option.</p>

Analysts suggest that the market sees the attack on Iran as a relief, diminishing the nuclear threat in the region.

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing Europe's defense spending, a long-standing demand of U.S. President Donald Trump. With most members committing to a significant increase in defense spending, the agreement is seen as a way to give Trump a win and rebalance the alliance. However, challenges remain, including securing unanimous support for the 3.5% target for core military spending and addressing concerns about Ukraine's NATO aspirations. The summit's success hinges on its ability to appease Trump while also addressing critical security concerns.</p>
