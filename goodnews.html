          <p>Garment manufacturers in China and Vietnam are cautiously optimistic after US President Donald Trump indicated that the United States is not focused on manufacturing sneakers and T-shirts. Despite this, businesses are proceeding with their plans to diversify markets due to the uncertainty surrounding US tariff policies. Both countries are currently in a 90-day pause in US tariffs and are attempting to negotiate a deal with Washington to prevent further duty increases. Recent comments from US officials suggest that Trump‚Äôs push to revive American manufacturing will not extend to low-margin sectors.</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore to Singapore as a safe haven amid growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A storage facility called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with relative political and economic stability, attracting high-net-worth clients seeking to mitigate risks related to tariffs and geopolitical instability. The wealthy are also opting for physical gold bars over paper gold to reduce counterparty and geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>Tom Hartley, a 26-year-old spinner, is in contention to return to the England cricket team for the one-day international series against the West Indies, despite balancing his cricket career with work at his family's garden center. Hartley's Nurseries, a sixth-generation family business, requires him to wake up early, water plants, and supervise staff before his cricket commitments. Hartley believes that having something to focus on outside of cricket helps him manage the pressure and provides perspective, so a bad game or season doesn't feel like the end of the world.</p>

          <p>Twenty companies have applied to purchase a combined 110,000 tons of the Japanese government's stockpiled rice, following the farm minister's announcement of direct sales contracts to curb soaring prices. This amount accounts for over 30 percent of the 300,000 tons planned for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system used earlier in the year. The average price of rice at supermarkets has doubled from the previous year, prompting the government to proactively intervene in the market. Contracts with some companies are expected to be finalized soon, with deliveries potentially starting this week.</p>

          <p>In a significant challenge to Darwinian evolution, Chinese scientists have revived the theory that acquired traits can shape heredity without DNA changes. A study published in Cell demonstrated that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures across five generations, bypassing genetic mutations. This research reignites the debate between Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics and Darwin's ideas about random genetic variation. The team found heritable DNA methylation changes as the driver of cold adaptation in crops, positioning Lamarckism as a force in evolution.</p>
