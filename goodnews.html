          <h2>Understanding the Hidden Costs of Collection Debt and Strategies for Mitigation</h2>

          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked costs associated with collection debt, which extend beyond the initial balance to include accruing interest, collection agency fees, potential legal costs, and long-term damage to credit scores. The piece emphasizes that unpaid collection debt can rapidly escalate due to these added expenses, making it increasingly difficult to manage over time. It advises individuals to negotiate settlements directly with collection agencies, request fee waivers, seek professional debt relief assistance, and consider available legal options, such as expired statutes of limitations, to reduce the overall financial burden. It is important to take proactive steps to rebuild financial health and address collection debt promptly, as the costs continue to accumulate the longer one waits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the Trump administration's attempts to minimize the focus on the nation's racial past, particularly in cultural institutions dedicated to Black history. The article highlights the initial rescinding and subsequent restoration of federal grants to the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana, a site focused on portraying the realities of slavery. Ashley Rogers, the plantation's executive director, criticized the administration's use of the phrase "improper ideology" as Orwellian, emphasizing the importance of presenting historical facts accurately. The article also notes the ongoing debate surrounding the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, reflecting broader tensions over how American history is interpreted and presented. This is taking place as the country is still reckoning with the effects of the murder of George Floyd.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people of the Peruvian Andes engaged in exclusive rituals involving psychoactive drugs. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which contained traces of DMT, a powerful hallucinogenic substance, and tobacco plants. The study indicates that these rituals, likely restricted to elite members of Chav√≠n society, may have played a role in establishing social and political hierarchies. The findings provide material evidence supporting the theory that hallucinogens were central to the ritual practices of this ancient civilization, considered a predecessor to the Inca civilization.</p>
