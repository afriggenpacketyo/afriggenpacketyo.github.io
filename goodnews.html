        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A heated scuffle broke out at a Tennessee Titans practice between rookie quarterback Cam Ward and veteran defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons. The confrontation began after Ward threw a touchdown pass and then mocked Simmons by performing the defensive tackle's signature "Zombieland" celebration in front of him. Simmons reacted by shoving Ward in the facemask, prompting the offensive line to intervene and protect their quarterback. Head coach Brian Callahan addressed the incident by making the entire team run after practice, emphasizing that while competitive spirit is encouraged, physical altercations involving the quarterback are unacceptable.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit led by Santa Clara County, California. The lawsuit alleged that the company used deceptive practices by enrolling customers in automatically renewing subscriptions without clear disclosure and making the cancellation process difficult. While HelloFresh denied any wrongdoing, it will pay millions in civil penalties and restitution to affected California consumers. The case was part of a broader effort by the state's 'Automatic Renewal Task Force' to combat misleading subscription models and false advertising practices by businesses.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump announced he has initiated arrangements for a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. In a social media post, Trump stated that after this bilateral meeting, he would join both leaders for trilateral talks, calling it a significant first step toward resolving the nearly four-year-long war. The Kremlin confirmed a call took place but its official statement only mentioned support for continued negotiations between delegations, without confirming a presidential-level meeting. This development comes after previous attempts to bring the two leaders together have been unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>An analysis from TIME suggests that European leaders successfully used a coordinated 'charm offensive' to guide President Trump back toward a supportive stance on Ukraine during a recent White House meeting. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others praised Trump's ability to convene the summit, a tactic that appeared to work on the president, who is known to be susceptible to flattery. Unlike a previous tense encounter, this meeting was more harmonious, resulting in Trump reviving the idea of a trilateral summit with Russia and Ukraine. The article argues that this diplomatic approach, focused on ego management rather than geopolitical arguments, proved effective for the moment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 18:11:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill requiring mortgage lenders to pay homeowners at least 2% interest on insurance payouts held in escrow accounts following natural disasters. The legislation addresses a loophole where lenders could deposit insurance funds and keep the accrued interest while homeowners waited for the money to be released for rebuilding. Authored by Assemblymember John Harabedian, the bill aims to provide additional financial support to residents recovering from catastrophic events like wildfires. The measure, which applies to both new and existing escrow accounts, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature to become law.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1st this year. Originating from the labor movement of the late 19th century, the holiday now also marks the unofficial end of summer for many. Most major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours, and shoppers should check with local stores. In contrast, government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed in observance of the holiday, which was officially signed into law in 1894.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's plan to build a large new embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London is a significant act of 'brick and mortar' diplomacy. The author suggests the project symbolizes China's rising global status and its long-term commitment to London as a key international hub. This contrasts with what the article describes as the UK's short-term approach of selling off prime diplomatic properties for financial gain. The proposed embassy is presented not just as a planning issue but as a powerful statement of national ambition and a test of the complex UK-China relationship.</p>
