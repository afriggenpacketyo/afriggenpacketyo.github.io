          <p>Brazilian authorities arrested two suspects, identified as fans of Lady Gaga, who were allegedly planning an attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were reportedly planning to use improvised explosives, though no explosives were found during the operation. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and that they had worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert, feeling confident about the safety measures in place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is nearing the creation of an official city called Starbase at its South Texas rocket facility, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The move aims to support the company's growth and operations, including increased launch activity, but has drawn criticism over potential expansion of Musk's control over the area, including beach closures. Companion bills in the state Legislature propose shifting authority over beach closures from the county to the new town's mayor and city council, sparking concerns about public access and environmental impact. SpaceX officials state the city authority is needed to manage infrastructure and streamline launch operations, while critics argue for maintaining county oversight to represent broader community interests.</p>

          <h2>Expiration of Tariff Exemption Set to Increase Costs for Shoppers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 16:24:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is expected to raise prices on cheaper goods from China for U.S. consumers, impacting ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu. The loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, allowed these retailers to undercut U.S.-based sellers. The end of the exemption means that many goods will no longer be as low-priced, and importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection face the challenge of inspecting millions of additional packages daily, potentially causing shipment delays. The change, initiated by President Trump, aims to address concerns about fentanyl flow and level the playing field for U.S. businesses.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he transformed from a failing textile manufacturer. Buffett's value investing approach, characterized by buying wonderful businesses at fair prices, influenced generations of financiers and made him a legendary figure in American capitalism. His announcement was met with surprise and applause at Berkshire's annual meeting, where shareholders have become millionaires by following his financial wisdom. Buffett's successor, Gregory Abel, is expected to continue running the company, though some worry that Berkshire may lose its unique character without its chief architect.</p>

The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power.

          <p>A seafood restaurant on Cape Cod, Captain Scott‚Äôs Restaurant, was demolished after a significant fire tore through the building on Sunday morning. Firefighters responded to the scene and initially launched an interior attack, but the floor became unstable, forcing them to fight the fire from the exterior. One firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion, and the fire caused an estimated $1 million in damage, declaring the building a total loss. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but preliminary findings suggest an electrical issue.</p>
