          <p>Weston Halsne, a 10-year-old boy who survived the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, is scheduled for surgery to remove a bullet fragment discovered in his neck. The fragment is located dangerously close to his carotid artery. Halsne gained national attention for his harrowing account of the attack, where he credited a friend for saving his life by shielding him. The community has shown significant support, raising nearly $60,000 through an online fundraiser to assist with his medical expenses as he and other victims continue their recovery.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving member of the U.S. House from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. In an interview, the 78-year-old congressman cited the "necessity for generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary motivation for his decision. Nadler, who has served since 1992 and chaired the powerful House Judiciary Committee during Donald Trump's first impeachment, stated he believes a younger successor could better address the political challenges facing the nation. His announcement was met with praise from colleagues, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Hidden Mathematical Pattern in Earth's Geological History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 20:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has uncovered a surprising mathematical order within the planet's geological timeline, suggesting that major events like mass extinctions and evolutionary bursts are not random. Researchers found that the boundaries between geological periods in the Phanerozoic Eon follow a multifractal pattern, forming hierarchical clusters separated by long periods of stability. This discovery challenges the view of Earth's history as chaotic, indicating a deeply structured system. The findings imply that understanding the full range of Earth's potential changes, including future upheavals, requires analyzing geological records spanning at least half a billion years.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a disability affecting all four limbs, has spoken out about the significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. In an interview, she detailed everyday obstacles, from heavy doors with round handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets. While acknowledging that some improvements have been made, Tidball argues that the historic building remains largely inaccessible and does not reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. A parliamentary committee is currently reviewing these issues with a report expected later this year.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has confirmed that his vision is fine following a fireworks accident in July and that he expects to be ready for the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. Addressing reporters for the first time since the incident, Harris described the experience as humbling but stated the eye injury was superficial. After being cleared for contact, he has been increasing his workload in practice. Coach Jim Harbaugh noted that Harris has looked "really, really good" and that there is a strong possibility he will play, potentially continuing his streak of never missing an NFL game.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a landmark of American architecture and a cornerstone of the national park lodge style. Built in 1904, it was constructed using some 10,000 trees, including many uniquely twisted logs that architect Robert Reamer called the "freaks of the forest." This iconic log structure not only offers a historic lodging experience but also set the standard for grand lodges in other national parks like Yosemite and Glacier. For over a century, it has welcomed millions of visitors while enduring natural events, serving as a testament to its enduring design and craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell has shared a meaningful lesson he learned about the unpredictable impact of his art, involving fellow musicians Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell. Odell recalled a 2016 show he considered a failure, only to learn years later that it inspired Finneas to pursue his own solo career. This connection came full circle when Eilish invited Odell to open for her European tour, coinciding with a resurgence in his own career. Odell reflects on how this experience taught him that even on days when he feels he has nothing to offer, his work can still profoundly affect others.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with the total outlay for the summer transfer window surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The final figure was pushed past the milestone by several big-money deadline day deals, including Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move from Newcastle to Liverpool. This summer's spending significantly exceeds last year's £1.96 billion and is more than the combined total spent by the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, highlighting the Premier League's immense financial dominance in European football.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to at least 286,000 years old. This places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and provides crucial insights into human evolution in Europe. The dating, achieved through advanced uranium-series techniques, strengthens the theory that the skull belongs to Homo heidelbergensis or a related archaic human population. This suggests that these more primitive humans coexisted in southeastern Europe alongside the emerging Neanderthal lineage, painting a more complex and branched picture of our evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>The aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, may be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days, according to the Met Office. A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun has heightened solar activity, creating a "decent chance" for the phenomenon to be seen much farther south than usual. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, forecasters suggest that Monday and Tuesday nights offer the best opportunity for a rare and memorable display. The Midlands may have the clearest skies, providing a prime viewing location.</p>
