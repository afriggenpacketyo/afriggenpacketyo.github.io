          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Steady Interest Rates Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 15:01:20 EDT</div>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its key interest rate steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, acknowledging increased uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly concerning the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. The central bank's statement highlighted rising risks of both higher unemployment and inflation, creating a potential stagflationary environment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is currently in solid shape, allowing the Fed to remain patient and monitor the effects of tariffs and trade negotiations. The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach as it navigates conflicting economic signals and pressures from the White House.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, experienced a significant jump in April, reaching its highest level since October 2023. This increase of 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% month-over-month reflects a rush of consumer purchases driven by concerns over potential price hikes resulting from auto tariffs. Cox Automotive analysts noted that the typical spring bounce in used vehicle prices extended throughout April, indicating a stronger-than-usual appreciation.

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners are considering HELOCs, but it's crucial to understand the product. This article outlines three key points for borrowers considering a $100,000 HELOC: it's currently the cheapest way to borrow home equity compared to other options, rates are likely to decrease further in the coming months, and borrowers must factor in potential rate volatility when calculating repayments. The piece emphasizes the need for caution and strategic planning when using home equity as a funding source.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady has prompted questions about the future of mortgage rates. The article explains that mortgage rates are not directly set by the Fed but are influenced by broader economic factors, including inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty. While the Fed's pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, it's only one piece of the puzzle. The article provides advice on how to find the lowest mortgage rates, including improving credit score, shopping around, considering a rate buydown, exploring loan types, and locking rates strategically.</p>

The article compares home equity loans, which offer fixed rates, to HELOCs, which have variable rates.
