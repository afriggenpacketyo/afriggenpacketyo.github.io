          <p>Pete Alonso has become the all-time home run leader for the New York Mets, hitting his 253rd career homer in a game against the Atlanta Braves. The record-breaking two-run blast surpassed the previous franchise high held by Darryl Strawberry. This achievement comes after Alonso, a fan favorite, secured his future with the team by signing a two-year, $54 million contract in the offseason. The milestone highlights a successful season for Alonso, who continues to be a key player as the Mets compete for a playoff spot.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has submitted an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. This move comes after a U.S. court ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in the search market, with the Department of Justice suggesting that divesting Chrome would remedy the issue. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal. The bid represents a significant strategic maneuver in the competitive AI landscape, where companies are vying for market dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% support among registered voters, compared to 25% for Cuomo and 7% for incumbent Eric Adams, both of whom are running as independents. Mamdani's support is particularly strong among younger voters, though he trails Cuomo with Black and Jewish voters. The results signal a potential political shift, though leading centrist Democrats have not yet endorsed Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillator use to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the millions of new drivers each year with basic life-saving knowledge, as they are often the first to arrive at accident scenes. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use public access defibrillators. Officials hope this change could help prevent avoidable deaths by increasing public emergency response skills.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey is now able to learn directly from veteran Keenan Allen, who recently returned to the team. Before Allen's return, McConkey had been studying his practice film, and now the two are working closely together on the field. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman noted that Allen's presence adds flexibility and strength to the offense. The collaboration between the promising rookie and the seasoned Pro Bowler is seen as a significant positive development for the team's offense as they prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, ending a weeklong boil water notice. The advisory was issued after a faulty, 57-year-old underground valve caused a service outage for about 9,200 households. After repairing the complex issue, the DWP confirmed the water meets safety standards and is now urging residents to flush their pipes and appliances before consumption. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially admitted that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during its fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to Cameroonian President Paul Biya, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for actions that cost tens of thousands of lives. This acknowledgement follows a 2022 report commissioned by France which detailed mass displacement and support for brutal militias by French colonial troops, even after Cameroon's independence in 1960. The move is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial legacy in Africa.</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described as "key operatives" of major drug cartels, to the United States to face charges for violent offenses and organized crime. This is the second major transfer of its kind this year, conducted as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to combat drug trafficking. The extradited individuals, who were not publicly named, allegedly include members of the powerful Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels.

          <p>Art Fein, a multifaceted champion of the Los Angeles music scene, has passed away at the age of 79 from heart failure. Over a six-decade career, Fein worked as a journalist, publicist, manager, and the host of the long-running public access TV show "Lil Art's Poker Party." He was instrumental in nurturing the city's early punk and rockabilly scenes, helping to launch the careers of bands like the Cramps and the Blasters. Remembered as a passionate advocate for music rather than a critic, Fein left an indelible mark on the culture of his adopted city.</p>

          <p>A report by the UK's Transport Committee has recommended piloting a free bus pass scheme for everyone under 22 in England to improve access to jobs and education. The MPs found that declining bus services and rising fares, which have outpaced inflation, create significant barriers for young people, especially in rural areas. A similar program has been in effect in Scotland since 2022. The report argues that reliable and affordable public transport is crucial for economic growth and reducing social exclusion for both young and elderly populations.</p>

          <h2>Rolls-Royce CEO Claims AI-Focused Nuclear Power Strategy Could Make It UK's Top Firm</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce has stated that the company's plan to power AI data centers with its small modular reactors (SMRs) could make it the UK's most valuable company. The engineering firm has already signed deals to provide its land-based nuclear technology to meet the immense energy demands of artificial intelligence. This strategy positions Rolls-Royce to dominate a potential trillion-dollar market for SMRs, leveraging its existing nuclear expertise from building submarine reactors. The move reflects a bold pivot for the company, which has seen its share price increase tenfold since 2023. (not investment advice)</p>
