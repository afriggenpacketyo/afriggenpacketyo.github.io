          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 07:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airbus has overtaken Boeing as the world's largest planemaker, driven by Boeing's recent struggles with technical failures and production issues. The Air India Flight 171 crash, which resulted in numerous fatalities, further underscores concerns about operational safety. Boeing reported a significant operating loss in 2024, delivering fewer commercial airplanes than Airbus, while Airbus posted a substantial operating profit. The contrast in handling their largest aircraft, the A380 and 787 Dreamliner, respectively, highlights the different approaches and outcomes for each company. The rivalry between Airbus and Boeing extends to government subsidies and competition in the space and defense sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to release male mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria to combat avian malaria, which threatens native honeycreepers. These lab-reared male mosquitoes don't bite and, when they mate with wild females, their eggs do not hatch, reducing the overall mosquito population. The warming climate allows mosquitoes to climb to higher elevations where the last remaining honeycreepers live, and this is a race against time to save these endangered birds. This approach has been successful in other parts of the world to combat human diseases.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president "total control" over the company. This regulatory approval clears the final hurdle for the transaction, which remains subject to customary closing conditions. The golden share typically allows the holder veto power over significant company decisions. The transaction is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Boston Red Sox have traded All-Star slugger Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants, sending Jordan Hicks, Kyle Harrison, James Tibbs III, and Jose Bello to Boston.

The Giants hope Devers's power bat will boost their lineup, which has struggled to produce home runs from the left side. The Red Sox are looking to rebuild their roster with young talent.</p>

          <p>Miami Heat star Tyler Herro made controversial statements during a recent livestream, questioning the validity of historical events prior to 1950. When asked about Wilt Chamberlain's potential in today's NBA, Herro expressed ignorance, then questioned the reality of history itself. He stated he doesn't believe in events before 1950, including the moon landing and Christopher Columbus's voyages. It remains unclear whether Herro's remarks were serious or made in jest during the casual livestream setting.</p>

Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Brazil are seen as potential beneficiaries due to lower labor costs and strong trade ties with Western markets. Washington's "friendshoring" and the "China+1" strategy are driving multinational companies to diversify production. Chinese firms are also exploring lower-cost regions, particularly among Belt and Road Initiative partners. These trends could lead to significant shifts in global production and trade.</p>

          <p>California is employing intentional, prescribed burns to mitigate the risk of devastating wildfires. These controlled burns, often conducted in remote areas, reduce the amount of dry brush and vegetation that can fuel large-scale fires. However, federal budget cuts to agencies like the U.S. Forest Service threaten these efforts by reducing staffing for essential logistical and regulatory roles. Despite these challenges, California is increasing its forest management budget to help bridge the gap and protect communities from the increasing threat of wildfires.</p>

While assisted stretching may increase range of motion and stimulate blood flow, consistency is key to long-term benefits, and it's not a cure-all. Potential risks exist for individuals with existing injuries or hypermobility syndromes, highlighting the importance of consulting with a doctor before trying it.</p>
