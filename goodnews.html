          <p>Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, comfortably beating the defending champion. Despite falling short of his 2021 world record of 76, Chestnut expressed his excitement to be back and vowed to return next year. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs, continuing her long-standing dominance in the event.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating its readiness to enter negotiations. The proposed deal, announced by President Trump, involves a potential two-month ceasefire, though Israel has not yet publicly confirmed its formal agreement. A Palestinian official indicated that Hamas is seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the truce. The ongoing conflict, which began after the October 7th attack, has resulted in a significant number of casualties in Gaza.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of Wimbledon in the third round following a hard-fought match against top seed Aryna Sabalenka. Raducanu challenged the three-time Grand Slam champion, pushing the first set to a tie-break before ultimately losing 7-6, 6-4. Despite taking an early lead in the second set, Raducanu could not maintain the momentum against the powerful Belarusian. Sabalenka acknowledged the tough competition, stating she had to fight for every point to secure her place in the fourth round.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new spending bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, despite claims suggesting it does. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but is far from a full repeal of the tax, and it does not change the fundamental taxation of Social Security payments. The deduction, which expires in 2028, will primarily benefit higher-income seniors and will not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is displaying renewed optimism after a prolonged downturn, highlighted by the successful public debut of crypto company Circle. The firm's stock has surged sixfold since its June offering, boosting confidence among venture capitalists who have been awaiting a market recovery. After a record-breaking 2021, tech IPOs slowed dramatically due to rising interest rates and inflation, creating a "backlog of liquidity drought" for investors. While the market is not fully recovered, the recent increase in public offerings and strong performances from companies like Circle and CoreWeave suggest a potential end to the drought.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's newly passed spending bill will create a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, effectively eliminating their federal income tax liability on tips. The White House has promoted this as a major benefit for the working class, estimating it will increase average take-home pay by over $1,600 annually. However, critics note the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and will not benefit the lowest-wage workers who earn too little to have a federal tax liability. The specifics of the deduction cap vary between the House and Senate versions of the bill. (not investment advice)</p>
