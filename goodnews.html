          <p>Antonio McDowell, after serving 28 years, has been fully exonerated following a judge's decision to overturn his wrongful conviction. McDowell was framed for murder by retired Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions in numerous cases. McDowell, who was initially a shooting victim, was framed after he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, who has never been charged with misconduct. The Exoneration Project and Loevy and Loevy represented and supported McDowell for years, leading to the dismissal of both his murder and carjacking convictions.</p>

          <p>Smoke from Canadian wildfires has spread across the Upper Midwest, prompting air quality alerts in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and parts of Nebraska and Michigan. These alerts advise vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, children, and individuals with respiratory issues, to remain indoors or limit outdoor activities to minimize exposure to the harmful pollutants in the air. The smoke is expected to persist for several days, impacting visibility and potentially causing respiratory problems for residents in the affected areas, with officials monitoring the situation closely and providing updates as conditions evolve. The situation underscores the far-reaching impacts of wildfires and the importance of heeding air quality warnings to protect public health. The air quality is expected to improve over the next few days as the weather patterns change. </p>

          <p>The White House is defending FEMA's preparedness for hurricane season, dismissing reports that the agency's acting administrator was unaware of the annual period. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the media's "sloppy and irresponsible" reporting, attributing the claims to jokes and leaked information. Despite the controversy, she emphasized that FEMA is taking the hurricane season seriously and that the President is committed to providing federal resources to states in need. Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have criticized the administrator's alleged remarks, raising concerns about his qualifications to lead FEMA.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which disrupted the typical seasonal pattern last year. The previous year's norovirus season started earlier than usual, driven by the GII.17 strain, raising concerns about whether this pattern could repeat. Researchers are uncertain if GII.17 will remain the dominant strain or if the traditional GII.4 strain will regain prevalence. Shifts in norovirus strains occur when new variants evade existing immunity, potentially leading to more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.</p>

          <p>Police in Clearwater, Florida, have identified the body of Edman Eric Gleed, who was found floating near a bridge in 1993, using advanced DNA testing. Gleed had been listed as missing from Fairfax County, Virginia, by his son at the time of his death. The identification was made possible through investigative genetic genealogy, which matched Gleed's DNA to potential family members. The technique uncovered connections to an 18th-century couple from Bristol, England, leading to the verification of Gleed's identity with a comparison sample from his son.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates while they challenge an executive order restricting access to such treatments. The judge granted a preliminary injunction sought by three transgender inmates, finding they are likely to succeed on their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The ruling blocks administration officials from enforcing the executive order as it relates to hormone therapy and social accommodations for transgender inmates. The judge criticized the administration for failing to provide a "serious explanation" as to why medical treatment for gender dysphoria should be handled differently than other mental health interventions.</p>
