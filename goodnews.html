          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission, a move Prime Minister Starmer calls an investment in national security amidst global uncertainty. These jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, supporting 20,000 jobs and 100 businesses across the country. While the US controls the release and use of pre-positioned B61 bombs in Europe, the UK maintains its independent nuclear deterrent via Trident ballistic missiles launched from Vanguard class submarines. The new jets will offer longer range and a wider range of conventional weapons, marking a significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture. The UK retired its tactical nuclear weapons in 1998 and this purchase signals a return to the nuclear game.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release documents detailing the activities of the military in Southern California, granting a procedural victory to California in its efforts to oversee the thousands of troops under the president's command. Judge Breyer authorized California lawyers to depose key administration officials, including those from ICE and the Army, and signaled he might review questions about how long troops remain under federal control. The ruling follows a previous appellate court decision that broadly deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard. California's lawyers are arguing that by aiding immigration raids, troops under Trump‚Äôs command violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids soldiers from enforcing civilian laws.</p>

However, Anthropic will face a separate trial in December regarding the downloading of millions of pirated books, an issue that caused internal concern among employees.
