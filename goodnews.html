        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 experienced a slight downturn this week, ending a four-week winning streak, yet it successfully closed out August with a monthly gain of over 2%. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the weekly decline. Despite some investor concerns about Nvidia's data center revenue, its overall performance has been a major market driver. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at 2.9%, keeping the possibility of a September interest rate cut on the table.

          <p>Meta announced it is implementing temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenagers in response to a Senate investigation and public criticism. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent inappropriate romantic conversations, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move follows reports that internal documents permitted chatbots to have "romantic" conversations with minors, which Meta now calls erroneous. Advocacy group Common Sense Media recently issued a risk assessment advising against teen use of Meta AI until fundamental safety issues are addressed.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but has changed its guidance on eligibility. Previously available to almost everyone six months and older, the updated shots are now officially limited to individuals at higher risk of serious complications, specifically those aged 65 or older or people with underlying health problems. This policy shift marks a departure from the broader vaccination campaigns seen earlier in the pandemic. The change has raised questions among the public regarding access and the evolving strategy for managing COVID-19 as the virus continues to circulate.</p>

Democrats are defending 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, creating a challenging map for Democrats aiming to win a majority. High-profile races are anticipated in states like North Carolina, where an open seat is expected to draw massive spending, and Georgia, where incumbent Jon Ossoff faces a tough reelection battle. Other notable states with competitive races include Michigan, New Hampshire, and Texas, where an intense Republican primary is unfolding.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares climbed nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its first fiscal quarter, largely driven by strong performance in its cloud computing unit. Revenue from the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, the accelerated growth in the high-margin cloud business and improvements in e-commerce have bolstered investor confidence. The company continues to invest heavily in AI and instant commerce to compete in China's challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. The homeowner, backed by consumer advocacy groups, argues that any rate changes should be tied to the quality of service customers receive.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted an offer from Spanish club Real Betis for the transfer of Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old, who joined United from Ajax for £81.3 million in 2022, had a disappointing tenure at the club but found success during a loan spell with Betis last season. As one of the most expensive signings in Manchester United's history, his departure marks the end of a challenging period for the player in England.

          <p>Paleontologists have identified a new species of ankylosaur, an armored herbivorous dinosaur, based on recently discovered fossils in Morocco. Named Spicomellus, the 165-million-year-old dinosaur is the oldest known ankylosaur and has been described as one of the strangest ever found due to its unique defensive features. Unlike any other known vertebrate, Spicomellus had long, bony spikes fused directly to its rib bones, creating a formidable armory. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, suggesting their defensive armor was complex much earlier than previously believed.</p>

The election was the town's first since the 1960s, held as part of a federal settlement after Braxton sued over the town's history of "hand-me-down governance," where mayors appointed their successors. In 2020, Braxton ran unopposed but was prevented from serving for three years. His decisive victory this week is seen as a significant step toward restoring democratic representation in the majority-Black town.</p>

A 2023 FAA rule mandates these barriers on all new commercial passenger aircraft, and both Boeing and Airbus have started delivering planes with the feature installed. While the FAA has granted airlines an extension until 2026 to implement the barriers, Southwest has chosen to comply immediately upon receiving new aircraft.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has scheduled a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months, a delay that has drawn criticism from Republicans. The vacancy in the 35th Senate District was created when the Democratic incumbent was elected to the U.S. House. Democrats currently hold a narrow 19-18 majority in the chamber, and a Republican victory in the special election could create a tie, potentially allowing the GOP to block parts of Whitmer's legislative agenda. The primary will be held in February 2026, with the general election in May.</p>
