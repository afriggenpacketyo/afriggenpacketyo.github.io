Another claim alleged that photos of National Guard personnel sleeping on the ground were taken in Afghanistan in 2021, which was debunked by the San Francisco Chronicle.

          <p>Researchers have analyzed gold coins recovered from the San Jose galleon, a Spanish ship that sank off the coast of Colombia in 1708 while laden with treasure. The coins, featuring depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, confirm their origin from the San Jose. Analysis of high-resolution images shows the coins have an average diameter of 32.5 millimeters and weigh approximately 27 grams, with some bearing the Latin motto "Plus Ultra." The Colombian government plans to begin extractions from the shipwreck, which has been declared a protected archeological area.</p>

          <p>Entering romantic relationships can often lead to a decline in friendships, as society prioritizes romantic bonds over platonic ones. This hierarchy of connection can result in friends feeling neglected or replaced, particularly when couples retreat into coupledom. Historically, friendships held a more significant role, with deep connections and emotional support often found in platonic relationships. To maintain friendships, it's important to prioritize both love and friendship, making time for friends and recognizing their individual roles in your life. Jealousy can be a signal to value and be intentional about maintaining those relationships.</p>

          <p>Disney and Universal have jointly filed a lawsuit against AI image creator Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement. The lawsuit claims that Midjourney used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies and alleges that Midjourney disregarded requests to stop. The studios included numerous examples in the suit of AI-generated images of characters from Cars, Toy Story, Shrek, The Avengers and the minions from Despicable Me. The companies are demanding a jury trial, arguing that the actions threaten to "upend the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law."</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will remain unchanged, even as a trade deal between Washington and Beijing has yet to be finalized. Lutnick clarified that President Trump's statement about 55% duties comprises existing tariffs. This announcement follows high-level trade talks in London, where a tentative de-escalation on tariffs was reached but key sticking points remained unclear. The confirmation of stable tariff levels aims to provide clarity amid ongoing trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to new estimates from The Senior Citizens League and Mary Johnson. This projection is based on the latest government inflation data and is slightly higher than previous forecasts. The COLA aims to ensure that monthly Social Security checks keep pace with inflation, with the official announcement typically made in October. The actual COLA could change based on future inflation data and the impact of President Trump's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has echoed President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve, stating that the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates is "monetary malpractice." Vance's statement follows a report showing that tariffs have not exerted substantial upward pressure on inflation. Both Trump and Vance are urging the Fed to ease monetary policy, despite concerns about the longer-term impacts of tariffs on prices. The FOMC is expected to release its interest rate decision next week, with markets assigning zero probability of a rate cut.</p>
