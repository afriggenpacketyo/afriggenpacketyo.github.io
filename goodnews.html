          <p>Stock market futures experienced a surge following a federal court's decision to halt most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump had exceeded his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy, blocking duties on China, Mexico, and Canada. Overseas markets also responded positively to the news, with gains seen in Germany, France, and Japan. Analysts suggest that if the Trump administration loses its appeal, it could reduce downside risks to the economy and upside risks to inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>United Airlines is set to re-establish its presence at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways. This collaboration, named Blue Sky, will enable the airlines to sell seats on each other's platforms, allowing JetBlue customers to accrue frequent flyer miles on United flights and vice versa. The partnership also encompasses reciprocal loyalty benefits, including priority boarding for elite status holders, with some aspects of the deal anticipated to commence as early as the fall. United's CEO, Scott Kirby, noted that this partnership will create the largest presence in Boston and extend United's reach in Florida and the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Trump on numerous countries, deeming them beyond presidential authority. The ruling is a potentially serious blow to Trump's economic agenda and ongoing trade deal efforts. Dow futures jumped on the news, but the Trump administration has appealed the decision. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports, and specific tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking were also deemed invalid.</p>

          <p>England could face drinking water shortages within a decade unless new reservoirs are built, according to a government minister. The government is speeding up the planning process for two reservoir projects to address this potential crisis. The Environment Secretary will make the final decisions about the proposed Fens Reservoir in Cambridgeshire and the Lincolnshire Reservoir. Scientists warn that household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population, as these reservoirs are not expected to be completed until 2036 and 2040 respectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the idea of communal kid discipline, contrasting it with the highly individualistic approach common in America. The author recounts an experience in Prague where a stranger corrected her child's behavior, leading her to question American norms. Historically, child-rearing was more of a collective endeavor, with neighbors and strangers feeling empowered to correct children. The author argues that a more communal approach could benefit both parents and children, but acknowledges the challenges of reviving such norms in modern society.</p>
