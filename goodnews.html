          <p>Microsoft has avoided a significant European Union antitrust fine by agreeing to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its Office software suites. The European Commission accepted legally binding commitments from the tech giant, which include offering versions of its software without Teams at a reduced price for at least seven years. This decision follows a 2023 investigation prompted by a complaint from rival Slack, owned by Salesforce, which argued Microsoft's bundling practices were anti-competitive and harmed consumer choice.</p>

          <p>On the 48th anniversary of his death, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority announced it will reopen the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko died in police custody in 1977 at age 30, with authorities at the time claiming it was due to a hunger strike, a narrative long disputed by his family. His death from a brain hemorrhage, believed to be the result of torture, became a global symbol of the brutality of the apartheid regime. No one has ever been held accountable for his death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation, many seniors are exploring ways to tap into their substantial home equity without taking on additional monthly debt. One primary option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners 62 and older, which provides funds that are repaid only when the home is sold or the owner moves out. Another method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation, without interest or monthly payments. These financial tools offer liquidity for retirees on fixed incomes (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are preparing to launch daily oral obesity drugs in the U.S. next year, shifting their competition from injectables to pills. While Lilly's injectable Zepbound is highly effective, its oral drug, orforglipron, showed less weight loss in trials than Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. Despite this, Lilly's chief scientific officer expressed confidence, highlighting that their pill is easier to manufacture and does not have the food and water restrictions associated with Novo's product. This new market is expected to significantly expand access to GLP-1 medications.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a new pilot program to accelerate the safe integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Key industry players Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are participating in the initiative, which will establish public-private partnerships to conduct supervised trials. The program follows a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at fostering eVTOL development in the U.S. Both companies praised the move as a critical step toward establishing commercial air taxi services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent works of fiction are offering raw and insightful depictions of what panic attacks feel like, moving beyond simple descriptions to capture their existential weight. Michael Clune's novel "Pan" explores a teenage boy's debilitating panic attacks by connecting them to the mythological origins of the word. Similarly, Lee Lai’s graphic novel "Cannon" uses the surreal imagery of menacing magpies to visualize the protagonist's growing anxiety as she navigates personal and professional stress. Both books aim to articulate the internal, often isolating, experience of extreme anxiety through creative narrative.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of Boeing, viewing the recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The stock fell after the CEO acknowledged delays in the 777X aircraft certification process. However, the club's analysis suggests this setback is temporary and does not alter the company's long-term cash flow trajectory or its improving financial and cultural situation under new leadership. They are capitalizing on the short-term dip to build their new position in the aerospace company (not investment advice).</p>

The French and Saudi-backed initiative, which passed 142-10, aims to lay the groundwork for a sovereign Palestinian state and comes ahead of a summit where France plans to formally recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>A new book by Harvard historian and New Yorker writer Jill Lepore, titled "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," examines the origins and evolution of America's founding document. An excerpt from the introduction frames the Constitution not as a static relic but as a living entity composed of ideas that endure and change over time. Lepore highlights the document's ingenious design, which accounted for the passage of time and the need for reform. The book explores the ongoing struggle to amend and interpret the Constitution for an evolving nation.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is creating a noticeable shift in the apparel market, dubbed the "Ozempic effect." Clothing resellers report a significant increase in donations of larger-sized clothing, while demand for smaller sizes is growing. In response, some retailers are reducing the in-store stock of extended sizes, making them more frequently available as online-only items. While the plus-size market remains significant, brands are observing a trend of customers moving from the largest sizes (5-6XL) into a lower tier of plus-sizes (3-4XL).</p>
