          <p>Jack Grealish is putting significant pressure on England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, for a spot in the national squad ahead of next summer's World Cup. Currently on loan at Everton, Grealish scored a dramatic 93rd-minute winner against Crystal Palace, continuing a run of excellent form that includes four assists in his first six league appearances. Despite being left out of the latest squad, his performances have drawn praise from figures like former England striker Wayne Rooney, who believes Grealish's talent will give the national team manager a selection "headache."</p>

          <p>Hosting the season premiere of 'Saturday Night Live,' musical artist Bad Bunny used his opening monologue to push back against conservative criticism of his upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. He specifically referenced threats from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who warned that immigration agents would be present at the event. The Puerto Rican singer, who is a U.S. citizen, spoke in both English and Spanish, emphasizing the cultural contributions of Latinos to the United States and humorously suggesting that those who didn't understand his Spanish had four months to learn before the Super Bowl.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is closely monitoring the U.S. government shutdown, which so far has not dampened market performance, largely due to strong interest in artificial intelligence stocks. However, prolonged political gridlock could pose a risk to the economy and corporate earnings. With official economic data delayed, investors will be looking to upcoming corporate reports from companies like PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines for crucial insights into consumer health and economic trends. Another key event is the investor day for Solstice Advanced Materials, which is set to be spun off from Honeywell. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research and clinical experience, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. A subtle shift, such as a sigh or a sharp edge, can make a neutral question feel like an accusation, escalating tensions. Since nonverbal cues carry significant emotional weight, partners often remember how something was said more than the words themselves. To de-escalate, experts recommend catching and correcting one's own harsh tone or calmly asking a partner to rephrase their statement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025 alone, indicating a significant influx of investment, particularly into leagues in England and the United States. While this growth reflects the sport's rising popularity and commercial viability, it also raises concerns about a widening financial gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete with the broadcast and sponsorship revenues of their English and American counterparts, potentially creating a permanent tier of super-clubs that dominate the sport.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests HPV Herd Immunity is Attainable in the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, due to a successful and long-running vaccination program for adolescents. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that high, gender-neutral vaccination rates have led to a dramatic decline in HPV infections, even among unvaccinated women. While experts celebrate this as a major public health achievement, they caution that maintaining this community protection is dependent on sustaining high vaccine uptake and combating misinformation.</p>

          <p>A series of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near the Big Bear area in Southern California over the weekend. The cluster of temblors was centered in the San Bernardino Mountains and produced weak shaking that was felt by some residents indoors. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that the event was minor and caused no damage. The area's last major seismic activity was in 1992, when a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck, following the powerful magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake on the same day.</p>

Piastri voiced his frustration over the team radio, claiming it was unfair that Norris was not asked to reverse positions. The incident adds to a series of contentious situations between the two drivers as they battle for the championship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author and researcher Brené Brown argues that effective communication requires a tolerance for discomfort because honesty and vulnerability are inherently difficult. In a recent interview, she explained that people often struggle to communicate well because they are not taught how to be clear, use precise language, or take accountability when conflicts arise. To navigate difficult conversations, experts suggest using phrases that validate the other person's feelings and demonstrate active listening, such as "It sounds like what's most important to you is..." to show you understand their perspective before responding.</p>

          <p>Major corporations including Prologis, Amazon, and Meta have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon concrete. The initiative aims to use the members' collective purchasing power to create market demand for sustainable building materials, thereby encouraging investment in decarbonization technologies for cement production, which accounts for 8% of global emissions. By creating offtake agreements and using a "book-and-claim" system, the alliance hopes to overcome the high costs and logistical challenges that have slowed the transition to greener construction materials.</p>
