          <p>ESPN has entered into two major agreements, acquiring the NFL Network and securing exclusive U.S. rights for all WWE Premium Live Events starting in 2026. The deal with the NFL, which is still subject to final approvals, would also give ESPN distribution rights for the RedZone channel in exchange for a 10% equity stake for the league. These strategic moves were announced as parent company Disney reported strong third-quarter profits, driven by growth in its streaming services and theme parks.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 10:18:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As retirees face increasing financial pressure from rising living costs, experts are advising homeowners on leveraging their home equity. The article explores two primary options: selling the home to downsize or obtaining a reverse mortgage to access cash without monthly repayments. A reverse mortgage can supplement a fixed income but reduces the inheritance left to heirs and comes with its own fees and risks. The best choice depends on individual circumstances, such as the desire to remain in the home, local market conditions, and long-term financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares for the e-commerce platform Shopify soared by 20% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations. The company also provided an optimistic forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage range. Executives noted that a potential negative impact from U.S. trade tariffs had been factored into guidance but did not materialize, with consumer demand remaining strong. The positive results suggest Shopify is successfully navigating macroeconomic uncertainties while benefiting from investments in new AI-powered tools for its merchants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This feature article details a writer's personal journey to overcome her fear of flying by attending a free class taught by a former commercial pilot, "Captain Ron." The class combines practical information about aviation safety with cognitive strategies for managing anxiety and claustrophobia. The experience includes a session on a stationary Southwest Airlines plane, where participants learn about turbulence, airplane mechanics, and breathing techniques. While the class did not completely cure her phobia, the author found new tools for managing her fear and a sense of community with fellow anxious fliers, viewing it as a meaningful step in confronting her anxiety.</p>

          <p>McDonald's exceeded Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue, driven by a rebound in its U.S. same-store sales, which grew 2.5%. The company attributed the growth to successful promotions like the "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the return of Snack Wraps. However, executives expressed ongoing concern about the economic health of low-income consumers, noting that traffic from this demographic declined by double digits across the fast-food industry. The company is exploring ways to make its core menu more affordable to re-engage this critical customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

The company said it shares President Trump's goal of lowering drug prices but believes more discussion is needed on the right policy format.

          <p>Disney reported third-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations on earnings, though revenue fell slightly short. The strong performance was driven by continued growth in its direct-to-consumer streaming business and increased consumer spending at its theme parks, which helped offset the ongoing decline in its traditional television segment. The Disney+ streaming service added 1.8 million subscribers, and the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. Executives noted that despite concerns about the U.S. consumer, spending at its domestic parks, particularly Walt Disney World, remains very strong. (not investment advice)</p>
