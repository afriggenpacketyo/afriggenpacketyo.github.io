          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on stricter US visa policies and academic funding cuts to recruit top-tier talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhDs and engineers who might have previously stayed in the US. This influx of expertise is intended to fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector and enhance its use of artificial intelligence in the world's second-largest market. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for financial and technological brainpower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's Robotaxi Service Must Have Human Drivers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's plans to expand Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have stated the company is not authorized to operate autonomous vehicles for public transport without a human driver. The California Public Utilities Commission clarified that Tesla's current permit only allows for a charter-party carrier service, similar to a limousine company, which requires a driver to be in control at all times. This regulatory stance presents a significant hurdle for Tesla's ambitions to launch a fully autonomous ride-hailing network in the state, confining its immediate plans to a service with drivers.</p>

          <h2>Inter Miami Owner Criticizes MLS Decision to Suspend Lionel Messi</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:14:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its "draconian" decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players missed the MLS All-Star game, a league rule for unapproved absences. Mas argued that the club made the decision for the players to rest and that the punishment is not understood by them. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's importance to the league but stated the long-standing policy had to be enforced, though it will be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>A salon owner in Leicester is continuing her trademark battle against the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal over the name of her business, "nkd". Rebecca Dowdeswell's attempt to re-register her trademark was opposed by L'Oréal, which owns the "Naked" makeup brand and claims "nkd" would cause consumer confusion. Having already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell is preparing for a crucial hearing with the UK's Intellectual Property Office. She remains defiant, stating she is ready to fight again and will not be pushed aside by the corporate giant.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, has been particularly noticeable, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. While the warm conditions have benefited many species this year, experts caution that a relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year. This year's boom contrasts with 2024's "butterfly emergency," which followed a cool, wet season.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's limits on cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents illegally thwarted federal law enforcement efforts. Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal, a decision praised by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. This ruling marks a significant victory for cities with sanctuary policies and a setback for the administration's broader legal campaign against such local laws.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the late 1940s amid investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer questions about alleged Communist affiliations. It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals to "name names," and extended beyond Hollywood to affect many ordinary Americans. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech and political persecution.</p>

          <p>An article from the BBC examines Donald Trump's deep and transactional relationship with the sport of golf, which he uses as a business venture and a powerful networking tool. Unlike other presidents who used golf for diversion, Trump leverages his courses to forge connections with political allies, foreign leaders, and business elites. The piece notes that a tee time with the president is a coveted opportunity for those seeking influence, reflecting his transactional approach to politics. While on the course, Trump is described as fiercely competitive and focused, blending his passion for the game with his political and business objectives.</p>

          <p>A dedicated group of wildlife biologists is undertaking a mission to save the bighorn sheep population in Texas, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department orchestrated a rescue, capturing dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd. These animals were airlifted, medically checked, and relocated over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range. Recent observations have confirmed the relocated herd is surviving and growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering hope for the species' recovery in the state.</p>

Such an event could create a visible flash and a large crater, sending lunar debris toward Earth.

With the national debt exceeding $36 trillion, the initiative provides a direct, albeit small-scale, way for patriotic or concerned citizens to contribute.
