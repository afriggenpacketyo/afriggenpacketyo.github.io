          <p>Taylor Swift has successfully bought back the rights to her first six albums, marking the end of a long battle over their ownership. The master recordings of Swift's early work were initially sold to Scooter Braun in 2019 and later acquired by Shamrock Capital. Swift announced the news on her website, expressing joy and relief at regaining control of her music. This move follows her previous efforts to re-record those albums, known as "Taylor's Versions," to diminish the value of the original master tapes.</p>

          <p>With home prices and equity levels rising, homeowners are considering borrowing against their equity through loans or lines of credit. While interest rates for these options are lower than other borrowing methods, caution is advised due to the current economic climate. Experts recommend borrowing only what can be comfortably repaid, ideally over a shorter period, and considering future economic conditions. Borrowers should carefully calculate monthly payment costs and factor in potential changes in interest rates and inflation to ensure affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has successfully reacquired the rights to her first six albums, concluding a long-standing dispute over ownership. The saga began in 2019 when Scooter Braun acquired Swift's former record label, gaining control of her early discography. Swift responded by vowing to re-record those albums, releasing "Taylor's Versions" to diminish the value of the original masters. While she has released four re-recorded albums, she had delayed remaking 2017's Reputation, citing its specific connection to that period of her life; however, she promised that vault tracks from the record would be released at a future date.</p>

          <p>A paraglider in China survived an unexpected climb to 28,208 feet without oxygen after being caught in a powerful updraft. Peng Yujiang, an experienced paraglider, was conducting a routine equipment test when he was trapped inside a cumulonimbus cloud system, experiencing a phenomenon known as "cloud suck". Footage shows Peng flying through thick clouds as ice formed around his face and equipment. He has been handed a six-month flight suspension, as the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve signaling that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down high-interest credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores. By switching to a zero-interest balance transfer card, consolidating debt with a lower-rate personal loan, or negotiating with lenders, borrowers can reduce interest payments. Consumers can also benefit from moving their money into high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit before rates potentially decrease.</p>

The premiere was part of a three-day festival, Clarksdale Cultural Capital, featuring panels, music performances, and events celebrating the town's culture.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study in Jama Health Forum estimates that removing fluoride from US public drinking water would result in an additional 25.4 million cavities in children over five years. This would represent a 7.5% increase in cavities, costing $9.8 billion and losing 2.9 million quality-adjusted life years, disproportionately affecting at-risk children. The study contradicts claims made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has advocated for ending water fluoridation, and emphasizes the effectiveness of fluoride in preventing tooth decay. Documented neurotoxic effects are at rates "10-15 times what people are exposed to in public water fluoridation."</p>
