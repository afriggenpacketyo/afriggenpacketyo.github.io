Netflix and Comcast are reportedly among the interested parties, and WBD's CEO David Zaslav acknowledged the market's increasing recognition of the portfolio's value.

          <p>Beyond Meat's stock has seen a significant surge, driven by meme traders, with shares rallying for a third consecutive day. The surge follows the stock's inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME), leading to a short squeeze as investors covered their positions. The company also announced an expansion of distribution at Walmart stores, further boosting the stock. Despite the recent comeback, Beyond Meat's shares have been under pressure for a long time, having fallen significantly in recent years after its public debut in 2019.
