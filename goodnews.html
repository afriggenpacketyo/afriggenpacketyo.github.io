          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against a Trump administration order that sought to deny asylum to individuals crossing the southern border. The court determined that the president does not have the authority under federal law or the Constitution to implement such a sweeping ban. Immigrant rights groups, including the ACLU, had challenged the policy, arguing it was an unprecedented and unlawful prohibition on asylum. The ruling effectively halts the administration's attempt to supplant existing immigration statutes enacted by Congress.</p>

This rate is significantly lower than the 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect as part of a broader "reciprocal" tariff plan. The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at curbing the re-routing of Chinese products. In return, President Trump stated that Vietnam will grant U.S. products full access to its markets with zero tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

He pointed to the new trade deal between the U.S. and Vietnam, which lowered threatened tariffs and caused a jump in the stocks of companies that manufacture there. Additionally, Cramer noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low is beneficial for U.S.-based consumer packaged goods companies, as it makes their exports more competitive abroad.
