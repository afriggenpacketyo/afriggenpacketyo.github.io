          <p>Eli Lilly's daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, has successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global regulatory approval. The oral treatment helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their body weight over 72 weeks, significantly outperforming a placebo. This pill represents a potential needle-free alternative to existing GLP-1 injections, offering greater convenience and potentially broader access. While some patients experienced gastrointestinal side effects, the drug's efficacy and ease of manufacturing are seen as major advantages in the lucrative weight loss market. The article emphasizes the pill's potential to expand treatment options for millions worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account (HYSA) currently earns more interest. It explains that while CD rates are fixed and predictable, HYSA rates are variable and can change. The comparison shows that for shorter terms like three or nine months, a HYSA might yield slightly more, but for six months or a year, a CD could offer better returns. The guaranteed nature of CD earnings is highlighted as a key advantage, despite potential slight variations in overall interest. Savers are advised to consider their liquidity needs and the fixed versus variable rate dynamic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Consolidating Credit Card Debt Without Harming Your Credit Score</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 13:53:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several strategies for Americans struggling with record-high credit card debt to consolidate without negatively impacting their credit scores. Options include enrolling in a debt management program through a credit counseling agency, which can simplify payments and potentially lower interest rates while improving credit utilization over time. Utilizing a personal loan for consolidation is another approach, as it can reduce interest rates and improve credit mix by converting revolving debt to installment debt. Additionally, transferring balances to a new credit card with a low or 0% APR promotional period can provide breathing room, especially if old cards remain open to preserve credit history. Leveraging home equity through loans or HELOCs is also presented as an option, though with inherent risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>S&P 500 Investors Advised to Diversify Due to Narrow Market Concentration in Tech and AI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 13:42:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are advising investors in the S&P 500 index to consider diversifying their portfolios, despite the index's strong performance in 2025. The concern stems from the S&P 500's increasingly narrow market, with the 'Magnificent Seven' technology stocks, particularly those in AI, accounting for a disproportionate share of earnings growth and nearly 40% of the index's top holdings. This concentration suggests an unhealthy market where broader gains are not widespread. Investment strategists recommend actively picking stocks in other sectors like business services, financials, and healthcare, where generative AI's productivity benefits are less priced in. Diversification into smaller-cap stocks or equal-weight indexes is also suggested to mitigate risks associated with this concentrated market. (not investment advice)</p>
