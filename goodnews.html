          <p>Despite concerns over an approaching tariff deadline, several positive factors are currently supporting the stock market. Strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, have set a positive tone for the second-quarter reporting season. Additionally, proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's "big beautiful bill" are expected to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy, boosting consumer spending and business investment. Other tailwinds include massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, relaxed lending standards for banks, and a potential boom in IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ projects that the technology will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. The CEO compared the current state of quantum technology to the 1950s semiconductor industry, acknowledging that significant development is still needed for broad application. SpinQ has already sold its various quantum products to over 50 countries, indicating growing global interest in the field.</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the Claret Jug with a commanding four-stroke victory at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The world's top-ranked player finished the tournament at 17-under-par, solidifying one of the most dominant periods in modern golf. This victory marks his second major championship of 2025 and his fourth overall, leaving him only a U.S. Open win away from completing the career Grand Slam.

          <p>The UK government will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The clash, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what the Home Secretary called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for years, hope it will finally bring truth and accountability for an event still considered a dark chapter in British industrial history.</p>

          <p>An AI platform from Khan Academy, known as Khanmigo, is being piloted in U.S. schools not only as an academic tutor but also as a tool to detect student emotional distress. The AI, designed to guide students to answers through questioning, can flag conversations where students mention self-harm or other concerning topics, alerting teachers and counselors. While some students express privacy concerns over the monitoring, school officials believe the feature provides a crucial safety net. This represents a new frontier for AI in education, extending its role from academic support to student well-being.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods, drawing frequent comparisons from peers and analysts. Since his first major win, Scheffler has captured four major titles and numerous PGA tour victories, establishing himself as the undisputed world number one. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as "silly," his machine-like consistency, calm demeanor, and recent improvements in putting have enabled him to convert leads into victories with a ruthlessness reminiscent of Woods in his prime. His success is attributed to both his mental fortitude and key technical adjustments.</p>
