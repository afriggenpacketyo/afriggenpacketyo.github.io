          <p>The UK government's upcoming Spending Review will include an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector to fund research into areas like drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to ¬£500 million for regions across the UK, with local leaders having a say in how it is spent, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security, with the package expected to be worth more than ¬£22.5 billion-a-year by 2029. Research backers have warned that the government needs to do more to secure the UK's reputation for science on the world stage. </p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Floga archaeological site on the Greek island of Paros have discovered an ancient workshop containing unfinished sculptures. The excavation revealed new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, documenting continuous use of the site from the late 5th to the 4th century BC. The artifacts uncovered include semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, according to archaeologists. </p>

          <p>Nearly six decades after the first human landing, space agencies and commercial companies are once again focused on the moon, with programs like NASA's Artemis aiming to establish a permanent base at the lunar south pole. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, which could be used for self-sufficient lunar bases and as fuel for missions to Mars. Scientific research on the moon aims to make space travel safer and easier, investigating lunar environments and how human activity affects them. Lunar technology development also promises benefits for people on Earth, including advancements in medical equipment and health tracking methods. </p>

          <p>Ahead of this week's Spending Review, analysts are questioning whether the Labour government can convince investors that its economic vision is real. Chief executives express concern that the government appears hesitant despite its large majority. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP over five years, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. Long-term certainty over capital sums could incentivize private investment, especially for green technologies. </p>

          <p>The TSA has announced that Costco cards are not a valid form of identification for air travel, clarifying that travelers must present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or state ID. The agency posted a message on Facebook humorously emphasizing that despite their appreciation for Costco's offerings, the membership card does not meet REAL ID requirements. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, sets standards for identification sources, and all states now issue REAL ID-compliant cards. Confusion may have arisen due to the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to the star markings on REAL ID-compliant documents.</p>

          <h2>Male Childcare Subsidies Could Ease China‚Äôs Demographic Crisis</h2>

          <p>Subsidising men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, according to a new study. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), argued that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidising mothers. The findings came as the world‚Äôs second-largest economy faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce and strained social welfare system ‚Äì before reaching high-income status. The interest in having children has continued to decline in most areas, pushing China‚Äôs overall fertility rate to an estimated 1.1 children per woman. </p>
