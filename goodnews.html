        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The biennial Talisman Sabre military exercise has begun in Australia, featuring over 35,000 personnel from 19 nations in the largest iteration of the drills to date. Originally a joint U.S.-Australia exercise, it now includes participants from across Europe and Asia, with some activities extending to Papua New Guinea for the first time. Australian officials anticipate that Chinese surveillance ships will monitor the exercises, a practice observed since 2017, but stated they will adjust their operations accordingly. The drills showcase Australia's defense alliances amid complex regional dynamics, occurring as the Australian Prime Minister visits China.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Electric Vehicle Brands Gain Significant Market Share in Norway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:10:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are making substantial inroads in Norway, capturing approximately 10% of the market and posing a strong challenge to established brands like Tesla. This growth is notable as Norway, a global leader in EV adoption, does not impose tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, unlike the U.S. and EU. Consumers in Norway are increasingly receptive to Chinese brands such as BYD, XPeng, and MG, recognizing their competitive pricing and advanced technology. The Norwegian market is seen as a key entry point and testing ground for these brands to expand their presence across the European continent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, where Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain, marking the one-year anniversary of a failed assassination attempt on his life. The president was joined by family and advisers, presenting the championship trophy after the match. In a statement, Trump reflected on the anniversary, expressing his conviction that he was saved for a purpose. The event also provided an opportunity for diplomatic engagement, as Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff indicated plans to meet with Qatari officials involved in Gaza ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, exceeding economists' forecasts and buoyed by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets. This growth was aided by a temporary tariff truce with the United States, which slowed the rate of decline in exports to America. Imports also saw their first year-over-year increase of 2025, climbing 1.1%, signaling a potential shift from previously sluggish domestic demand. The data reflects Chinese exporters' successful diversification into markets like Southeast Asia and Europe to offset trade tensions with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting by 0.5% in the first quarter.

Economists suggest the positive performance was partly due to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes.
