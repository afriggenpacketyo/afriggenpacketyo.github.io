          <p>AMD shares experienced a significant rise after Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target on the stock, expressing optimism about a "snapback" for the company's graphics-processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter. This expectation is tied to AMD moving past the bulk of charges related to new U.S. license requirements on semiconductor exports to China. The company recently unveiled its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including a full-server rack called Helios, which is expected to be crucial for AI customers. AMD CEO Lisa Su presented these products with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, further boosting confidence in the company's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article reflects on the unusual scene in Washington, D.C., where supporters and opponents of Donald Trump mingled at the American History Museum, momentarily setting aside their political differences. The author observed a neutral atmosphere where families with opposing political views could coexist, admiring historical artifacts. Outside the museum, security measures were heightened due to both the U.S. Army 250th Birthday Parade and anti-Trump protests, raising questions about the financial costs of such security. The author notes that face-to-face interactions allowed for respectful political discourse, suggesting that physical interaction can mitigate hatred and fear, a phenomenon often undermined by online siloing.</p>

Credit card rates, already near all-time highs, may continue to edge higher, prompting consumers to consider balance transfers or personal loans. Mortgage rates are expected to remain relatively stable, keeping housing affordability a challenge. Auto loan rates, which are fixed, are not directly tied to the Fed, but rising car prices are increasing payments. Federal student loan rates are set annually, providing some stability for borrowers, although forgiveness options are diminishing. (not investment advice)</p>
