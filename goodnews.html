          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of Japanese seafood from certain regions, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The initial ban was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. However, the suspension remains in effect for ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. This move is seen as a potential step toward resetting diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries, which had been strained over the issue. The ban's extension last year had covered all aquatic products from Japan, impacting the industry significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before the first payments were due. The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade negotiations with Canada in response to the tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on firms like Amazon and Google. Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade agreement and would support a resumption of negotiations. The tax, which was to be applied retroactively to 2022, was designed to address a gap where tech giants earned significant revenue from Canadians without being taxed locally.

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, U.S. Women's National Team coach Emma Hayes reflects on her transition to American soccer, noting the culture around the women's game is more ingrained than in the UK. She identifies a roast dinner and proper milk for tea as the things she misses most from home. Hayes emphasizes that great coaches must show empathy, have a clear vision, and be vulnerable with their teams. When asked about potentially managing the England national team one day, she stated she would "never say never," keeping the possibility open for the future after her tenure with the U.S. team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British car manufacturers are resuming large-scale shipments to the United States as a new trade deal reducing a 25% tariff to 10% comes into effect. The deal is expected to unleash pent-up demand for brands like Mini, Aston Martin, and Range Rover, which had seen exports plummet. However, the agreement has drawn criticism from British farmers, who argue their sector was used as a bargaining chip to secure concessions for the auto industry. The deal includes a 100,000-vehicle annual quota and has yet to resolve similar tariff issues for the UK steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Research Links Electric Vehicle Characteristics to Increased Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, studies are revealing they are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this to the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems. This feature, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness in passengers. According to Chinese researchers, this issue affects not only passenger comfort but also their health, as it can cause feelings of tension and fidgetiness during travel.</p>

          <p>Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams has been forced to withdraw from the remainder of the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia due to a hamstring injury. The injury occurred during the Lions' victory over the Western Force in Perth, where Williams had scored a try. His departure is a significant blow, leaving flanker Jac Morgan as the only remaining Welsh player in the 38-man squad. Scotland's Ben White has been called up from his international duties in New Zealand to join the Lions camp as Williams' replacement.</p>

In New York, marchers demonstrated against recent policies from the Trump administration targeting transgender people and diversity programs. In Budapest, an estimated 100,000 people defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, marching in protest of Hungary's increasingly restrictive laws. The events highlighted a global atmosphere where joy and community visibility serve as forms of resistance against what many see as a rollback of hard-won rights and protections.</p>
