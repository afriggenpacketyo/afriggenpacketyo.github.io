          <h2>UK Energy Bills Set to Decrease Slightly in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 03:26:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year, which translates to a ¬£129 annual saving for a typical household. While this reduction is welcome news, charities emphasize that many individuals still struggle with energy costs, collectively owing suppliers around ¬£4 billion. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. The decrease is attributed to a fall in international wholesale gas prices, though prices remain higher than previous years and customer debt continues to be a significant issue.</p>

During a telephone conversation, both leaders emphasized the need to achieve "win-win" bilateral relations through these negotiations, with Ishiba expressing his hope for a productive outcome at the ministerial level. Japan has been urging the United States to reconsider its tariff policy, including a 25 percent import duty on cars, due to concerns about its impact on the export-driven Japanese economy.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to halt penny production following President Donald Trump's directive to abolish the coin, which he deems "so wasteful." The decision, supported by the US Treasury, anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny costs almost four cents to produce, yet is underutilized, according to the Treasury. Advocates for eliminating the penny cite its high production cost and limited utility, while others emphasize its value in charity drives and cheaper production cost compared to the nickel coin.</p>

          <p>Japanese veteran Kei Nishikori, recovering from injuries, is set to face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the first round of the French Open. The French Open, the second Grand Slam on the tennis calendar, begins Sunday. Nishikori recently withdrew from his second-round match at the Geneva Open due to a sore back.

          <p>An investigation is underway following the collapse of a roof at the Fengyang Drum Tower, a historic tourist site in central China, which underwent a major renovation last year. Hundreds of tiles fell off the roof of the tower in Anhui province, prompting questions about the quality of the repair work. The tower, built in 1375, underwent extensive repairs in 1995 and again in 2023, with the most recent project costing 2.9 million yuan. Allegations have surfaced that the contractor illegally subcontracted renovations to unqualified personnel.</p>
