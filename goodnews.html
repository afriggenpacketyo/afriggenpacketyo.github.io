          <p>President Trump has proposed a plan to redirect $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to fund vocational schools across the country. This announcement follows previous actions to freeze or withdraw funds from Harvard, based on the administration's claims of antisemitism and promotion of liberal ideology. Trump also accused Harvard of being slow to provide information on "foreign student lists," seeking to identify potentially problematic individuals.
