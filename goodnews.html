          <p>New Orleans expects National Guard troops to arrive by late November, as confirmed by Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, in response to a request from Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry. The deployment aims to support local law enforcement for major upcoming events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras, enhancing public safety. Kirkpatrick emphasized the collaborative nature of the deployment, distinguishing it as a partnership rather than a federal takeover, despite the city's ongoing police understaffing issues. This assistance follows a previous deployment earlier in the year after a New Year's Day terror attack.</p>

          <p>Airbus has inaugurated its second final assembly line in Tianjin, China, marking its tenth global assembly line for the best-selling A320neo family of single-aisle jets. This significant expansion, set to be fully operational by early 2026, aims to substantially boost manufacturing capacity for the European planemaker. The move underscores Airbus's strategic commitment to the growing Chinese market and its efforts to strengthen trade ties, occurring shortly after opening a similar line in Mobile, Alabama. The careful timing of these back-to-back ceremonies reflects a diplomatic approach to navigating complex trade relations between major global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles communities are experiencing widespread darkness due to surging copper wire thefts, prompting a new statewide metal theft law set to take effect next year. Assembly Bill 476 targets recyclers by requiring identity verification and lawful ownership proof for scrap metal purchases, increasing penalties for non-compliance. The law aims to reduce the incentive for thieves, as repairs for stolen wire, like the $2.5 million needed for the Sixth Street Bridge, far exceed the metal's value. City officials are also exploring solar lighting and updated maintenance funding to address the extensive outages and restore public safety.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills "quicker and easier," addressing widespread public concern over pollution. The plans include automatic financial penalties up to £20,000 for minor offenses and a reduced burden of proof for more serious ones, potentially allowing fines of up to £500,000 without court proceedings. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds aims to give the Environment Agency stronger enforcement powers, expecting to raise £50m-£67m annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers. This initiative represents a significant step towards greater accountability and environmental protection.</p>

The article advises against excessive dry shampoo use, recommending it only once between washes to maintain optimal scalp health and avoid issues like itchiness and flakiness.
