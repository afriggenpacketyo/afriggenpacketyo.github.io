          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is supported by increasing institutional investment and anticipation of a clearer regulatory framework, as the U.S. Congress is set to deliberate on new crypto-related legislation. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the coming months, despite potential short-term volatility from international trade disputes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports in June grew by 5.8% year-over-year, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. This growth occurred despite a continued, albeit slowing, decline in shipments to the United States, which was partially offset by a temporary tariff truce. While imports also saw their first increase of the year, the overall data highlights Chinese exporters' successful diversification efforts amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of 'significant uncertainty and downside risks' for the second half of the year, citing a lack of clarity over U.S. tariff policies and global trade volatility.

Her case, which resulted in the conviction of 51 men, shocked the nation and was a catalyst for legal reforms, including adding a lack of consent to the criminal definition of sexual assault.</p>
