          <p>Maureen McCormick, known for her role as Marcia Brady, recently celebrated her 40th wedding anniversary with husband Michael Cummings. The couple attributes their long-lasting Hollywood marriage to maintaining a sense of humor and not taking things too seriously. McCormick also highlighted the importance of celebrating their differences and noted it was refreshing that Cummings was unaware of her fame when they first met. The article also touches upon her past struggles with addiction and how her husband's support was crucial to her over 40 years of sobriety.</p>

          <p>In response to recent global concerns over aviation manufacturing quality, China has developed a futuristic assembly line for its C919 passenger jet. The system integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect all tools, robots, and workers, creating a unified intelligent loop for sensing, transmission, and control. This advanced "smart factory" aims to eliminate manual oversight errors, such as missing bolts, by ensuring every component and action is monitored in real-time. The technology represents a significant step in automating and securing aircraft production processes.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely partners in the ongoing proposal to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump also mentioned that Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell are probably involved, describing the potential investors as "American patriots." The comments come as the administration continues to work out the final details of a deal to address national security concerns related to the popular video-sharing app. The specifics of the agreement between the U.S. and China remain under negotiation.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview, French President Emmanuel Macron explained his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move he will announce at the United Nations. He argues that recognition is not a reward for Hamas but a necessary step to provide a political alternative for the Palestinian people and isolate the terrorist group. Macron outlined a multi-phase plan involving a ceasefire, hostage release, and a transitional governance structure for Gaza, asserting this approach will re-engage regional partners. He contends that a purely military strategy against Hamas has failed, as the group continues to recruit new members.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 11:24:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, an organized swim was held in the Chicago River, with about 300 people participating in the mile-long event. This milestone highlights the dramatic transformation of the waterway, which was once notoriously polluted with sewage and industrial waste. Decades of cleanup efforts, spurred by the Clean Water Act, have restored the river's ecosystem, allowing for the return of fish and wildlife. The event symbolizes a renewed connection between Chicago residents and their river, turning a former "stinking river" into a celebrated recreational space.</p>

          <h2>Expert Explains How Chronic Stress Accelerates Cellular Aging and Offers Tips for Mitigation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. This cellular damage can be reversed by adopting lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle" and provide restorative breaks for the body's cells. Epel recommends simple, sustainable practices to lower stress, such as eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short daily breaks or meditation, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga. These small adjustments, maintained over time, can help slow the rate of aging and improve overall health.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is taking on his most ambitious acting challenge yet, portraying real-life MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." In an interview, Johnson revealed he was nervous about the raw, dramatic role, which required him to tap into personal trauma to convey the character's struggles with addiction and depression. He explained that after years of focusing on box office success, he felt unfulfilled and desired a role that would allow him to "rip myself open." Johnson views this film as the start of a "whole new book" in his career.</p>

          <p>The Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has banned the use of plastic flying rings on its beaches to prevent harm to the local seal population. These toys can get stuck around the necks of curious young seals, leading to severe injury, infection, and death. The ban is voluntary, but the council hopes it will encourage public support and has also called for a UK-wide legislative ban on the products. This local action follows similar moves by other coastal councils and retailers in response to a national campaign by the UK Seal Alliance.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl explains the holiday's central theme of "Teshuvah," which translates to "return." She describes this period not just as a time for individual resolutions but as a communal accounting of shortcomings, with the hopeful message that people and societies can change for the better. Rabbi Buchdahl suggests that the nation could benefit from this practice of collective responsibility, acknowledging where "we" have fallen short in areas like compassion and understanding. She concludes with a hopeful message for a return to our "better selves" and the nation's core values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model key behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about feelings, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and validating a child's emotions rather than dismissing them. The article suggests that instead of lecturing, parents should listen more, treat mistakes as learning opportunities, and allow children space to resolve minor conflicts themselves. This approach helps build authentic confidence and emotional intelligence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card expert advises consumers to avoid common mistakes when using rewards cards, such as choosing no-annual-fee options and hoarding points. According to Brian Kelly of The Points Guy, cards with modest annual fees typically offer significantly better rewards that justify the cost for most spenders. He also warns against accumulating large point balances, as their value can be devalued by issuers at any time, recommending instead that users redeem them regularly. If a card's fee feels too high, he suggests calling the issuer to negotiate for retention offers before downgrading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers analyzing the DNA of two 7,000-year-old mummies from the Takarkori rock shelter in Libya have discovered a unique genetic lineage previously unknown to science. The remains belong to female herders who lived during the "Green Sahara" period when the region was a humid savannah. Contrary to expectations, their ancestry is not closely related to Sub-Saharan populations but instead stems from a distinct North African group that remained largely isolated. This finding suggests that pastoralism and other cultural practices may have spread through the exchange of ideas rather than large-scale migrations.</p>

Proponents argue that a full map could unlock scientific discoveries, reveal insights into past climate change, and identify new ecosystems. However, there are concerns that a detailed map could also accelerate deep-sea exploitation, such as mining for resources in largely unregulated international waters. The ambitious project faces challenges including high costs, geopolitical tensions, and the sheer vastness of the oceans.</p>
