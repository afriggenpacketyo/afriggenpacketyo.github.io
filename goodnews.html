          <h2>Trump Administration to Establish National Standards for College Athlete Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 23:07:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program, which allows college athletes to earn money. This follows 2021 rule changes and a recent court settlement permitting schools to pay student-athletes directly, a major shift from the NCAA's long-standing amateurism model. The order aims to create a uniform federal framework, superseding the varied state laws that currently govern NIL compensation. However, there are bipartisan concerns that the new rules might grant excessive power to the NCAA rather than prioritizing the interests of the athletes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that would set a 19% tariff on its U.S. exports, a reduction from a previously threatened 32% rate. As part of the agreement, Trump stated that Indonesia has committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as dozens of Boeing jets. However, the Indonesian government has not yet publicly confirmed these terms, creating uncertainty around the deal's finality. This follows a pattern of similar trade announcements with other nations where details remained unconfirmed by the other party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After initially blocking a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills, a group of House Republicans reversed their position following a meeting with President Trump. The legislation, which includes the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, had failed a key procedural vote in a rare instance of GOP lawmakers defying the president. Following the White House discussion, the holdouts agreed to advance the bills, demonstrating Trump's continued influence over the party. The event underscores the administration's push to establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets.</p>

          <p>At a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump and corporate leaders announced over $90 billion in private sector investments for Pennsylvania. The funds are intended to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's energy resources to power energy-intensive AI data centers. The plan includes building new facilities and an innovation center to train workers for jobs in the energy and AI sectors. While organizers touted the creation of tens of thousands of jobs, the event also drew protests from activists concerned about fossil fuels and AI surveillance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is releasing 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal mission in Los Angeles, reducing the deployed force by half. The troops were sent to the city over a month ago, against the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, to respond to protests related to immigration enforcement. The Pentagon stated the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding." Governor Newsom has called for the remaining 2,000 troops to be sent home as well, calling their deployment a political maneuver.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to be less volatile by pegging its value to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. It details the proposed GENIUS Act, bipartisan legislation that aims to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bill would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers, potentially paving the way for wider adoption in mainstream finance. Major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are already exploring how to integrate these digital currencies into their services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his country's commitment to economic globalization and free trade in an article published by a leading Communist Party journal.

He advocated for an inclusive multilateral trading system, positioning China as a champion of free trade in contrast to the more protectionist policies emerging elsewhere.

          <p>An article in China's state-run People's Daily has called on local governments to utilize their legislative powers to foster economic and social development. The piece argues that creating stable, open legal systems is a more effective tool for growth than relying on direct orders from higher authorities. This reflects a broader shift in governance, where cities are encouraged to draft laws tailored to their specific local needs, particularly in areas like urban development and environmental protection. The article suggests that effective local legislation is crucial for long-term progress.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming season: an all-gold "Charger Power" design and a navy blue "Super Chargers" look. The all-gold uniform, a first in the team's game-day history, has sparked a wide range of reactions online, drawing comparisons to everything from bananas to mustard. The navy uniform is a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance.</p>

          <p>Amanda Knox has publicly responded to criticism surrounding a diary entry from 2007 that listed her previous sexual partners. The entry was written while she was being interrogated for murder after Italian police lied, telling her she had HIV, and then demanded she list her partners before leaking the diary to the media. Knox pushed back against online shaming by explaining the coercive context of the entry, highlighting the violation of her rights and privacy during the ordeal. Her case ultimately led to her full exoneration by Italy's highest court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks around the world are increasingly buying gold directly from mines within their own countries, according to a new report from the World Gold Council. This trend is driven by record-high gold prices and allows central banks to increase their reserves using local currency instead of foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. The practice is seen as a cheaper alternative to buying on the international market and provides support for the domestic mining industry, though it can present challenges related to refining and reputational risks.

          <p>Michael Petrilli, president of the conservative-leaning Thomas B.

While a recent Supreme Court decision allows layoffs to proceed, Petrilli believes the department will not be completely eliminated as that would require an act of Congress. He argued that the cuts will have little direct impact on the daily operations of most schools, as education in the U.S. is primarily funded and managed at the state and local levels.</p>

          <p>An independent review for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants." This change is intended to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review also advised that these professionals should not be responsible for diagnosing patients and should wear standardized uniforms. The recommendations come after growing concerns from patient groups and doctors' unions about patient safety and role clarity.</p>
