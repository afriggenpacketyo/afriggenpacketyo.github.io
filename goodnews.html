          <p>Microsoft is laying off 3% of its global workforce, affecting approximately 6,000 employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, the company announced on Tuesday. The move is part of an organizational restructuring aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected financial results in April, Microsoft aims to enhance efficiency by reducing management layers and streamlining processes. This is the largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023 and the company's home state of Washington said the company was reducing headcount in the state by 1,985 people, including 1,510 in office.</p>

          <p>Key House committees are meeting to discuss President Trump's budget package, facing significant Republican divisions over Medicaid and tax deductions. The Energy and Commerce Committee proposes changes to Medicaid, including work requirements and eligibility checks, while the Ways and Means Committee aims to extend Trump's tax cuts and increase the Child Tax Credit. The Agriculture Committee seeks to increase the age requirement for SNAP benefits. The package faces challenges as some Republicans demand steeper cuts to Medicaid and others disagree on the state and local tax deduction cap, with House leaders aiming to send the package to the Senate by Memorial Day.</p>

          <p>During a speech at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, President Trump lauded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) for his leadership and the kingdom's economic development. Trump credited MBS for transforming Riyadh into a major business and high-tech capital, announcing the end of sanctions against Syria, seemingly at Saudi Arabia's request. This marks a shift from previous U.S. stances, particularly considering the criticism former President Biden faced for his interactions with MBS. Trump also emphasized his own economic agenda and immigration policies during the address, noting the strong economic growth in both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.</p>

Trump stated the decision aims to give Syria a chance at greatness under its new government, hoping for stability and peace in the region. He noted that his administration has already taken steps to restore normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in over a decade. This decision follows Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary reduction in tariffs between the United States and China, uncertainty persists in the financial markets regarding the long-term economic outlook. While the tariff pause has boosted stock prices and eased volatility in the bond market, investors remain cautious due to the unpredictable nature of trade policy under President Trump. The Federal Reserve is also taking a wait-and-see approach, unwilling to lower interest rates until the inflationary effects of the tariffs are better understood. This prolonged uncertainty could dampen business investment and consumer spending, slowing economic growth.</p>
