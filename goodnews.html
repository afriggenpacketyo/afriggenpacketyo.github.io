          <h2>Chinese Policy Adviser Argues for an 'Indigenous' Approach for the Nation's Think Tanks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a policy adviser in Beijing, asserts that Chinese think tanks must adopt a "self-centred" approach to effectively project the country's soft power. He argues that these institutions should focus on developing an "indigenous knowledge system" based on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic models. This shift would enable a better explanation of Chinese policies and a more accurate prediction of the nation's future trajectory. Zheng contrasts this with university research, which he suggests is often stuck in Western textbook theories.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, have reportedly docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic in-orbit refueling mission. According to space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the satellites appeared "visually merged" for several days after conducting multiple close-approach maneuvers, a feat not yet achieved by the United States. This development in autonomous satellite servicing represents a significant advancement in China's space capabilities. The operation was reportedly observed by US surveillance satellites positioned for optimal viewing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers to purchase. While not confirming specific details like grants, she guaranteed that announcements later in the week will focus on affordability to encourage more drivers to switch. The move comes alongside a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. The high upfront cost of EVs compared to petrol cars is seen as a major barrier to meeting the UK's 2030 sales targets.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated price of $2 to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. This rare specimen represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet. The auction is part of a natural history sale that also features a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered the well-preserved wreck of a ship that sank in 1880. The team was mapping other known cultural sites when they found the partially buried hull, believed to be the L.W. Crane, a wooden paddle wheel steamer. The vessel reportedly caught fire and sank over 140 years ago. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, and further investigations of the site are now underway to learn more about the vessel.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a novel biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, or white sugar, without needing to grow crops like sugar cane. Because methanol can be derived from captured carbon dioxide, the process offers a potential pathway to turn a primary greenhouse gas directly into food. The researchers from the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology say this "artificial conversion" strategy could help address both environmental challenges and global food security. The method has also been adapted to produce other complex carbohydrates like starch.</p>

As IUD use has grown, so have patient accounts of extreme discomfort, challenging the long-held perception of it being a minor procedure. Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recently issued recommendations for doctors to discuss and offer better pain management options.

This comes as Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life after viewing harmful content, urged the regulator Ofcom to rigorously enforce the new rules.

This "no tunnel, no toxic waste" approach involves injecting chemicals underground to dissolve uranium directly from sandstone deposits, avoiding traditional excavation and minimizing environmental impact. The success of this demonstration project is being hailed as a significant step toward a greener, more efficient, and safer method of uranium extraction. This technology could boost China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium sector.</p>
