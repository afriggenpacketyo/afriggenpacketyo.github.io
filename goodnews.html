          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen successfully overcame two no-confidence votes in the European Parliament, initiated by hard-right and hard-left factions. While the motions did not have a realistic chance of passing, the results highlighted the growing fragmentation within the parliament. Von der Leyen secured support from just over half the members, with 383 votes in her favor in the second motion. This narrow majority underscores the increasing difficulty her Commission faces in building consensus to pass new legislation, reflecting a more fractured European political landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 06:35:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England and Wales has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing laws, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars. The proposed reforms aim to support the struggling hospitality industry by cutting red tape, making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music. While industry groups have welcomed the move as a way to reduce costs and increase flexibility, critics have raised concerns that relaxing alcohol rules could lead to a rise in antisocial behavior. The review follows a steady decline in the number of UK pubs since 2000.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has reportedly been reached, with President Donald Trump announcing that both sides have signed off on the first phase of a peace plan. The deal, expected to be ratified by the Israeli government, includes the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. It also involves a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, marking a significant step toward de-escalation. Despite the impending ceasefire, intense Israeli attacks continued across Gaza, with the local health ministry reporting 10 additional fatalities.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to strong performance in international markets. This growth helped to counterbalance another quarter of declining sales volume in North America for both its food and beverage divisions. The company's net sales rose 2.6% to $23.94 billion, although overall worldwide volume for its products, including brands like Doritos and Gatorade, fell by 1%. Despite the softer demand in its home market, PepsiCo has reiterated its full-year financial outlook, expecting stable earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mormon Women for Ethical Government (MWEG), a non-partisan civic group, is a key plaintiff in a lawsuit that has compelled Utah's legislature to redraw its congressional district maps. The group sued after the Republican-supermajority legislature nullified a voter-approved independent commission and passed a map that heavily favored their party by splitting Salt Lake County. A state court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the new map to be drawn, which improves Democrats' chances of winning a seat. MWEG members see their activism as an extension of their faith, focused on upholding democratic principles and ensuring fair representation.</p>
