          <p>This article profiles Haley Amaya, a 27-year-old model and dancer from Los Angeles who is dedicated to preserving her Honduran heritage. Raised by a single immigrant mother, Amaya navigated a challenging childhood in Koreatown, finding an outlet and a career path through art and dance. She founded the "Cinco Estrellas" ballet to offer free Honduran folk dance classes to children, aiming to instill a sense of identity and keep them engaged in positive activities. Despite her success in the competitive modeling industry, she considers her role as a cultural ambassador her most important work, using her platform to connect new generations with their roots.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Appointed to head the FBI by President Carter in 1978, he was credited with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal and expanding its capabilities to address terrorism. In 1987, President Reagan tapped him to lead the CIA, where he worked to rebuild trust with Congress following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his integrity and non-partisan approach, Webster's long career in public service also included time as a federal judge and prosecutor before his appointments in Washington.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the widely cited "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, now suggests a higher rate of 4.7% is safe for a 30-year retirement. In a new book, he argues that most retirees are too conservative and could spend more by using a more sophisticated and diversified investment strategy that includes small-company stocks and a rising equity glide path. Bengen's updated research accounts for a wider range of assets and historical market conditions, noting that high inflation remains the biggest threat to retirement portfolios. He emphasizes that this is a baseline for the worst-case scenario, and many could withdraw even more (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new exhibition explores the life and work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her era, even surpassing Rembrandt and Vermeer in fame during her lifetime. The daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch channeled her unique upbringing surrounded by preserved natural specimens into creating intricate and vibrant still-life paintings. The article details her successful career, which spanned nearly 70 years, and the context of the Dutch Golden Age, where her art converted perishable, exotic flowers from a global empire into permanent, treasured objects. Her work is examined as a blend of aesthetic beauty, scientific detail, and moral messaging.</p>

          <p>In a sign of potentially easing tensions, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. The move follows a similar action by Seoul earlier in the week and appears to be a positive response to diplomatic overtures from South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung. The cross-border broadcasts, which had been a source of friction for years, were recently resumed in response to a campaign of trash-filled balloons sent from the North. The dismantling of the speakers suggests a mutual effort to de-escalate and improve inter-Korean relations after a period of heightened animosity.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new life by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues, and hotels. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people to the mall each week, boosting traffic for remaining retailers. Industry experts note that this trend of subdividing large retail spaces for a mix of tenants, including popular destinations like Barnes & Noble and Dave & Buster's, is driving a rebound in mall visits. This strategy creates a new kind of community hub, appealing to younger generations who value in-person experiences.</p>

          <p>After a helmet-to-helmet hit during a high school football game, New Jersey teen Logan Coleridge experienced debilitating concussion symptoms for months that therapies failed to resolve. When a specialist finally ordered an MRI, doctors discovered the true cause was not the concussion but a rare, underlying condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. The AVM, which was likely the source of his chronic headaches all along, posed a significant risk of rupture and brain bleeding. Logan successfully underwent surgery to remove the AVM and is now recovering, with his family advocating for earlier diagnostic imaging for persistent post-concussion symptoms.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA officer instrumental in unmasking notorious Soviet spy Aldrich Ames, has died at the age of 79. In 1991, Grimes, who was considering scaling back her career, agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs revealed a pattern linking Ames, then the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, to large cash deposits after meetings with a Soviet official. Her work was crucial in the 1994 arrest of Ames, who was responsible for what the Senate Intelligence Committee called some of the most severe damage in CIA history.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing tons of gold by repurposing neutrons generated during the nuclear fusion process. The speculative idea, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that transmuting mercury into gold could create a valuable revenue stream to subsidize the high cost of developing fusion energy. While scientists have created gold in labs before, the process has always been prohibitively expensive. This new proposal links the alchemist's dream to the quest for clean energy, though it remains entirely theoretical, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist, which is the most significant barrier to the vision.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by separating its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business from its legacy Communications segment. In a letter, Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, undervaluing it due to the perceived threat from competitors like Starlink to its declining broadband division. The firm contends that the high-growth, high-margin DAT business is a "hidden gem" that would be valued much higher as a standalone entity. A separation via spin-off or IPO could lead to a significant increase in the company's total valuation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In a major diplomatic achievement for the Trump administration, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, ending decades of conflict. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes normal relations and reopens key transportation routes, including a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be named the "Trump Route." Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev both credited President Trump for the breakthrough. The agreement marks a significant geopolitical development in the South Caucasus, diminishing Russia's long-standing influence as the primary mediator in the region.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's launch of its new flagship model, GPT-5, has drawn a mixed reaction from experts and the public in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touted the model as the company's "smartest, fastest, most useful" yet, with improved performance and a built-in "thinking" function, some Chinese analysts were underwhelmed. One prominent AI blogger described GPT-5 as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs or memorable characteristics. The reception comes as Chinese tech firms are aggressively developing their own large language models, creating a highly competitive environment where incremental updates are closely scrutinized for their innovative value.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the ambitious Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic project aimed at connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. A new company has been established to oversee the railway, which will form a 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) artery by linking the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan. This railway is a key component of a larger plan to create a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035. The project's business scope extends beyond transportation to include real estate development, tourism, and international contracting, signaling its broad economic and strategic importance for the country.</p>
