        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>G.O.P. lawmakers in swing districts are facing tough decisions regarding budget cuts to popular programs to fund President Trump's agenda. Representative Gabe Evans of Colorado, whose district includes many Medicaid recipients, is helping to write legislation that could significantly reduce Medicaid spending. The Republican budget resolution instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, where Evans sits, to slash spending by $880 billion over the next decade, making substantial Medicaid cuts unavoidable. These lawmakers are caught between supporting their party's agenda and potentially alienating constituents who rely on these programs.</p>

Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison for defrauding investors about the capabilities of Theranos, her blood-testing company.

          <p>President Trump unveiled the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since pausing "reciprocal" tariffs. The deal retains a 10% U.S. tariff on U.K. imports but adjusts tariffs on U.K. autos, creating a $5 billion export opportunity for U.S. farmers and producers. The agreement also commits both countries to enhancing industrial and agricultural market access and streamlining customs procedures for U.S. exports. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal, some experts downplayed its impact, noting that the U.S. has a trade surplus with the U.K., limiting its broader applicability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, a policy his administration previously attempted to implement. This plan ties the prices of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and stakeholder concerns. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested the policy's return, citing high prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic, while also defending the decision not to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid due to their prohibitive costs.</p>

          <p>A trade deal with the United Kingdom announced by the White House marked the first of its kind since President Trump launched sweeping global tariffs last month, offering a glimpse into the Trump administration‚Äôs negotiating strategy. The agreement kept the U.S. baseline tariff rate on U.K. imports at 10%, while eliminating duties on British aluminum and steel and significantly lowering tariffs on a limited number of U.K. car exports. In exchange, the White House said that London had agreed to lower barriers on U.S. farmers and ranchers seeking access to the U.K. market for exports like ethanol and beef, and to increase access for U.S. aerospace companies to critical British-made components.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade deal with the United Kingdom, which includes increased market access for American exports, especially in agriculture. The deal also includes new market access for American chemicals, machinery and industrial products. The 10-percent universal baseline tariff levied on the U.K. last month will remain in place, creating potential tariff revenue of $6 billion for the U.S. government, while the U.K. has agreed to reduce tariffs on U.S. goods and services from 5.1 percent to 1.8 percent.</p>
