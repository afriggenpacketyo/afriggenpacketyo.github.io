          <p>Despite uncertainties surrounding U.S. support, Europe is expressing growing optimism about its ability to defend Ukraine. European nations possess the financial resources and artillery shells necessary for sustained defense efforts. However, replacing key U.S. capabilities such as operational intelligence and air defense systems remains a significant challenge. This shift in European confidence underscores a proactive stance in regional security, yet it also highlights the critical role of transatlantic cooperation. The evolving dynamics reflect Europe's determination to bolster its defense capabilities in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 12:39:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns about potential disruptions under Donald Trump's administration, a strong federal government remains essential for addressing societal challenges. The article argues that the issue with Trump's presidency is not the government's size but rather the lack of adequate oversight. Reducing governmental power would not necessarily protect citizens and could even consolidate power in undesirable ways. The author contends that a robust government is necessary for providing a social safety net, funding essential services, and regulating commerce. This perspective emphasizes the importance of checks and balances to constrain government overreach, making oversight, not shrinking government, the key to safeguarding democracy.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, including both employee and company contributions, reached a record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employees deferred 9.5% into 401(k) plans, while companies contributed 4.8%. A significant portion of the increased employee deferrals came from auto-escalations, which automatically raise savings rates over time. Financial experts recommend aiming to save at least 15% of pretax income annually to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant deported to El Salvador. The order, responding to a media coalition request, found that the public has a right to access court records, which outweighs the Justice Department's concerns about national security and discovery materials. The Justice Department had opposed the request, citing typical restrictions on discovery materials and the need to protect national security. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status preventing his removal to El Salvador due to potential persecution by local gangs. The Trump administration is seeking to dismiss Abrego Garcia's case.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has abolished its longstanding two-child policy to address a declining birth rate and a shrinking working-age population. Lawmakers passed new amendments to the Population Law, allowing families to decide how many children they wish to have. The policy, in place since 2009, restricted families to one or two children, particularly government officials and Communist Party members. The change reflects concerns about the country's falling fertility rate and the need to maintain a sufficient working-age population. The government is also addressing sex imbalances caused by prenatal gender selection.</p>
