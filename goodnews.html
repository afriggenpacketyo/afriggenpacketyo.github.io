          <p>President Trump has announced a planned partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, projecting it will create 70,000 jobs and boost the U.S. economy by $14 billion. The White House suggests Trump has approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, despite previous national security concerns. Both companies have expressed their support for the decision, with Nippon Steel applauding Trump's action and U.S. Steel appreciating his leadership. The Committee on Foreign Investment initially reviewed the deal under President Biden, who had previously blocked it, but Trump reexamined the proposal after winning the election.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, particularly amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarization. Businesses in Qatar are interested in leveraging Hong Kong's yuan capabilities for investments and trades with China. The increase in yuan-denominated transactions could benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially as ties between China and oil-rich Qatar strengthen. This trend reflects a broader effort to de-dollarize in response to US trade policies, aligning with China's long-term strategy to mitigate risks and achieve financial independence.</p>

The actors shared personal anecdotes, including early career mishaps, moments of self-doubt, and insights into their creative processes. Janney revealed that she almost became a systems analyst due to being deemed 'uncastable' early in her career because of her height. The conversation touched on the actors' approaches to portraying complex characters and the impact of real-world anxieties on their roles, offering a glimpse into the lives and perspectives of performers navigating the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in A&E departments and provide appropriate care for individuals experiencing mental distress. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to offer timely support and prevent hospital admissions. NHS England anticipates the new units will reduce pressure on emergency services, but Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health has expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and careful testing of the model before national rollout. A recent study revealed a high number of patients waiting extended hours in A&E, highlighting the urgency for improved mental health services.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The loss of contact, lasting about 20 seconds, occurred as the helicopter approached the Pentagon. An antenna used for communication was temporarily positioned in a location that did not maintain consistent contact with the helicopter. The FAA is investigating, and the Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety concerns after a previous deadly midair collision in January.</p>

Concerns are rising that some vapers may return to smoking cigarettes or purchase disposable vapes from other countries. Retailers are worried about financial losses due to unsold stock, and some believe the ban will not significantly change vaping habits.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to make it available at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms. The move is intended to address mounting criticism over rising rice prices that have hurt households amid inflation. Koizumi is also exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons of stockpiled grain initially.</p>
