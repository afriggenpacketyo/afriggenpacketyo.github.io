The lawsuit, filed in May by a woman referred to as Jane Doe, alleged an incident occurred in November 2023, for which Retzlaff was never criminally charged. While the dismissal resolves his legal battle, Retzlaff still faces a potential seven-game suspension from BYU for violating the university's strict honor code, as his defense acknowledged a consensual sexual encounter, which is prohibited for students.</p>

          <p>After a significant price surge over the last 18 months, gold prices are expected to remain relatively stable through July, with minor fluctuations. Key factors contributing to this stability include inflation holding steady around 2.4% and the Federal Reserve's likely decision to continue its pause on interest rate cuts until at least September. While geopolitical tensions can be an unpredictable driver of gold prices, the current muddled global landscape is not expected to cause major shifts, though any sudden changes could quickly alter the forecast for the precious metal.
