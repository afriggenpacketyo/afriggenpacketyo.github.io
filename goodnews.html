          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived in Canada for the King's first visit since his coronation, marking his 20th trip to the country overall. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to deliver the Speech from the Throne, inaugurating the 45th session of Canada's parliament, a task typically performed by the governor general. This marks the first time a monarch has delivered the speech since 1977, underscoring Canada's sovereignty amid strained relations with the United States.

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, has become the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing the 62-mile journey in 12 days.

He emphasized that sharks are essential for a healthy ocean ecosystem and that current shark killing rates are unsustainable. The swim was particularly challenging due to the cold water, strong winds, and the constant awareness of sharks in the water.</p>

The B-24 bomber "Heaven Can Wait" was shot down in 1944, killing all 11 crew members; the recovery mission was initiated after a relative of one of the crew members, Scott Althaus, researched the crash site. Navy divers recovered dog tags and other personal items, leading to the identification of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick.</p>

The Dodgers are encouraging Scott to focus on missing bats and potentially walking more batters to regain control, especially with several key relievers currently injured.

The activity, which lasted for several hours, included lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet and an eruptive plume extending at least 5,000 feet. While lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera and did not affect residential areas, authorities warned of potential hazards from ash and volcanic fragments carried by the wind. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has been emitting lava fountains frequently since December 2024, drawing tourists to witness the spectacle.</p>
