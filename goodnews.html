        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Beckham and Gary Neville have completed a takeover of Salford City, acquiring the remaining shares from their Class of '92 teammates. Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, and Phil Neville are no longer shareholders but will maintain roles in technical, football, commercial, recruitment, and foundation aspects of the club. Beckham expressed pride in joining Neville in this new chapter for Salford, which achieved four promotions in five seasons after the Class of '92's initial involvement in 2014, though they missed the League Two play-offs this past season by a single point. The new ownership group also includes former banker Lord Mervyn Davies and businessman Declan Kelly, signaling a broader investment and management structure for the club's future.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since the implementation of new tariffs. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports but adjusts tariffs on UK autos, allowing the first 100,000 vehicles to be imported at a 10% rate, with higher rates thereafter. The deal aims to create a $5 billion export opportunity for U.S. farmers and streamline customs procedures. While the UK Prime Minister hailed the deal, some experts caution that this approach may not be easily replicable with countries having larger trade surpluses with the U.S. The article notes that UK duties on U.S. goods are expected to decrease from 5.1% to 1.8%.</p>

The $4,200 charge initially put Ms. LaFavers' bank account in the red, but after local and national media attention, Amazon refunded the purchase. Instead of selling the lollipops, Ms. LaFavers decided to donate them to local charities, schools, and churches, with the candy company even inviting Liam and his mother to visit their factory. The article highlights the need for parental controls on online shopping sites, as other parents shared similar stories of children making unauthorized purchases.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to overhaul the air traffic control system following a recent communications outage at Newark Liberty International Airport.

          <p>The US and UK have reached a tariff agreement reducing or removing tariffs on specific goods traded between the countries, but President Trump's 10% tariffs on imports remains in place.

Agreement on pharmaceuticals is still unknown, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms, though the UK and US have agreed to work on a digital trade deal.

          <p>A Lords committee heard that home working has led to a decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London, as spending data suggests that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday. A similar shift is not seen in other large British cities, where spending in bars is more likely to shift into the weekend. The data analyzed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialize than in the capital.</p>
