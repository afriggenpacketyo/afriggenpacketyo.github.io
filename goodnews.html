          <p>Mid-Oktoberfest, safety concerns have emerged following an overcrowding incident that led to the temporary closure of festival entrances and mass confusion. An estimated 300,000 visitors were on the grounds, causing bottlenecks and leading to panic attacks for two individuals, though no injuries were reported. The surge was attributed to simultaneous tent shifts. Despite the overcrowding, overall visitor numbers and beer consumption are slightly down compared to last year, while non-alcoholic beverage sales, especially water, have increased due to warm weather. Organizers are working to manage crowd control more effectively.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK following an international fraud investigation that led to the seizure of 61,000 bitcoin, valued at over £5bn. Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency, which was stolen from over 128,000 victims in China between 2014 and 2017. She attempted to launder the funds by buying property in the UK after fleeing China. Her solicitor stated she hopes the plea brings comfort to investors, with sufficient funds now available to repay their losses due to the rise in cryptocurrency values.</p>

          <p>Lady Gaga launched her "Mayhem Ball" UK tour, a magnificent and operatic show that blends gothic spectacle with a personal narrative of fighting inner demons and reckoning with her past. The concert, featuring two decades of hits and guest appearances, explores themes of sacrificing privacy and health for her career. Gaga's powerful vocals and kinetic choreography are set against a gothic musical overhaul, culminating in a cathartic performance of "Bad Romance" after she symbolically defeats the "mistress of mayhem." Fans were treated to impromptu songs, reflecting a deeply personal and triumphant return to high-concept pop.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has launched DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, an experimental AI model aiming to boost efficiency and handle large information volumes at reduced costs. The model introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which selectively processes important data, potentially halving operational costs compared to its predecessor. While this innovation promises greater accessibility for developers and smaller companies, concerns exist regarding potential reliability drops due to the selective data processing. DeepSeek's focus on efficiency and open-source sharing, alongside its compatibility with Chinese-made AI chips, positions it as a significant player in the global AI competition.</p>

          <p>Jian Guo, a former aide to German far-right AfD politician Maximilian Krah, has been sentenced to four years and nine months in jail for spying for China. Guo, a German national, was convicted in Dresden for gathering information and passing confidential documents to Chinese authorities during his time in Krah's European Parliament office. He was also accused of spying on Chinese dissidents in Germany. The case has intensified concerns about China's intelligence activities within the European Union, with the court deeming it a particularly serious offense.</p>

          <h2>US EV Sales Surge Ahead of Federal Tax Credit Expiration Deadline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US electric vehicle (EV) sales have surged dramatically ahead of the September 30 federal tax credit deadline, which offers up to $7,500 for new EVs. This incentive created a rush among buyers, boosting third-quarter EV sales by over 21% compared to last year. While the immediate effect is a strong auto market, analysts predict an "EV hangover" in subsequent months as demand temporarily wanes. Automakers are now anticipating what "natural demand" will look like without the tax credits, as policy changes are expected to slow future EV sales growth despite continued investment in the sector.

          <p>As sports betting explodes across the US, a debate is intensifying over whether states should implement more limits to combat gambling addiction. Massachusetts, with its "GameSense" program, exemplifies state efforts to promote moderation through spending limits and self-exclusion lists, funded by a surtax on industry profits. Addiction researchers advocate for bolder, unified national policies, citing stricter regulations in countries like Norway and the UK. Proposed federal legislation, the SAFE Bet Act, aims to impose standards like advertising bans and affordability checks, but faces strong opposition from the gambling industry, which prefers its "responsible gaming" initiatives.</p>

          <p>Facing uncertain US military assistance, Ukraine is rapidly expanding its domestic arms industry, particularly in drone manufacturing, now dubbed the "defense valley of the world." The country, which produced over 2 million drones last year, expects to make 4 million this year, with many costing $1,000 or less for single-use strikes. While still reliant on the US for advanced systems like Patriot and F-16s, Ukraine is developing its own powerful cruise missiles like the Flamingo. This strategic shift is driven by necessity, aiming to compensate for numerical disadvantages and position Ukraine as a promising defense partner.</p>

It delves into Ali's public taunts of Frazier and Frazier's lasting resentment, portraying the fight as a test of human endurance that neither man fully recovered from.
