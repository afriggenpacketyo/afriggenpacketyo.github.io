          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. In a social media post, Trump stated that during this period, efforts would be made with all parties to bring an end to the war. He urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which he said was brokered with help from Qatar and Egypt, warning that the terms would only worsen for them. The conflict, which began after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, has resulted in significant casualties on both sides.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering (IPO), planning to trade on the NYSE under the symbol "FIG." The move comes after a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory issues, resulting in a $1 billion termination fee for Figma. The company has shown strong growth, with first-quarter revenue up 46% to $228.2 million and a growing base of high-value customers. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public aims to allow the community to share in Figma's ownership and signals the company will "take big swings," including further acquisitions.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer noted that Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia were the standout performers of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, ending the first half of 2025 at all-time highs. He attributes Microsoft's success to better-than-expected growth in its Azure cloud business. Nvidia's triumph is credited to its continued dominance in the AI chip sector and persistent high demand, despite earlier concerns about competition and U.S. sales restrictions in China. Cramer suggests Meta's strong performance is due to its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to quarterly earnings that significantly surpassed estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York City jury has ordered the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to pay $22.75 million to a man who lost five toes after falling onto subway tracks from a damaged platform in 2017. Maruf Hossain, a deliveryman, tripped on a chipped platform at a Bronx station and was struck by an incoming train, also suffering a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. His lawyer argued the MTA was negligent and tried to "bully" Hossain into a small settlement, while the MTA contended he had attempted suicide. The jury's award exceeded the $20 million sought in the original lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an ¬£8.4 million fee to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold a month before he became a free agent has already proven financially astute. The club wanted him in time for the Club World Cup, and his performance has been pivotal. An assist from Alexander-Arnold for a goal by 21-year-old striker Gonzalo Garcia secured their advancement to the quarter-finals, earning the club an extra ¬£10 million in prize money. While questions about his defensive skills remain, his attacking contributions and adaptation to the team's new formation are showing promising signs for his career in Madrid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in an effort to boost housing construction. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. This change aims to eliminate lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits that have historically delayed or blocked new developments. While other obstacles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the reform removes a key tool that groups have used for decades to stall housing projects, signaling a major policy shift.</p>

Zverev's exit marks him as the fourth top-10 men's player to be eliminated in the early days of the tournament.</p>

          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has been officially ranked No. 14 in the World Boxing Association's cruiserweight division, making him eligible to challenge for a world title. The ranking came just two days after his victory over veteran boxer Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. This development positions him for a potential bout against the current WBA champion, Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ram√≠rez. While a milestone for the social media star, the WBA's decision is seen by some as reflecting Paul's immense financial drawing power more than his traditional boxing credentials, which include fights against non-boxers and a single loss to Tommy Fury.</p>

          <p>A person walking on a beach in Walton County, Florida, discovered 25 kilos of cocaine, with an estimated street value of nearly half a million dollars, that had washed ashore. The drugs were found wrapped in distinctive packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The Walton County Sheriff's Office confiscated the narcotics and warned the public not to touch any suspicious packages found on the beach, as their contents could be dangerous. This incident is the latest in a series of discoveries where large quantities of illicit drugs, often in unique packaging, have washed up on Florida's coasts.</p>
