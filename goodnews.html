          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a looming deadline for increased tariffs. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by the U.S. but higher than the EU had hoped for. As part of the accord, the EU has also committed to significant new investments in the U.S. and large purchases of American energy. European leaders expressed that the agreement brings stability and predictability to the transatlantic trade relationship, though some acknowledged it will still make trade more challenging.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has downplayed any speculation about his own potential 2028 presidential candidacy, instead offering his endorsement for Vice President JD Vance. In a recent interview, Rubio described Vance as a close friend and stated he would be a "great nominee" for the Republican Party if he chose to run. Rubio emphasized his satisfaction with his current role as the nation's top diplomat in President Trump's Cabinet. He conveyed that he would be content with his public service if he could continue making a difference in his current position for the remainder of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Following the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 victory, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to declare a national bank holiday to celebrate the achievement. The decision aligns with the precedent set after the team's previous Euro win in 2022 and the men's World Cup victory in 1966. While a homecoming parade is scheduled in London, the government appears to be foregoing a day off, likely considering the economic cost. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported such a holiday, praised the "history makers" for their dramatic penalty shootout win against Spain.</p>

          <p>An analysis of England cricketer Ben Stokes' recent performance suggests that the all-rounder must learn to manage his own physical limits, as it is clear no one else can tell him to stop. Despite being hampered by injuries, Stokes has been a standout bowler for England, but his continued exertion raises concerns about his long-term fitness. The article argues that England's chances in crucial upcoming series, like the Ashes, are massively diminished without a fully fit Stokes. His importance is both a compliment to his world-class skill and a concern about the team's over-reliance on him.</p>
