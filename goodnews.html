          <p>After a 16-year hiatus marked by a public feud, Britpop band Oasis reunited for the first show of their new tour in Cardiff, Wales. Brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher performed a two-hour set of their 1990s hits to an ecstatic crowd of over 60,000. While maintaining some distance on stage, the performance was powerful and well-received, featuring classics like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." The tour has generated immense fan excitement and significant controversy over ticket pricing practices.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the nation's highest civilian honor, during a two-day diplomatic visit. This marks the first time a foreign leader has received the award, symbolizing the deep historical ties between the two countries, which date back to the 19th-century arrival of indentured Indian laborers. The visit focused on strengthening strategic partnerships and boosting investment in sectors like energy and health. Modi also announced expanded eligibility for Overseas Citizen of India cards for Trinidadians of Indian descent.</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears of a season-ending injury, Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was diagnosed with a bone bruise in his knee and is expected to miss about six weeks. The positive prognosis means he should return with more than a month remaining before the playoffs. As a result, the team's general manager, Brandon Gomes, has indicated that their trade deadline plans will not be significantly altered. The Dodgers intend to rely on internal options to cover the position while awaiting Muncy's recovery later in the season.</p>

          <p>Several sharks spotted swimming dangerously close to beachgoers on the Fourth of July led to temporary beach closures in the Rockaways area of Queens, New York. Officials used drone technology to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety, with one beach being closed for an hour before reopening. The sightings come after New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced increased shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend. Authorities are continuing to monitor the situation to keep swimmers safe.</p>

          <p>Artisans in Kolhapur, India, are accusing Italian luxury brand Prada of cultural appropriation after it released a line of footwear closely resembling traditional, handcrafted Kolhapuri sandals without acknowledging their origin. The local artisans, many of whom are from marginalized communities and earn very little, were angered by the lack of recognition for a craft with centuries of history. Following a social media backlash, Prada acknowledged the sandals' roots, and now local associations are seeking better protection and potential compensation for the craft's cultural legacy, even as the controversy has boosted demand for the authentic design.</p>

          <p>The emotional appearance of a UK politician has sparked a broader conversation about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. While some still view it as a sign of weakness or unprofessionalism, particularly for leaders, many experts and workers argue it reflects emotional intelligence and authenticity. Executive coaches suggest that in modern workplaces, showing vulnerability can be a strength, fostering a more compassionate and supportive environment. However, some acknowledge a lingering bias that could affect promotion prospects, emphasizing that context and how one recovers from the emotional moment are key.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in combating global warming. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to hibernate. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere. This "seasonal vertical migration pump" is a far more significant climate-regulating mechanism than previously understood, underscoring the importance of these overlooked organisms.</p>

Zoo experts entrusted the pair with one of two eggs laid by another couple to improve the survival chances for both chicks. This marks a "bumper year" for the vulnerable species at the zoo, with a total of 10 new chicks born. Same-sex penguin parenting, while not common, has been observed in other zoos, with both parents sharing incubation and feeding duties for their young.</p>
