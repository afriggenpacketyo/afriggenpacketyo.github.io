          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Following his win, moderate Democrats and business leaders began strategizing to oppose him in the general election, with some considering backing an independent candidate to challenge his platform. Despite this opposition, Mamdani has received endorsements from prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and Rep. Jerry Nadler, signaling a complex and divided political landscape. Mamdani's campaign is actively engaging with all factions, including the business community, aiming to build a broad coalition for the November election.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas residing at the Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have departed for China, leaving only two pandas in the entire country. The departure of Rauhin and her three offspring marks a significant moment for the zoo, which has been part of a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994. Hundreds of visitors and staff attended a farewell ceremony for the animals, who are heading to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida indicates that body fat percentage is a far more accurate predictor of mortality risk than the commonly used Body Mass Index (BMI). Researchers found that individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die over a 15-year period compared to those with healthy levels. The study suggests that BMI is an unreliable metric because it cannot distinguish between fat and muscle mass. Experts propose that more accessible methods for measuring body fat, like bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), could become a more effective standard of care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent opinion piece, a columnist examines President Trump's public use of an expletive when discussing the long-standing conflict between Israel and Iran. The author argues that while unprecedented for a president in such a forum, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many people. The article suggests that in an era of scripted political speech, such moments of unguarded language can make politicians seem more human and relatable to the public. However, the author also notes that the profanity does not absolve the president of his own role in the complex geopolitical situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration experienced a momentous week, securing several victories while facing unresolved challenges that could define his presidency. Key wins included a Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions against executive actions and progress on NATO defense spending commitments. However, major trade deals remain unfinished ahead of a July deadline, and the passage of his "one big beautiful bill" combining tax cuts and policy priorities is still uncertain in the Senate. This confluence of high-stakes events at home and abroad has created a pressure-filled environment with significant long-term implications.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is increasingly turning to interceptor drones as a crucial and cost-effective strategy to counter the escalating number of Russian drone attacks. With Russia deploying modernized Shahed drones that fly at higher altitudes, traditional mobile air defense has become less effective. In response, Ukraine is ramping up the mass production of specialized, high-speed interceptor drones, which are significantly cheaper than anti-aircraft missiles. This strategic shift aims to protect the country's infrastructure and defense systems more efficiently, with President Zelenskyy highlighting it as a national priority.</p>

          <p>In response to growing social tensions, China has expanded its social security safeguards for populations affected by flood diversion schemes during extreme weather. Under the revised rules, the central government will now cover 70% of compensation funds for economic losses in designated flood storage areas. For the first time, the policy also includes payments for livestock and poultry that cannot be relocated in time. This change comes after nearly a million people were relocated in Hebei province in 2023, sacrificing homes and farms to protect Beijing from record rainfall.</p>
