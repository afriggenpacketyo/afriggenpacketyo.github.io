          <p>Roki Sasaki, the highly anticipated Los Angeles Dodgers rookie, achieved his first Major League Baseball win after a shaky start, allowing three runs over five innings in a 10-3 victory against the Atlanta Braves. Japanese teammate Shohei Ohtani contributed significantly with a solo home run in the third inning, marking his eighth of the season, and went 3-for-4 with an RBI.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. This move fulfills a long-standing promise by Republicans to promote school choice, despite opposition from Democrats and rural Republicans. The program will provide families with $10,000 per year, and children with disabilities can qualify for up to $30,000 annually. Critics argue that the program will divert resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families, while supporters claim it will expand educational opportunities for students in struggling schools.</p>

While some parties support the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, fearing it would impact traditional family values.</p>
