          <h2>Federal Judge Deems Trump's Executive Order Targeting Law Firm Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 19:52:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing clients disliked by the president, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The judge emphasized that using government power to target lawyers for their representation of clients is contrary to the Constitution, referencing the firm's work with Hillary Clinton and its ties to the Steele Dossier, while noting the coercive power of such targeting by the Trump administration. Howell's ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions.</p>

          <p>A military parade honoring the US Army's 250th anniversary will be held on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The event will feature 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, and 50 aircraft on the National Mall in Washington DC. Trump had previously proposed a military parade, but the idea was scrapped due to high costs. In addition to the parade, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II", though it is unclear whether he intends for 8 May to become a federal holiday, which would require Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election, with President Trump's influence playing a significant role. The center-right Liberal-National Coalition's support has declined since Trump took office, trailing the Labor Party. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign echoes Trump's messaging, focusing on the economy. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Trump, avoiding direct criticism, while Australia is a key partner in the AUKUS security partnership, requiring it to show the Trump administration it is a responsible ally in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was interrupted at a town hall event by a protester yelling about the "genocide" in Gaza. The protester accused Ocasio-Cortez of being a "war criminal" before being escorted out of the event. Ocasio-Cortez responded by stating that she welcomes disagreements but asked attendees to wait for the Q&A session to allow everyone to have a chance to speak. The congresswoman recently raised a massive $9.6 million, one of the biggest fundraising hauls ever for a House lawmaker.</p>

          <p>Leah T. Wilson, the executive director of the State Bar of California, will step down in July after facing pressure to resign due to the botched February roll out of a new bar exam. The exam was plagued by technical glitches and irregularities, and the State Bar was criticized for its lack of transparency regarding the use of artificial intelligence in developing multiple-choice questions. Wilson apologized for the issues, and her last day will be July 7. She maintains that California should ultimately push ahead with its own bar exam.</p>
