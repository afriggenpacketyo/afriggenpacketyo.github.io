          <p>President Trump held a dinner at the White House for prominent leaders in the technology and business sectors, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates. The event was intended to foster ties between the administration and Silicon Valley, with discussions touching on topics like vaccine technology and U.S. manufacturing investments. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was notably absent despite being invited, citing a prior commitment, which comes after a public falling-out with the president earlier in the year. The administration has been actively encouraging tech companies to increase their domestic presence.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Hunan province are considering a new application for the country's central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, to resolve long-standing payment defaults. The plan aims to use the digital yuan to create a more transparent and traceable system for clearing interconnected, or 'chain', debts. This would allow funds to be directed to the final recipient in a payment chain, potentially increasing efficiency and control over transactions. Analysts suggest this initiative could broaden the digital currency's use beyond its current retail applications and enhance visibility within the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The London City Lionesses have agreed to a world-record £1.4 million transfer fee to sign French international midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain. This landmark deal surpasses the previous record and signals the high ambitions of the Women's Super League newcomers, who are backed by wealthy American owner Michele Kang. Geyoro, a highly-regarded player with extensive Champions League experience, is one of several high-profile signings for the club this summer. The move highlights a significant investment in the team as it aims to disrupt the established order in English women's football.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a notable jump of 1.39% following the news, with other regional markets also posting gains.

          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly prevalent in American culture, with a third of adults now having at least one, according to the Pew Research Center. This shift reflects a greater emphasis on individuality and self-expression, with many artists and enthusiasts viewing tattoos as a legitimate art form. Despite their growing popularity, particularly among millennials, some societal stigma remains, as studies show people with tattoos may be less likely to be hired or trusted. However, art institutions are beginning to recognize the medium, with exhibits like one at the Flint Institute of Arts showcasing the work of tattoo artists.</p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is seeing beneficial results from its 'Disconnect to Reconnect' program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. At Lakeside High School in DeKalb County, teachers report that the policy has created a better learning environment by reducing distractions and increasing student engagement. The principal noted a significant decrease in student conduct issues since the pilot program was introduced. This local initiative is part of a broader national trend, with over half of U.S. states now having laws that regulate or ban cellphone use in schools.</p>

This discovery, now part of the V&A Museum's collection, sheds light on one of Bowie's lifelong ambitions to write for the theater.

The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release, stating it is their duty to correct mistakes and hold the right individuals responsible.

Arora predicted that enterprises will not allow such browsers within the next two years unless they are designed with enterprise-grade credential management and security.
