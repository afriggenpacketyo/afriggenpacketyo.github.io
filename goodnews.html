          <p>President Trump has issued a directive to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they take significant steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. In letters sent to firms like Pfizer, Merck, and Eli Lilly, he threatened to use every available tool to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices." The administration is pushing for companies to adopt a "most favored nation" policy, aligning U.S. prices with the lowest costs in other developed countries. This move caused shares of several major drugmakers to fall significantly following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

Figma, which makes web-based collaborative design tools, saw its valuation surge to nearly $68 billion by the end of its first trading day. The strong performance follows a previously abandoned $20 billion acquisition deal with Adobe, which faced regulatory opposition in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, posting its largest quarterly revenue growth since December 2021 with a 10% overall increase. The company's success was largely driven by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales, with CEO Tim Cook highlighting the popularity of the iPhone 16 model. Mac sales also grew significantly, while the services division continued its steady expansion. However, sales for the iPad and the wearables division, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, both experienced a decline during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent meeting in France between LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter, and Nikola Jokić’s agent has fueled reports of plans for a new $5 billion international basketball league. The proposed venture, inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, would feature touring men's and women's teams and offer players equity stakes, a practice currently prohibited in the NBA. This development comes as the NBA pursues its own expansion into Europe, creating potential competition. The new league would likely require full-time commitments, preventing players from participating in the NBA simultaneously.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the presidential fitness test, a physical assessment program for schoolchildren that was discontinued 12 years ago. The original program, which existed for decades, focused on competitive activities like one-mile runs and push-ups, while its replacement emphasized healthier lifestyles over specific performance metrics. The administration, framing the move as part of its "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, will also re-establish the president’s council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to administer the revived program.</p>

          <p>A line of collectible monster dolls named Labubu has become a viral fashion accessory in the United States, significantly driving up business for its Chinese parent company, Pop Mart. The plush creatures, often seen hanging from purses and belt loops, have fueled a more than 550% revenue surge for Pop Mart in North America between 2023 and 2024. Analysts describe the dolls as a "gateway drug" to the company's broader range of products, with their popularity boosted by celebrities and social media trends. This has helped Pop Mart's stock soar and shifted its consumer base internationally.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a process of ancient interbreeding. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences solved this long-standing botanical mystery by analyzing hundreds of genomes from both cultivated and wild potato species. They discovered that a hybridization event combined a crucial gene from an ancient tomato, which instructs the plant to form tubers, with a gene from a wild potato relative that controls their growth. This genetic combination was essential for creating the modern starchy vegetable.</p>
