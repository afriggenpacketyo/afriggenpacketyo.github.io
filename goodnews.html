          <p>An international peace summit aimed at ending the war in Gaza is scheduled to take place in Egypt, co-chaired by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and U.S. President Donald Trump. The summit follows an agreement for Hamas to release hostages, with families being notified that the process will begin Monday morning. In Tel Aviv, Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner addressed a rally, conveying a message of support ahead of the expected release, while the death toll in Gaza continues to rise.</p>

          <p>As a peace summit in Egypt approaches, Israel's defense minister has announced plans to destroy all of Hamas's underground tunnels in Gaza once the agreed-upon hostage release is complete. The operation is set to be conducted by the Israeli military under US supervision. This development comes as Hamas is expected to begin releasing hostages on Monday, a key part of the ceasefire agreement brokered with the help of the United States. The summit aims to formalize the peace plan with over 20 world leaders in attendance.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to identify complex structural similarities in proteins from unrelated species that have independently evolved similar traits. This approach moves beyond traditional methods that focus on simple sequence similarities, allowing for a deeper understanding of the genetic basis for convergent evolution. The study's findings highlight an underappreciated sequence basis for how different species, like bats and dolphins with echolocation, develop the same functional abilities through separate evolutionary paths.</p>

          <p>A review of current money market account rates indicates that while the national average is low at 0.59%, some high-yield accounts are offering rates of 4% APY or higher. Following recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, deposit rates have begun to fall, making it increasingly important for savers to compare options to maximize their earnings. The article illustrates how choosing an account with a higher APY can significantly increase the interest earned on deposits over the course of a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preparations are underway to significantly increase humanitarian aid entering Gaza, with up to 600 trucks expected daily under a new ceasefire agreement. The deal also includes the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to visit Israel and attend a peace summit in Egypt. As displaced Palestinians begin returning to devastated areas, the fate of the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which had replaced UN operations, remains uncertain after its distribution sites were dismantled.</p>

          <p>Despite having access to elite coaching staff at their clubs, a growing number of top footballers, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, are hiring private coaches. These external sessions allow players to focus on specific, fine-tuned details of their game that may be overlooked in a group setting. While some clubs are wary of the injury risks, others collaborate with private coaches, recognizing the potential for confidence-building and performance enhancement. The trend highlights players' dedication to gaining any possible advantage in a highly competitive sport.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. The line will traverse extreme terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost, with an estimated cost of up to 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion). This 'project of the century' is seen as crucial for Beijing to enhance economic integration, resource transport, and strategic control over these two vast autonomous regions. The engineering difficulties and massive investment underscore the project's national significance.</p>

          <p>The European Union has begun a gradual six-month rollout of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system requires travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, on their first use. While EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel by eventually replacing passport stamps, there are concerns that the initial registration process could cause significant delays at ports, airports, and rail terminals.</p>

          <p>At its party conference, Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has committed to creating a detailed plan for Welsh independence, though it will not be a priority within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth proposed establishing a 'standing commission' to engage the public and prepare a white paper on the path to independence. This marks a shift from the party's previous pledge to hold an independence referendum within five years, signaling a more gradual, long-term approach to achieving its ultimate constitutional goal.</p>

          <p>An agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the right for Muslim students and employees to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has sparked a public debate. While some media outlets misleadingly framed it as 'extra holidays,' legal experts clarify that the regulation simply affirms a long-standing practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to provisions for other non-Christian faiths. The discussion reflects Germany's broader conversation about integration, equality, and the recognition of religious diversity within its state-regulated holiday system.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a new plant. Their research, published in the journal 'Cell', identifies two key genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state. This process, known as somatic embryogenesis, was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The breakthrough provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant science.</p>
