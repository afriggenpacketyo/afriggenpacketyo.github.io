          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes declined a substantial offer from Al-Hilal, a Saudi Pro-League club, which would have more than doubled his current salary. After discussing the proposal with his family, Fernandes decided to remain with Manchester United, where he is already a top earner. United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, had previously expressed confidence that Fernandes would stay at Old Trafford. Fernandes has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals for the club since joining in January 2020. The club is reportedly pleased with Fernandes' decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is implementing performance metrics for American ambassadors in Africa, evaluating them based on the number of business deals they facilitate. This shift reflects the U.S. government's new "trade, not aid" approach to the continent. President Trump's second administration secured 33 deals worth $6 billion in its first 100 days, according to Troy Fitrell, a senior U.S. official for the Bureau of African Affairs. This commercial diplomacy strategy focuses on countries where U.S. companies are interested in doing business, aiming to reshape economic ties with Africa in competition with China.</p>

The AirCar transforms from a road-legal sports coupe into an aircraft in about 80 seconds, requiring no manual adjustments. It will offer three engine options, with the top version reaching speeds of 124 mph on the road and cruising at 155 mph in the air, with a range of 620 miles. Expected to cost between $800,000 and $1.2 million, it is aimed at wealthy business travelers and air taxi operators, requiring both a driver's license and a pilot's license to operate.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda stated that many market participants view continued reductions in government bond purchases as appropriate, as the central bank normalizes policy after a decade of easing. He noted limited calls to revise the current reduction plan through March 2026 during a mid-May meeting with market participants. Ueda also mentioned that the BOJ will not push to raise its policy rate unless economic and price conditions improve, citing uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. The BOJ will discuss guidelines for government bond purchases from April, taking into account market participant opinions.</p>

          <p>Jodie Marsh has won her legal battle against Uttlesford District Council, allowing her to keep lemurs at her private animal sanctuary. The council had refused her application for a wild animal license, raising concerns about her taking a meerkat to a pub. Judge Christopher Williams ruled in Marsh's favor, ordering the council to pay her ¬£19,641 in costs, citing a lack of evidence of animal mismanagement. The judge criticized the council for contradictory views and going against reports stating Marsh was a suitable keeper.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation dropped to 1.9% in May, falling below the European Central Bank's (ECB) 2% target, driven by sharp declines in services. The closely watched services inflation cooled significantly to 3.2%, and core inflation also eased to 2.3%. This data strengthens the case for another interest rate cut at the ECB's next meeting in July, despite uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The OECD expects the euro area to expand by 1% in 2025, with inflation projected at 2.2%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men believed the line was illegal and reported it to state wildlife officials after freeing the animals in August 2020. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms, and traveling freely. Attorneys for Mansell and Moore expressed relief, stating the case should never have been filed and praising their clients' intentions to save the sharks.</p>

          <p>The House v. NCAA settlement, awaiting court approval, proposes a revenue-sharing model between schools and athletes, potentially reshaping college athletics. The settlement stems from merging three lawsuits alleging the NCAA violated antitrust laws by restricting athletes' NIL rights. If approved, $2.8 billion would be provided to athletes who couldn't profit off their NIL between 2016 and Sept. 15, 2024, with revenue sharing starting July 1, capped at $20.5 million per school for 2025-26. The agreement includes roster caps, causing delays due to objections, with universities preparing for both approval and denial scenarios.</p>
