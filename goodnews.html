          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the pioneering primatologist and world-leading chimpanzee expert, has died at 91, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy. Her groundbreaking observations, including the discovery of tool use by chimpanzees, revolutionized scientific understanding of our closest primate cousins and challenged conventional thinking about animal intelligence. Goodall dedicated her life to conservation, tirelessly advocating for the protection and restoration of the natural world through her Jane Goodall Institute, which she founded in 1977. Tributes have poured in globally from figures like Barack Obama and Greenpeace, recognizing her profound impact on science and inspiring a global movement for a better planet. She received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025, underscoring her monumental contributions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adapting to significantly higher gold prices, driven by persistent demand for wedding jewelry despite global market surges. Gold prices have climbed over 48% this year, reaching a record high of US$3,883 per ounce, following a substantial 26% increase last year, which was the biggest annual gain in 14 years. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook observe that consumers have gradually accepted this new price level since March, indicating a cultural resilience in purchasing habits. This ongoing trend highlights the deep-rooted importance of gold in Chinese wedding customs, even as economic factors push valuations to unprecedented levels. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 3% to an all-time high, propelled by significant gains in heavyweight Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. This market uplift follows the announcement of a strategic partnership between the two chipmakers and OpenAI, aimed at supplying advanced memory chips essential for next-generation AI. While these companies saw substantial stock increases, the broader Asian market experienced mixed results, with Japan and Australia advancing, though Chinese and Indian markets were closed for holidays. The overall market optimism, including fresh highs for the S&P 500, is partly fueled by investor bets that the ongoing U.S. government shutdown will be short-lived, despite some predictions of a longer impasse.

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as an antagonist in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a car wash confrontation last month. The Los Angeles city attorney's office declined to file charges, though the specific reason for this decision was not provided. Cruz had been held in police custody for five hours after three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water while he washed his car. His agent maintained that the women had parked too close, refused requests to move, and began recording Cruz, suggesting any water splash was unintentional during his attempt to communicate with them.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix surged significantly, with SK Hynix reaching a 25-year high and Samsung its highest since 2021, following their partnership announcement with OpenAI. This collaboration is part of OpenAI's "Stargate" initiative, focusing on increasing the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI and expanding data center capacity in Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and top executives to solidify these agreements, which also include exploring next-generation AI data centers. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia and a leader in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) production, is poised for further growth, while Samsung aims to strengthen its position in the competitive HBM space.

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a 133-year-old brand, launched a viral marketing campaign rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously address the severe US housing affordability crisis. The ad campaign, featuring the slogan "Maxwell House? In this economy?", highlights the increasing difficulty for first-time homebuyers, whose median age has risen to an all-time high of 38. With fewer than 16% of homes affordable for typical households in 2023, this "tongue-in-cheek" effort aims to strengthen the brand's connection with coffee-loving renters, a growing population across the country. The campaign offers a year's supply of coffee for "under $40," further emphasizing affordability in challenging economic times.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first person to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, briefly reaching $500.1 billion before a slight dip. This monumental milestone is attributed to the surging valuations of his various ventures, including electric car company Tesla, artificial intelligence startup xAI, and rocket company SpaceX. Musk's immense wealth is closely tied to his over 12% stake in Tesla, which has seen its shares rise sharply this year, partly due to investors welcoming his increased focus on his companies. He remains significantly ahead of other global tech rivals, such as Oracle founder Larry Ellison, further solidifying his position as the world's richest individual. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi has largely reduced its exposure to China's September equity rally, reallocating holdings to dividend stocks due to ongoing doubts about the country's economic outlook. The firm trimmed positions in "overvalued" Chinese stocks while selectively increasing exposure to onshore shares over Hong Kong-listed equities, noting their valuation gap. Philippe d’Orgeval, Amundi’s deputy group chief investment officer, cited macro concerns and unsettled tariffs as factors, suggesting a less supportive environment for equity markets. This strategic shift reflects broader market skepticism about the sustainability of China's rebound, as concerns persist that the rally, driven by AI enthusiasm, may have run ahead of underlying economic fundamentals.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order pledging to use all lawful measures, including US military action, to defend the energy-rich nation of Qatar against external attack. The order, citing close cooperation and shared interests, designates any armed attack on Qatar's territory, sovereignty, or critical infrastructure as a threat to US peace and security. This significant move follows Israel's surprise attack on Qatar, targeting Hamas leaders, for which Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed deep regret during a call organized by Trump. The pledge's true legal weight remains uncertain, as such agreements typically require Senate approval, though presidents have historically entered international agreements without it. Qatar hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East, underscoring its strategic importance.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has blocked the federal government from diverting $34 million in anti-terrorism funding for New York City's transit system, citing the city's unique vulnerability to attacks.

The state's lawsuit highlighted the Rail and Transit Security Grant Program's creation post-9/11 to protect against various threats, emphasizing New York's history of terrorist incidents. This ruling temporarily protects crucial security resources, which the NYPD commissioner warned were vital for preventing future attacks and ensuring public safety.</p>

When questioned by reporters about not moving up the depth chart, Sanders literally muted himself, moving his mouth and gesturing without producing any sound, a creative way to avoid responding. This comes after Sanders, a former college star and son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, dropped to the fifth round of the draft despite earlier projections. His silent response may be a reaction to critical remarks from analyst Rex Ryan regarding Sanders' previous comments about his NFL playing capability compared to other league quarterbacks.</p>

          <p>Understanding cooking oils is crucial for health, as different fats impact cholesterol levels, with some raising and others lowering "bad" cholesterol. Professor Nita Forouhi debunks common myths, asserting that rapeseed and sunflower oils are "absolutely good for us," being low in saturated fats and high in healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, which can reduce disease risk. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, containing minimal trans fats, unlike their predecessors. While extra virgin olive oil is best for salad dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying. For deep frying, vegetable or sunflower oil is recommended for their ability to withstand higher temperatures without breaking down.</p>
