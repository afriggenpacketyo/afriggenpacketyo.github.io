          <p>President Trump has finalized an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to establish a 10-mile artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi, which will be the largest such project outside the United States. The campus will be powered by 5 gigawatts of electrical power and supplied with American-made A.I. chips, fostering collaboration between U.S. and Emirati companies. While some experts express concerns about potential risks due to the U.A.E.'s authoritarian government and ties to China, the Commerce Department asserts the U.A.E. is committed to safeguarding advanced A.I. technologies.

          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava reported better-than-expected sales in its latest fiscal quarter, driven by a 10.8% increase in same-store sales. This growth is attributed to increased traffic and higher spending on premium items. While other restaurants report cautious consumer behavior, Cava is seeing diners trade up from fast food and down from casual dining. Despite the positive results, Cava reiterated its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the year, leading to a slight dip in stock value after hours. </p>

          <p>Canada has emerged as a global leader in digital assets due to its early adoption of crypto regulations, starting with anti-money laundering guidelines in 2014. This regulatory clarity has made Toronto a hub for blockchain growth, attracting attention from Wall Street. Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi, along with other companies seeking U.S. listings after starting on the Toronto Stock Exchange, highlights Canada's appeal. JPMorgan, Ondo, and Chainlink recently announced a $100 billion blockchain initiative in Toronto, further solidifying Canada's position in the crypto space. </p>

The visit underscores the close ties between Trump and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, built in part on the UAE's decision to normalize relations with Israel.

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey warned investors that the retailer will have to raise prices on many items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The company will absorb some costs but expects shoppers to see increases by the end of May and more in June. Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia have put pressure on the price of imported items, including bananas, avocados, coffee and roses.
