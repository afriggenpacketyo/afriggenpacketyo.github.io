          <p>Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air have successfully restored flight operations across their network after a significant IT outage caused a nationwide ground stop, leading to the cancellation of over 360 flights. The Seattle-based carrier confirmed the lifting of the ground stop, but advised passengers to anticipate further disruptions as aircraft and crews are being strategically repositioned. A flexible travel policy has been implemented to support guests whose plans were affected. The airline has not yet provided specific details regarding the nature of the technical issue that prompted the widespread disruption.</p>

          <p>Debt collectors typically consider filing lawsuits for unpaid amounts ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, although there is no universal minimum threshold, as the decision depends on factors like debt size, type, and state laws. With Americans facing record credit card debt, many are at risk of legal action, which can have lasting financial consequences. The article advises proactive measures to avoid court, including direct communication with creditors, exploring debt management programs, considering debt settlement, or pursuing debt consolidation loans to resolve outstanding balances.

          <p>The New York Knicks have sent a cease-and-desist letter to mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani after he used a logo strikingly similar to the team’s in a campaign advertisement. The Knicks unequivocally stated they do not endorse Mamdani for Mayor and object to the unauthorized use of their copyrighted logo, vowing to pursue all available legal remedies to protect their rights. Mamdani's Instagram post, which featured the logo and the caption "#NewYorkForever" with a Madison Square Garden location, has since been removed.</p>

The primary suspect, a 77-year-old German man, allegedly attempted to market 20 fake paintings, including a copy of Rembrandt's famous "De Staalmeesters" for an astonishing 120 million Swiss francs. Raids led to two arrests and the confiscation of all suspected artworks, which are now undergoing detailed examination by experts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned federal law enforcement surge into San Francisco, attributing the decision to Mayor Daniel Lurie's "very nicely" worded request for an opportunity to address the city's challenges independently. Trump also cited positive endorsements from influential Silicon Valley leaders, including Marc Benioff and Jensen Huang, who vouched for San Francisco's "substantial progress" under Lurie's leadership. Mayor Lurie, emphasizing the city's commitment to safety and protecting immigrant communities, cautiously welcomed the development, while other local leaders remained wary of the president's unpredictable policy shifts.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro offers a profound exploration of his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, positing horror as a unique refuge for spirituality and a crucial lens for understanding human nature. He extols Shelley's youthful genius in crafting a narrative of tragedy rooted not in evil, but in abandonment and the arrogant pursuit of scientific mastery. Del Toro views the Creature's poignant journey as a timeless parable of solitude and the existential quest for meaning, themes that deeply inform and inspire his own cinematic storytelling.</p>

          <p>A French paleogenomic research team has made a significant discovery, identifying two previously unknown bacterial species, Salmonella enterica enterica (causing paratyphoid) and Borrelia recurrentis (causing relapsing fever), that contributed to the devastating losses suffered by Napoleon's Grande Armée during its 1812 Russian campaign. These findings, derived from advanced ancient DNA analysis of soldiers' remains, complement earlier identifications of typhus and trench fever. The combined onslaught of disease, severe starvation, and brutal freezing conditions proved overwhelmingly lethal, underscoring the profound impact of non-combat factors in historical warfare.</p>

Despite navigating higher costs from tariffs and a challenging global consumer environment, the company reiterated its fiscal year sales and earnings forecast. However, P&G noted that overall volume remained flat, indicating a softening demand in some categories as inflation-weary consumers adopt "K-shaped" shopping behaviors, either seeking value in larger packs or stretching product use.

          <p>A significant change for inherited IRAs in 2025 will mandate that certain non-spouse beneficiaries, such as adult children, must begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) while still depleting the account balance over a 10-year period. Failure to comply with these new IRS regulations could result in a substantial 25% penalty on the under-withdrawn amount, though waivers are possible under specific conditions. This necessitates meticulous tax planning for heirs, with financial experts recommending strategic withdrawals during lower-earning years to effectively manage potential tax implications.
