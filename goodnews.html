          <p>The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing after no one won Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize, with a cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. This jackpot is poised to be the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot won in November 2022 and the $1.765 billion jackpot won in October 2023. There have been six jackpots exceeding $1 billion in Powerball's 33-year history, with four won this year alone, and the odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million. Saturday's drawing marks the 42nd since the last Powerball jackpot was won on May 31, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings without a winner. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, although economic concerns continue to cast a shadow. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose by 1.56%, propelled by domestic tech stocks like SoftBank Group, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.96% after positive household spending data. In contrast, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell by 1.21%, and mainland China's CSI 300 declined by 2.47% amidst volatile trading, as global bond markets remain under scrutiny with rising borrowing costs. The article notes that the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield nudged above 5% after a court ruling questioned the future of tariff revenues. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 Welsh fans have traveled to Astana, Kazakhstan, for a 2026 World Cup qualifying match, marking a unique and distant journey for the Red Wall. Supporters have engaged in activities like horseback riding and trying local cuisine, including horse meat prepared "four ways." Despite the arduous travel, fans have been welcomed warmly by locals and have embraced the opportunity to explore a new culture. One fan detailed a five-week journey by train and bus through 12 countries to reach Kazakhstan, highlighting the dedication of Welsh supporters. The article emphasizes the contrast between the fans' experiences and the footballers' more limited exposure to the country. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

          <p>Martha's rule, a system allowing families to seek urgent second opinions about patient care, is being implemented in all English hospitals providing acute treatment. The initiative, inspired by the death of 13-year-old Martha Mills due to hospital failings, has been piloted in 143 sites since April 2024, resulting in nearly 5,000 calls and 241 potentially life-saving interventions. The scheme encourages families and staff to voice concerns about patient conditions and seek reviews from critical care teams, with clinicians recording daily insights from families. Martha's mother is advocating for the rule's expansion throughout the UK, emphasizing the need for more equitable doctor-patient relationships.

          <p>Jannik Sinner defeated Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets to reach the US Open semifinals, marking the first all-Italian men's quarterfinal at a Grand Slam. Sinner's consistency and powerful shots were too much for Musetti, who struggled to capitalize on break point opportunities. The match lacked tension, but Sinner remained composed and efficient, winning a high percentage of his first-serve points and minimizing unforced errors. Sinner will face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semifinals as he seeks to defend his US Open title. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

Sinner's dominant performance saw him win 6-1, 6-4, 6-2, with Musetti unable to convert any of his seven break points. Sinner acknowledged the challenge of facing a compatriot but emphasized the importance of separating friendship from competition. He has now won 26 consecutive matches at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments and will face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semi-final. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

          <p>A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre reveals that Chinese citizens hold nuanced views on US rivalry and alliances with Russia and North Korea. While optimistic about China's future, economy, and culture, a plurality (48%) believes China is interested in a shared leadership role, implying peaceful coexistence with the US. Experts caution that self-censorship may influence some findings, but the survey suggests avenues for reducing US-China tension. The article highlights the complexity of Chinese perspectives on international relations. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

          <p>A US federal court overturned billions in funding cuts by the Trump administration to Harvard University, ruling the government violated the college's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs stated the government used antisemitism as a smokescreen for an ideologically-motivated assault on premier universities. The White House vowed to appeal, claiming Harvard doesn't have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars. Harvard's president affirmed the ruling protects the university's First Amendment and procedural rights. The judge noted Harvard should have addressed antisemitism better but said fighting it wasn't the administration's true aim. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>
