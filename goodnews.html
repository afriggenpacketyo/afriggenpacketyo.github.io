          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 10:57:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts predict a likely decline in Certificate of Deposit (CD) account interest rates by late September, with average 12-month rates potentially falling 25 to 50 basis points by year-end. This forecast is largely based on expectations for the Federal Reserve to resume rate cuts, possibly in September, amid signs of slower economic growth and ticking unemployment. While some competition among banks might keep rates steady, a significant re-acceleration of inflation would be required for rates to rise. Savers are advised to consider locking in current high rates or using a CD ladder strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 75% after AT&T announced an agreement to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from the company for approximately $23 billion in cash. This deal will add about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 U.S. markets, and is expected to close in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval. EchoStar stated the transaction helps address Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout, which had drawn criticism from SpaceX. The agreement also expands their network services, allowing EchoStar to operate Boost Mobile as a hybrid mobile network operator. (not investment advice)</p>

The team aims to be competitive quickly, acknowledging the substantial work ahead for a new entrant in the sport.

          <p>Eli Lilly's daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, has successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global regulatory approval. The pill helped patients achieve an average weight loss of 10.5% and significantly lowered hemoglobin A1c levels, with most no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. This needle-free alternative to GLP-1 injections could expand access to obesity treatments due to easier manufacturing and a lack of dietary restrictions, despite some gastrointestinal side effects observed in the study. The company anticipates a global launch around next year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The student housing market is experiencing a significant shift, with rent growth slowing and an increasing preference for affordability over luxury amenities. According to a report by Yardi, average advertised asking rents declined, and students are opting for older, less expensive buildings, prioritizing functional spaces like co-working rooms over lavish features like hot tubs. Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, a major student housing owner, notes a trend of record enrollment growth at large public universities, driving investment towards these institutions. This shift, combined with reduced new development due to higher costs, is expected to increase the value of existing assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Budget retailer Poundland has successfully averted administration after the High Court approved its turnaround plan, which includes a significant cash injection and a restructuring of its operations. The company, facing severe financial deterioration, had warned it would run out of cash by early September without the deal. The plan involves £90 million in new funding from private equity firm Gordon Brothers, a three-year deferral of £276.5 million in loans, and rent reductions for unprofitable stores. Despite the rescue, the company will proceed with previously announced closures of 68 shops and two distribution sites, impacting about 1,000 jobs.</p>

          <p>Experts highlight various non-dairy food sources to help individuals meet their daily calcium requirements, essential for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Beyond traditional dairy products like yogurt and cheese, calcium can be found in fortified non-dairy milks, calcium-set tofu, and fortified fruit juices and cereals. Canned fish with bones, such as salmon and sardines, along with certain vegetables like kale, broccoli, and bok choy, are also good sources. Registered dietitians recommend a colorful, balanced diet, but advise consulting a doctor about supplements if concerns about calcium intake persist.</p>

The analysis notes a waning of French political influence, with many countries seeking new security partners, but enduring economic ties. The debate continues on whether the closely integrated French approach has hindered or helped economic development, with strong institutions being identified as a key need for future stability.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer has expressed doubts about England's ability to develop the "killer instinct" needed to win the Ashes series in Australia this winter. Langer, who has a strong Ashes record as both a player and coach, noted England's recent 2-2 draws against India and Australia, suggesting they had opportunities to win those series. He emphasized that England must maintain an aggressive approach, dubbed 'Bazball,' to challenge Australia's formidable bowling attack. England has struggled in Australia, winning only one Ashes series there since 1987, highlighting the challenge ahead.</p>

          <p>Gavin Newsom's recent social media posts, mocking Donald Trump's style, demonstrate a new approach for Democrats in the current attention economy. The article suggests that while Trump has mastered short, inflammatory language for the social media era, progressives can also succeed by combining a pugilistic style with policy substance. Newsom's actions, such as announcing an aggressive redistricting plan alongside his Trump impersonations, indicate a shift from the 'go high' strategy to a more direct, confrontational one. This approach aims to engage voters who increasingly seek a fighter on their behalf, adapting to a media landscape where thoughtful discourse is often overshadowed by attention-grabbing content.</p>

          <p>Starbucks' annual release of the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) continues to spark debate, with its earliest-ever launch date this year. The article delves into the historical backlash against the PSL, often framed as a critique of capitalism, seasonal creep, and the concept of 'basic' consumerism. However, it argues that much of this contempt is rooted in sexism, class anxiety, and skepticism towards savvy marketing, rather than the drink itself. Despite the criticism, the PSL remains Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage, highlighting its enduring cultural phenomenon and the company's successful marketing strategies.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged 26 feet below the Bay of Aarhus, Denmark, offering a rare glimpse into coastal life 8,500 years ago. This discovery is part of a major international project mapping sunken Northern European landscapes, driven by the expansion of offshore wind farms. Researchers found animal bones, stone tools, arrowheads, and a seal tooth, all preserved in an oxygen-free environment, effectively creating a time capsule. The findings provide crucial insights into how ancient societies adapted to rapid sea-level rises, a phenomenon with parallels to contemporary climate change challenges.</p>

          <p>The Precious Plastic project, an open-source initiative, provides free designs and toolkits for communities worldwide to build plastic recycling machines, addressing the growing waste crisis. Originating from a student's design over a decade ago, the project aims to lower barriers to plastic recycling, as only 5-9% of plastic waste is currently recycled globally. By enabling local communities to process plastic and create new products, the initiative reduces reliance on virgin plastic production, which contributes significantly to carbon emissions. This innovative approach fosters greater recycling rates and helps mitigate microplastic exposure, promoting a more sustainable future.</p>
