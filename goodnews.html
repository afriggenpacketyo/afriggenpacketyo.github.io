          <p>A Harris's hawk, notorious for attacking residents in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The bird, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," had dive-bombed around 50 people, leading to one hospitalization. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the hawk, investing around ¬£1,000 to build an aviary. Housden plans to keep the hawk and hopes to release it in the autumn, ensuring it will not be abandoned again, and he intends to bring Bomber Harris to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August. The article notes that the hawk was likely a captive-bred bird that had been loose for over a year.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani mourns the death of Bernard "Bernie" Kerik, former New York City Police Department Commissioner, calling him his "best friend" and a "true patriot." Giuliani recounts how Kerik was by his side within 20 minutes of the 9/11 attacks and remained with him throughout the recovery efforts. He praised Kerik's leadership in reducing violence at Rikers Island and crime in New York City. Kerik's career was marked by numerous awards but also included a prison sentence for felonies, later pardoned by President Trump, and his work with Giuliani to investigate claims of election fraud following the 2020 presidential election.</p>

          <p>This article explores seven interesting facts about Elon Musk, ranging from his early career to his ventures outside of Tesla and SpaceX. As a child, Musk created a video game called Blastar, and at 24, he co-founded Zip2, which sold for $300 million. He also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and co-founded X.com, which later became PayPal. Musk's persona partly inspired Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man, and despite popular belief, he didn't start Tesla but was an early investor and later CEO. Finally, Musk aims to create an "everything app" similar to WeChat through his acquisition of X.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year. Despite an early mistake in the final round when he nearly misspelled the word "commelina," Zaki recovered to correctly spell the winning word, "eclaircissement." Zaki's enthusiastic and joyful approach to spelling set him apart from other competitors. He attributed his near-miss to overemphasizing speed during study sessions. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki's victory adds to the trend of Indian American spellers dominating the competition.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes as "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases. The report calls for these tidal habitats to be included in the UK's official inventory of carbon emissions and removals. The study, conducted with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, used greenhouse gas monitoring stations on Hesketh Out Marsh to demonstrate how saltmarshes capture carbon dioxide. The UK has lost 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, but there is growing interest in restoring and protecting these valuable ecosystems.</p>

China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima plant. Japan has ruled out defense equipment purchases from the U.S. in return for tariff easing, and Tokyo's core consumer prices have risen at the fastest pace in over two years. The Trump administration has accused China of exploiting U.S. universities, and Japan's unemployment rate and job availability ratio remained unchanged in April.

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing deals with multinational companies, driven by cost savings and a shift away from raising funds through share sales. These deals often use a newco structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising via a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy. This trend reflects a broader strategy for Chinese biotech firms to leverage their intellectual property amid depressed valuations.</p>

The festival has seen the introduction of the Pyramid stage, partnerships with organizations like CND, and periods of extreme weather, including the "year of the mud" in 1997 and severe flooding in 2005. Security has been enhanced with the installation of a "super fence" in 2002 to prevent gatecrashers. The festival has also embraced diverse musical genres, with Jay-Z becoming the first hip-hop headliner in 2008, and this year's festival will be the last before a fallow year.</p>
