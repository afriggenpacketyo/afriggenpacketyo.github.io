          <p>A restaurant owner who had lost movement in his left arm and leg after a stroke has experienced significant recovery thanks to a new medical technology. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation therapy to enhance the brain's neuroplasticity. The device sends gentle pulses to the vagus nerve while the patient performs exercises, helping to rewire neural pathways. For this patient, the technology led to dramatic improvements in function and a reduction in pain after his progress with traditional therapy had stalled, offering new hope for stroke survivors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As trillions of dollars in wealth are expected to be passed down to younger generations, financial advisors are highlighting the complexities of transferring real estate. Handing down family homes, especially vacation properties, can lead to significant tax burdens and emotional conflicts among heirs. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust at death to take advantage of the "step-up in basis," which minimizes capital gains taxes for the inheritors. They also suggest using legal structures like LLCs to protect the assets from lawsuits and creating detailed operating agreements to prevent family disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article analyzes the concept of "wardrobe diplomacy" in the context of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House. After being criticized for his "bunker-chic" attire during a previous combative meeting, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt. This subtle change in appearance appeared to set a more serious and productive tone for his high-stakes meeting with President Trump, drawing positive comments. The article posits that while clothing doesn't define a leader, it can be a powerful tool in political communication, referencing historical examples like Winston Churchill's wartime attire.</p>

          <p>The latest season of "South Park" is receiving significant attention for its direct and unrestrained satire of the Trump administration, a move that has boosted its relevance and ratings. In an interview, CNN media analyst Brian Stelter discusses how the show's creators are targeting figures like President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem with scathing parodies. This comes at a sensitive time for parent company Paramount, which recently settled a lawsuit with the administration. Despite this, the show's immense financial value, particularly a billion-dollar streaming deal, appears to be protecting its creative freedom.</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful hurricanes, Floridians are exploring new ways to rebuild and protect their communities. Following the devastation of Hurricane Ian, some residents are moving to master-planned towns like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with climate resilience in mind, featuring advanced stormwater systems and hurricane-proof construction. In other areas, particularly lower-income neighborhoods, government programs and nonprofits are helping residents rebuild their homes at higher elevations with stronger materials. These efforts highlight a growing recognition of the need for proactive mitigation, though funding challenges remain significant obstacles.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man has finally received his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys in Florida. Eddie Horne was a student at the state-run reform school, known for its brutal conditions, in the mid-1960s. He dropped out to support his family but never gave up on his goal of graduating. Through a compensation program established for victims of the school, he was able to complete the requirements and proudly walked across the graduation stage, hoping his story inspires others to overcome adversity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that Americans, on average, believe the ideal retirement age is 58, which is significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors caution that retiring this early presents substantial challenges, as it requires a much larger nest egg to fund a retirement that could last 30 to 40 years. Many who retire early do so not by choice but due to health or employment issues. Experts stress the importance of aggressive, early saving and careful planning for expenses like healthcare.

          <h2>Dermatologists Explain the Unique Benefits of Tinted Sunscreen for Skin Protection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tinted sunscreens offer a key benefit that standard sunscreens do not: protection against visible light. While most sun protection focuses on UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions more common in people with darker skin. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, which gives tinted products their color and is often absent in regular sunscreens. Dermatologists recommend looking for products with iron oxide to help prevent these skin conditions, though they note that the range of available shades still needs to expand.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet high within its summit crater. This marks the 31st eruptive display since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to homes. The U.S. Geological Survey is closely monitoring the volcano, whose frequent eruptions provide spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that the episodic fountaining is caused by magma building up in a chamber before being forcefully released, a pattern the volcano has exhibited previously.</p>

          <p>After a five-year legal battle initiated by some residents, a street in central Berlin will finally be renamed to honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate in the 18th century. The street was previously named "Mohrenstrasse," a term with racist connotations rooted in Germany's colonial history and the enslavement of Africans. Civil society groups have campaigned for decades for the change, which is seen as a significant act of decolonization. The official renaming coincides with the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, marking a symbolic shift in public memory.</p>

The drones are equipped with high-resolution cameras, including thermal imaging and zoom lenses, capable of identifying individuals from a significant distance. This technology will provide real-time images to officers on the ground and in a central control room, helping to manage crowd safety, a major concern for the event. The move is part of a broader safety strategy that also includes the controversial use of live facial recognition technology.</p>
