          <p>President Trump concluded a five-day trip to Scotland by officially opening a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, which also included golfing at his Turnberry resort, was largely focused on promoting his family's business interests. During the trip, Trump also met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and agreed to a framework for a major U.S.-EU trade deal, though many details remain unresolved. The new course is the third Trump Organization property in Scotland, and the visit highlights the ongoing use of the presidency to promote his personal brand.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has confirmed that the club has not yet received a formal offer for its top scorer, Alexander Isak. The 25-year-old Swedish striker, who is reportedly exploring a potential summer transfer, did not travel with the team for its pre-season tour, officially due to a minor injury. Despite reports of interest from clubs like Liverpool, Howe stated that Isak remains a contracted Newcastle player. However, the manager also admitted that the player's future is not entirely within his control, though his personal wish is for Isak to stay with the club.</p>

          <h2>Peak of Perseid Meteor Shower in August May Be Obscured by Bright Moon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the most popular celestial events, is set to peak on the night of August 11-12, but viewing conditions may be challenging this year. According to astronomers, a bright, waning gibbous moon will be about 92% full, and its glare is expected to wash out many of the fainter meteors. While the shower can typically produce 50 to 100 meteors per hour, far fewer will be visible. Stargazers are advised to find locations far from city lights and hope for an increase in fireballs, which are brighter, longer-lasting meteors that the Perseids are known for producing.</p>

          <p>An El Segundo-based startup, Shinkei Systems, is using robotics and AI to automate a traditional Japanese fish-handling method called ikejime, which is said to enhance flavor, texture, and shelf life. The company's robot, Poseidon, performs the humane killing technique, which involves spiking the fish's brain to prevent the release of stress hormones that degrade quality. By automating this labor-intensive process, Shinkei aims to make higher-quality, longer-lasting, and more humanely handled fish widely available in U.S. grocery stores. The company recently secured $22 million in funding to expand its operations, which are currently active on fishing vessels in the Pacific and Atlantic.</p>

In contrast, Hong Kong International Airport's traffic, though growing, remains below its 2019 levels.

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its key short-term interest rate, an analysis of the first half of 2025 shows that consumer borrowing costs have remained largely stable. The average rate for credit card balances has hovered around 20.1%, and auto loan rates have seen little movement. Mortgage rates, which are more closely tied to 10-year Treasury yields, have fluctuated in a narrow band between 6.6% and 7.1%. This stability suggests that even if the Fed were to cut its benchmark rate, there is no guarantee it would translate directly into lower borrowing costs for most Americans.

          <p>China's top manufacturing regulator has vowed to tighten oversight and phase out outdated capacity in key industrial sectors, including electric vehicles and solar power, to combat excessive competition. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced it would use upgraded standards to force out obsolete production facilities and consolidate the results of a crackdown on intense internal competition, or 'neijuan'. This move is part of a broader government effort to manage overcapacity and regulate what it calls "low-quality, cut-price competition," while also promoting hi-tech consumer goods to stimulate domestic demand.</p>

          <p>Google is launching a new optional "AI Mode" for its search engine in the UK, representing a major shift in how it presents information. Instead of a traditional list of links, the feature will use generative AI to provide a conversational, written answer to user queries, with fewer direct links to external websites. This move has raised concerns among publishers and businesses who rely on Google search traffic for revenue and visibility. While Google says the tool unlocks new ways to seek information, critics worry it will disincentivize users from clicking through to original sources, potentially undermining the business models of news outlets and other firms.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the European Union and the United States could provide an unexpected economic advantage to the United Kingdom, according to some economists. The deal sets a 15% tariff on EU goods imported into the U.S., which is higher than the 10% levy the U.K. has already agreed to. This five-point difference could make British exports relatively cheaper for American consumers and businesses, potentially boosting U.K. trade. Analysts suggest this tariff differential might even incentivize some EU-based companies to shift manufacturing to the U.K. to gain more favorable access to the U.S. market.

This shift is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to move its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs.
