          <h2>Why Are So Many Straight Men Bad at Gossiping?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 10:16:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article explores the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, examining the reasons behind this perception and its implications for male relationships. While studies show that men gossip as much as women, they may lack the cultural opportunities and social training to do it effectively. This can be attributed to societal expectations that discourage men from being "messy" or openly engaging in gossip, which is often seen as unmanly. The article suggests that improving men's gossiping skills could help them build stronger relationships and combat the male loneliness epidemic, as sharing stories and personal information is crucial for intimacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas in a dispute over the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to store nuclear waste in the state. The court found that Texas and a land developer were not parties to the licensing proceeding and therefore lacked standing to seek judicial review. The decision reverses a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, highlighting the ongoing political and logistical challenges of addressing nuclear waste storage. The case underscores the complexities of nuclear waste management and the balance between state concerns and federal regulatory authority.</p>
