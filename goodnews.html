        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has approved legislation raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had curtailed a deduction that was previously unlimited for over a century. Proponents argue the higher cap provides relief to taxpayers in high-tax states, mitigating what they see as double taxation. However, fiscal analyses from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Foundation project the change will significantly increase the national debt by hundreds of billions over the next decade.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:05:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable environment for reinvesting their funds. Letting a CD roll over automatically could lock in a much lower rate than previously enjoyed. Financial experts suggest exploring alternatives such as high-yield savings accounts, which still offer competitive rates with greater flexibility, or money market accounts that combine high interest with checking features. Another strategy is to lock in current rates with a new long-term CD, which provides security against future rate drops despite being lower than recent peaks. (not investment advice)</p>

His teammate Oscar Piastri finished fourth, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, showcasing a competitive mix of teams at the top. The high-speed Monza circuit presents a different challenge from recent races, and drivers were seen testing the limits, with several minor incidents occurring throughout the sessions.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot's climb to $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, is providing a significant business boost for lottery courier apps like Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported that 15 million tickets have been ordered through its platform during the current jackpot run, with daily sales increasing by 130%. DraftKings acquired Jackpocket in 2024, viewing it as a key asset for cross-selling customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming services. The company projects the acquisition will add hundreds of millions in incremental revenue by fiscal 2026, highlighting the strategic value of lottery services.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Experience Largest Single-Day Decline in Over a Year Following Weak Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 13:38:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, marking its largest one-day drop since August 2024 and reaching its lowest point since October. This sharp decrease was a direct reaction to the unexpectedly weak August employment report, which eased investor concerns about Federal Reserve rate hikes. For a homebuyer purchasing a $450,000 property, this rate drop could translate to a monthly saving of around $169. However, economists remain uncertain if this decline will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty continue to sideline many potential buyers.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than 40,000 pounds of cocaine and the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past month. The successful interceptions are part of "Operation Pacific Viper," a heightened counter-drug operation designed to disrupt cartel trafficking routes from South America. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted. This series of seizures follows a recent record-breaking offload in Fort Lauderdale, highlighting the scale of ongoing efforts to combat illicit drug shipments in both the Pacific and the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, is set to face Australia's Wallaroos in a crucial World Cup match, with England heavily favored to continue their undefeated streak against the Australians. The match holds significance for both teams, as England aims to fine-tune its strategy for the knockout stages, while Australia fights for a bonus point to secure its own place. The contest will also feature rising Australian star Caitlyn Halse, an 18-year-old fullback, and will be a poignant match for Australia's coach Jo Yapp, a former England captain who is stepping down after the tournament.</p>

          <p>A new photograph of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system, shows its tail has grown significantly, indicating it has become more active as it approaches the sun. The image was captured by the International Gemini Observatory in Chile and reveals a more extended coma—the cloud of dust and gas around the nucleus—than seen in previous images. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October. Scientists are studying the light spectrum from the comet to learn more about its composition and understand how it changes during its journey through our solar system.</p>

          <p>A recent article in The Atlantic reflects on the "remarkable ability" of political dissidents to persevere in the face of seemingly hopeless situations, drawing parallels between protests in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the current political climate in the United States. Author Lauren Grodstein describes how witnessing Georgians protest a pro-Russian government, despite the low probability of success, reshaped her understanding of civic duty. The piece connects this to the mindset of Soviet-era dissenters, who maintained their opposition even when they knew it was futile. It poses the question of when citizens in a democracy must decide to "put themselves on the line" to defend their values.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," pop icon Debbie Gibson reflects on her decades-long career, which began when she became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard No. 1 hit at age 17. Gibson credits her late mother, Diane, who served as her manager, for being instrumental to her success by fighting for her creative control in a male-dominated industry. She discusses her journey from a teenager writing songs daily in a makeshift home studio to navigating the pressures of the music business. Gibson says she is now thriving more than ever by embracing an independent spirit and a direct connection with her audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, the potential winner faces a significant reduction in their prize due to taxes. The lump sum cash option is valued at $826.4 million, from which the IRS mandates an immediate 24% federal withholding, amounting to nearly $198.3 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the top 37% federal income tax bracket, the final tax bill will be considerably higher. State taxes can further reduce the take-home amount, with some states levying income taxes over 10%, while others have no tax on lottery winnings.</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local law that banned the development of homeless shelters and other services for the poor, settling a lawsuit filed by the state. Attorney General Rob Bonta had sued the city, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. As part of the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies. State officials said the outcome demonstrates their resolve to challenge local governments that attempt to block necessary housing and services for homeless residents.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a new 23-track album, "Swag II," as a surprise follow-up to his "Swag" collection, which dropped less than two months ago. The new record continues in a similar musical vein, featuring Bieber's vocals over indie rock and '80s R&B-influenced productions, a departure from his earlier pop and EDM sound. The album was created with many of the same producers as its predecessor and includes guest appearances from artists like Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris. Thematically, the songs continue to explore Bieber's experiences with marriage, fatherhood, and religion, reinforcing the personal nature of his recent work.</p>
