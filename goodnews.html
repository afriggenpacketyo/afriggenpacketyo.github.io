        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is easing its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, signaling a shift to revitalize domestic demand amid trade tensions with the United States. K-pop group Epex is set to perform in Fuzhou, marking the first concert by an all-Korean idol group in mainland China since 2016. The large-scale Dream Concert is also scheduled to take place in Hainan province. Analysts suggest this policy shift is part of China's broader strategy to stimulate discretionary spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce, with K-pop seen as a tariff-proof sector immune to cross-border tariffs.

          <p>Nigel Farage’s right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling a potential shift in British politics.

          <p>Apple is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices for the US market away from China due to President Trump's tariffs. The majority of iPhones sold in the US will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for iPads and Apple Watches. CEO Tim Cook says the company is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move. The company estimates that US import taxes could add about $900m to its costs in the current quarter. (optimism score: 75)</p>
