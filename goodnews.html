          <p>Judge Charles Breyer, brother of retired Justice Stephen Breyer, has been assigned to oversee California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration. The lawsuit alleges that President Trump deprived California of its sovereignty by federalizing National Guard soldiers in response to anti-immigration enforcement protests and riots in Los Angeles County. Newsom claims Trump's mobilization of the National Guard was an "unprecedented power grab," while Trump asserts it was necessary to protect ICE personnel and federal buildings.

          <p>Credit card interest rates have slightly decreased from their record high in late 2024, but remain elevated, creating financial challenges for cardholders with substantial debt. While the Federal Reserve may further cut rates later in the year, the impact on existing debt is likely to be minimal.
