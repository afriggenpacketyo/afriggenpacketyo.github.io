          <p>China has inaugurated a new-generation radio telescope in Chiang Mai, Thailand, developed in collaboration with the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand. This 13-meter radio antenna is part of a broader network designed to monitor deep space signals and track subtle shifts in the Earth‚Äôs rotation and tectonic plates. A second telescope is under construction in southern Thailand to further enhance deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting. The project, initiated in 2017, marks a significant milestone in scientific cooperation between China and Thailand, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The telescope captured its first signal in August of last year and has since completed a full 24-hour observation session, meeting expected precision benchmarks. </p>

          <p>Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) has dismissed allegations that she directed staffers to create "burner" accounts to boost her online image, labeling the claims as the product of "bitter exes" lacking real proof. Mace, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, responded to a recent Wired magazine article citing anonymous former aides and consultants who alleged she used burner accounts and automated bots to amplify her political messaging. Mace asserts that she doesn't need burner accounts to tell the truth and posts everything from her real account with her name on it, emphasizing accountability. She also highlighted her background as a self-taught computer coder, stating it gives her an edge in crafting meaningful policy focused on protecting data, cracking down on cyber threats, and pushing back against Big Tech censorship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it will keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions in facilities across several states. Trump stated that Nippon would invest $14 billion in the company, including $2.2 billion to increase steel production in Pittsburgh's Mon Valley area and $7 billion to modernize steel mills and expand facilities in other states. He also announced plans to double the current 25% tariff on steel imports to 50% and promised a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and that the company would still be "controlled by the USA," although he did not specify the ownership structure.

The musical will explore why he wanted to take on such life-affirming tasks and at what cost, highlighting his struggles with addiction and mental health.

The hiker, who remained conscious, was harnessed to a 150-foot rope and lifted out by the helicopter. The rescue team determined that a helicopter extraction was necessary due to the severity of the injuries and the remote location, which would have made a timely ambulance arrival impossible.

He also mentioned that $14bn would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel.
