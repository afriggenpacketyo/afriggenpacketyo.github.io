          <p>Chinese mining giant Ganfeng has partnered with Swiss-based Lithium Argentina to develop one of South America's largest lithium extraction projects. The joint venture aims to produce 150,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent annually from high-altitude brine in Argentina's northwest. This collaboration is set to enhance the global lithium supply chain, which is critical for manufacturing electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage systems. The partnership highlights the intensifying global race to secure essential metals for the green energy transition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while megacap tech stocks, including the "Magnificent 7," saw a downturn. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are expected to disproportionately benefit smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on financing for growth and operations. The shift suggests investors are repositioning portfolios in anticipation of a new phase in monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of cargo in July, handling over one million container units for the first time in its 117-year history. This surge was driven by shippers front-loading goods from China to get ahead of impending tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. While the port managed the volume without delays, logistics experts note that the peak season started and slowed earlier than normal. The data indicates that uncertainty over trade policy is significantly altering supply chain behavior and creating volatility for importers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article praises President Trump's decision to use federal resources to address crime in Washington, D.C., comparing it to ancient Roman principles where public safety is the supreme law. The author dismisses critics' claims as politically motivated and argues that residents' lived experiences of crime are more important than statistics showing recent drops from high levels. The piece frames the action as a model for other cities, akin to Rudy Giuliani's successful crime reduction in 1990s New York. It concludes that the move is a hopeful effort to restore safety that most Americans should support.</p>

          <p>A recently passed budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 savings plans, which were originally designed for higher education costs. The new rules expand the definition of qualified educational expenses to include costs for vocational programs, required continuing education, and professional licensing preparation. This change allows families to use the tax-advantaged funds for a much broader range of career and training paths beyond traditional college. The expansion aims to make 529 plans a more versatile tool for lifelong learning and professional development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League is estimating that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025. The annual COLA is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation, and the official figure will be announced by the Social Security Administration in the fall. While inflation has been moderate, some economists worry that potential future increases could mean this modest adjustment may not be sufficient for retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange Bullish surged in their New York Stock Exchange debut, more than doubling after the company priced its IPO well above the expected range. The company, led by former NYSE President Tom Farley and backed by Peter Thiel, raised approximately $1.1 billion. The successful offering is seen as a sign of growing institutional investor interest in the crypto sector. Bullish's strong market entry is part of a new wave of crypto-related companies going public, capitalizing on a more favorable regulatory environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis of an Incan khipu, a complex record-keeping device made of knotted cords, suggests the practice may have been more widespread than previously thought. Researchers discovered a khipu from around 1498 with a primary cord made of human hair, a practice that could serve as a signature. A dietary analysis of the hair indicated its owner was likely a commoner, not a member of the ruling elite who were long assumed to be the sole producers of khipus. This finding challenges the historical narrative written by Spanish colonizers and suggests a broader literacy across Incan society.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The move comes as rising tariffs spark renewed concerns about inflation and higher consumer prices. In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expanded discount was one of its most requested benefits from employees. The decision could serve multiple purposes: easing the financial burden on its workforce, boosting employee morale and retention, and encouraging its own staff to shop more at Walmart stores.</p>

          <p>Tom Dundon, the owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, has reached a tentative agreement to buy the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. While the terms were not disclosed, the team was recently valued at $3.65 billion. Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman and chairman of Dundon Capital Partners, is also a major owner in professional pickleball leagues. The sale, which is subject to NBA approval, would end the stewardship of Jody Allen, who has managed the team since her brother's death in 2018.</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated there are no current plans to play top-flight matches abroad, saying the idea is "not anywhere near my in-tray." His comments come as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A seek permission to stage league games in the U.S. and Australia. The Premier League had previously floated a "39th game" concept in 2008 but shelved it after strong criticism from fans. Masters suggested that the league has found other ways to grow its international presence, making the controversial concept unnecessary for now.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, this article explores the option of negotiating directly with creditors for debt relief as an alternative to hiring a professional service. While a DIY approach avoids fees and keeps the borrower in control, it requires persistence, preparation, and a solid understanding of debt laws. The article warns of potential pitfalls, such as a lack of negotiation strategy and the risk of costly missteps regarding taxes on forgiven debt and credit score impacts. It advises that successful self-negotiation is a complex, high-stakes process. (not investment advice)</p>
