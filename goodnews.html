          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported "substantial progress" in tariff talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland, though details remain scarce, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions. The talks, held in Geneva, seek to reduce tariffs imposed by both countries, potentially stabilizing global markets. President Trump expressed optimism, hinting at tariff reductions, while Chinese officials urged the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. Despite progress, significant differences remain, particularly regarding China's trade practices and the U.S. trade deficit, necessitating further negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Scientists are making strides in helping paralyzed individuals regain mobility and bodily functions through innovative technologies like the "digital bridge," which bypasses spinal cord injuries to restore communication between the brain and spinal cord. Spinal cord stimulation shows potential in helping people with Parkinson's disease regain mobility. Researchers are conducting clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy, with the goal of offering therapies to address various needs, such as restoring hand function, normalizing blood pressure, and improving bladder function. The vision is to provide a menu of options for individuals with spinal cord injuries to regain control over their bodies.</p>

The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. The statue is expected to be stored at a museum following a ceremony at the temple. After the statue was stolen, a South Korean temple filed a lawsuit claiming it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership.</p>
