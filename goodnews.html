          <p>Shares of steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs surged by 17% following the company's announcement that it is exploring the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business. CEO Lourenco Goncalves revealed that geological surveys have indicated the presence of these critical minerals at two company sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This strategic move aligns with the national goal of achieving material independence from China, which currently dominates the global supply chain. Rare earth elements are vital for manufacturing magnets used in electric vehicles, advanced weaponry, and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a nearly 3% rise after a new report from Counterpoint research indicated strong initial sales for the iPhone 17 series in both the United States and China. The latest models reportedly outsold the previous iPhone 16 series by 14% within the first ten days of availability, driven by the compelling value of the base model. This positive market reception prompted investment bank Loop Capital to upgrade Apple's stock from "hold" to "buy," significantly raising its price target. The strong demand suggests potential for material upside beyond current Wall Street expectations.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate candidate backed by left-wing parties, has won the Turkish Cypriot leadership election with a decisive 62.8% of the vote, defeating the incumbent Ersin Tatar. Erhurman's victory is seen as a clear message in favor of resuming negotiations for a federal solution to the long-standing Cyprus problem, a departure from the two-state solution pursued by his predecessor and Turkey. His campaign also emphasized preserving the secular identity of the Turkish Cypriot community against perceived interference from Ankara. Greek Cypriot leaders have welcomed the result as an opportunity to restart stalled peace talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. Speaking on CNBC, Hassett stated that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider implementing "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown stems from a partisan disagreement over federal funding, with Democrats demanding that any stopgap bill include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats might soon move forward to reopen the government, allowing for policy negotiations to resume through regular order.</p>

          <p>Amid significant market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello suggests that income-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) utilizing options-based strategies can offer protection for risk-averse investors. These funds are designed to provide downside protection that is not reliant on traditional asset correlations and can generate income that is insensitive to interest rate changes. Burrello highlights that this approach is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle, as it offers a diversifying source of income without depending on Federal Reserve policy. He advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual "Carrie Bradshaw index," which identifies the most affordable U.S. cities for individuals to live alone, based on the principle of spending no more than 30% of gross income on rent. Wichita, Kansas, topped the list as the most affordable city, where the median wage is 75% higher than what is needed to rent a typical studio apartment. The report noted that several Texas cities, including Dallas and Houston, have become unaffordable this year due to rising rents, likely driven by an influx of middle-class workers. The index found 41 U.S. cities to be unaffordable for solo dwellers.</p>

The U.S. government is actively supporting this sector, with the Defense Department having already struck a deal with MP Materials. This policy push is aimed at securing a domestic supply of these critical minerals, which are essential for technology and defense applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that state Medicaid programs should cover new weight-loss drugs known as GLP-1s, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, for the millions of low-income Americans suffering from obesity. While the high cost of these medications presents a significant budgetary challenge, the author contends that the long-term benefits, including reduced healthcare spending on obesity-related diseases, would offset the initial expense. The piece suggests that costs are overstated, as Medicaid pays significantly less for drugs than private insurers, and prices are expected to fall as more competitors enter the market. Denying coverage creates further health inequalities for an already vulnerable population.</p>

Experts suggest that if inflation remains controlled and the job market shows signs of weakening, rates could continue to fall, potentially dipping below 6%. However, a stronger-than-expected economy could keep rates elevated.

          <p>Columbia University business psychology professor Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic argues that mastering specific social skills is more crucial for career success than simply "being yourself." He identifies three key abilities: being receptive to critical feedback, cultivating social awareness by focusing on others' needs, and demonstrating adaptability by stepping out of one's comfort zone to learn new skills. According to Chamorro-Premuzic, these components of emotional intelligence make individuals more employable and rewarding to work with. He advises soliciting honest, constructive criticism to close the gap between self-perception and actual performance, thereby fostering professional growth.</p>
