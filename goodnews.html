          <p>President Donald Trump attended the New York Yankees' 9/11 anniversary game against the Detroit Tigers, marking his first appearance at a Major League Baseball game since 2021. Prior to the game, he met with the team in the clubhouse and delivered a speech. The event at Yankee Stadium featured heightened security, partly due to the president's attendance and also in the wake of the recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The visit was a commemorative occasion, with the stadium scoreboard displaying highlights from the 2001 World Series, which took place shortly after the September 11th attacks.</p>

          <p>Following a session where all three major stock indexes closed at record levels, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against market cynics, stating he remains bullish on the market's trajectory. He suggested that bearish investors are being overwhelmed by positive events, such as softer economic data that may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Cramer believes that despite broad concerns like national debt and geopolitical tensions, numerous individual companies are undervalued and poised for growth, urging bearish money managers to shift their perspective or risk losing their clients' investments.

          <p>Angel Studios, the company behind the successful 2023 film "Sound of Freedom," has gone public, with its shares rising 8% on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Utah-based firm, which focuses on producing "values-based storytelling," evolved from the movie-filtering service VidAngel after a copyright lawsuit. The studio now operates a streaming service and utilizes a unique crowdfunding model where its 1.5 million "Angel Guild" members vote on which projects get made. The public offering was necessitated by the company's large number of private investors.</p>

          <p>Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance experienced significant surges following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a buyout offer for its rival.

Combining Paramount's franchises like Star Trek and Mission Impossible with Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, which include DC superheroes, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, would establish a dominant force in theatrical releases and streaming. The deal would also consolidate significant sports media rights, including the UFC, NHL, and March Madness, creating a powerful competitor to existing giants like Disney and its ESPN division.</p>

          <p>With the latest consumer price index report showing that inflation rose to 2.9% in August, this article suggests that investors may want to consider gold as a hedge. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset that tends to maintain its value, and can even rise in price, during periods of economic uncertainty and currency devaluation. The article notes that while inflation is cyclical, the recent upward trend could make a portfolio allocation to gold a prudent strategy to protect purchasing power, though it cautions against over-investing.

          <p>The search for the next chair of the Federal Reserve is actively underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leading the process by meeting with several potential candidates. Recent interviews included former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard, who are on President Trump's short list. In addition to vetting candidates, Bessent is reportedly advocating for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce the Fed's massive bond portfolio and lessen its overall economic footprint. The selection comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the Fed by the White House.</p>

          <p>Average mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in almost a year, with 30-year terms now at 6.35%. This continued decline is attributed to expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The lower rates may present a significant opportunity for prospective homebuyers and homeowners considering a refinance. The article advises consumers to assess their financial situations and weigh the risks of waiting for potentially lower rates against the possibility that they could rise again, as they did in 2024.

          <p>As part of a new trade deal, Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in U.S.-based projects in exchange for a lower 15% baseline tariff rate. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will initially split the profits from these projects equally until Japan's $550 billion investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift heavily in favor of the United States, with America receiving 90% and Japan 10%.
