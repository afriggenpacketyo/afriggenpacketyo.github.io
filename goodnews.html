          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is publicly refuting accusations from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who alleged the agency was concealing dysfunction and removing important data. In a letter, SSA Commissioner Frank J. Bisignano contended that the agency's performance and transparency have significantly improved under the Trump administration compared to the previous one. The SSA provided data indicating that key service metrics, such as phone wait times and disability claim backlogs, have seen substantial reductions. The commissioner urged an end to the political "weaponizing" of Social Security, asserting the agency's commitment to modernization and service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the fourth consecutive month in August, but the 0.1% year-on-year decline was significantly less severe than economists had predicted. This better-than-expected performance was largely driven by a rebound in shipments to other parts of Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe. However, exports to the United States continued to fall sharply, particularly in the automotive sector, despite a recent trade deal intended to lower tariffs. The data provides a complex picture of Japan's trade health amid global economic pressures and domestic political uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old woman in Chino Hills, California, successfully defended herself against an attempted robbery by throwing her beverage at the assailant. The suspect, a 29-year-old man, reportedly brandished a knife and demanded the teenager hand over her tea. The woman's quick thinking to toss the drink at him created an opportunity for her to escape and contact law enforcement. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived at the shopping center and arrested the man shortly after the incident. No injuries were reported, and the suspect was booked on one count of robbery before being released on bail.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested that artificial intelligence could boost the United Kingdom's economy by as much as 10% within the next five years. His comments came as Microsoft announced a new $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector, its largest outside the United States. This investment is part of a broader £31 billion agreement between the UK government and several US tech giants, including Nvidia and Google, to build AI-supporting infrastructure like data centers. While the deal is hailed as a significant step for economic growth, it also raises concerns about energy consumption and the UK's reliance on foreign technology.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $23.50 per share, placing the company's valuation at $8.6 billion. The pricing falls at the midpoint of the range the company projected last week, with shares expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB." After being acquired by eBay in 2007 and then reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, StubHub's path to going public has faced several delays. The launch comes amid a resurgent IPO market that has seen successful debuts from several other major tech and finance companies recently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Redford, the iconic actor and director, is being remembered not just for his classic good looks but for his commitment to complex and challenging roles that often subverted his all-American image. Throughout his career, he deliberately rejected simple, heroic parts in favor of characters that explored flawed idealism and the darker aspects of success, as seen in films like "The Candidate" and "The Great Gatsby." He used his stardom to make thought-provoking political thrillers such as "All the President's Men" and "Three Days of the Condor." Redford's legacy also includes founding the Sundance Institute, which has championed independent filmmaking for decades.</p>

          <p>Five unfinished, three-story homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon neighborhood are set to be demolished following a two-decade-long dispute with the city. The structures were part of a larger development project that was halted in 2002 pending an environmental assessment that never occurred, leading to a demolition order in 2003. Despite the order, a series of owners attempted to restart construction, prompting legal action from the city. The current developers have now entered a plea agreement, requiring them to tear down the dilapidated and dangerous structures by August 2026.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals that a quarter of all driving tests are now being conducted in automatic cars, a significant increase from just over 6% a decade ago. This trend is largely attributed to the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that learners find automatics easier to handle, which can reduce stress during tests and potentially improve road safety by allowing drivers to focus more on their surroundings.</p>

          <p>Strong winds in Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash that was deposited during the major 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, creating hazy skies and reducing air quality in the area. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry conditions and high winds lift the loose material back into the atmosphere. Both the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity. The USGS has reiterated that the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal," though the airborne ash can pose a hazard to aircraft.</p>

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted to a more pragmatic, defense-focused style of play, a stark contrast to the attack-minded approach of the previous season. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games this season. While the cautious strategy resulted in the team registering only one shot on target, players and the manager have emphasized the importance of defensive solidity. The team's structure and discipline have made them a more difficult opponent to break down.</p>

After a 12-year absence, the return was driven by a strong desire from the players to compete at a best-on-best international level. The league's previous reluctance stemmed from issues like a lack of control and promotional rights during the Games. A new agreement with the IOC has addressed some of these commercial concerns, making the two-week shutdown of the NHL season a worthwhile endeavor for the league.</p>

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), believes it is unlikely that more major sports teams or ownership groups will go public. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that publicly traded sports assets have historically been valued lower than private ones and have not been fully embraced by public markets. He argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which can involve significant spending that public markets might not favor. With leagues like the NFL now allowing private equity investment, teams have alternative ways to raise capital while maintaining this long-term focus.</p>
