          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following President Trump's suggestion of an impending agreement between the U.S. and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program, leading to speculation about increased oil exports from Iran.

The article also provides background on Iran's economic struggles since the U.S. withdrew from the original nuclear deal in 2018, including protests, currency devaluation, and regional conflicts.

          <p>President Trump voiced his disapproval to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding the company's plans to increase production in India. Trump emphasized his preference for Apple to build its products in the U.S., referencing Apple's $500 billion investment commitment. Apple has been actively shifting production to India to reduce reliance on China, aiming to manufacture around 25% of global iPhones in India within a few years. Trump told Cook that the U.S. has tolerated Apple's plants in China for years, but now expects the company to prioritize domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the UK economy is showing signs of recovery, with growth exceeding expectations in the first quarter of the year. The 0.7% growth was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts cautioned that this strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Reeves acknowledged the ongoing cost of living crisis but highlighted the UK's potential to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the first three months of the year.</p>
