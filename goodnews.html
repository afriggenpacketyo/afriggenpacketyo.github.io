        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that California, a leader in electric vehicle adoption, is missing a key opportunity by not promoting daytime charging at workplaces. Charging EVs midday aligns with peak solar energy production, which is both cheaper and cleaner than the natural gas-powered grid used for overnight home charging. Research from UC San Diego suggests that while informing drivers of these benefits helps, stronger incentives like real-time electricity pricing are needed to shift habits. The author contends that expanding reliable workplace charging infrastructure is crucial for utilizing surplus renewable energy and further reducing emissions from transportation.</p>

          <p>Amidst growing uncertainty about the future of work due to artificial intelligence, an opinion piece argues that higher education should focus on cultivating humanistic traits rather than purely technical skills. Several technology leaders suggest that as AI handles technical tasks, uniquely human qualities like empathy, critical thinking, and moral judgment will become more valuable. The author posits that a liberal arts education, centered on dialogue, deep reading, and grappling with complex questions, is an ideal way to develop these skills. This approach strengthens attention and fosters wisdom, providing students with an intellectual fearlessness that prepares them for an unpredictable, AI-driven world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, significantly reducing the cost of weekday travel for many commuters. This move, which follows a pilot scheme, aims to encourage more people to switch from cars to trains, offering environmental and financial benefits. For example, a journey between Edinburgh and Glasgow during peak hours will now be nearly 50% cheaper. First Minister John Swinney stated the policy is a sustainable investment in the rail network and its passengers, with the annual cost of £40-45 million to be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased ridership.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai has appointed two younger officials, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. Both in their thirties, they replace more seasoned deputies in a move aimed at bringing fresh perspectives to Taiwan's security strategy as it navigates complex relations with Beijing and the United States. The appointments follow a drop in approval ratings for President Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party, particularly among young voters. The government hopes that blending veteran experience with younger talent will make the council more adept at responding to rapidly changing global dynamics.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's expanded childcare support program has launched, offering 30 hours of government-funded care per week for children aged nine months to four years. While the scheme is intended to save working parents thousands of pounds annually, many are encountering long waiting lists and a shortage of available nursery places. The sector is reportedly struggling with workforce issues, needing an estimated 35,000 more staff to meet the increased demand. Additionally, parents have expressed confusion over extra fees for consumables, which nurseries say are necessary to cover shortfalls in government funding rates.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant restructuring of his Downing Street team, a move widely seen as an admission that his first year in office has not met expectations. The changes include the creation of a new Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister role and a clear focus on strengthening economic expertise within his inner circle, with key appointments from the Treasury and the Bank of England. This reorganization is interpreted as an effort to gain firmer control over the government machine and prioritize economic delivery ahead of the autumn Budget, which is considered a defining moment for his premiership.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reached an agreement to acquire 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for an initial fee of £18.1 million. Lammens is set to sign a five-year contract, with the move intended to address the club's recent goalkeeping issues. The signing signals an end to United's pursuit of Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez. Lammens, who joined Antwerp in 2023, has yet to make his senior international debut for Belgium but is considered a promising long-term prospect and a potential successor to Thibaut Courtois for the national team.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has suspended the "Voice of Freedom," a military-operated radio broadcast that transmitted propaganda and outside information into North Korea. This action is the latest in a series of measures by President Lee Jae Myung's administration aimed at reducing military tensions with its nuclear-armed neighbor. The program, which first aired in 1962, broadcast world news and K-pop music to a population with strictly controlled access to information. Despite these goodwill gestures from Seoul, including the dismantling of border loudspeakers, Pyongyang has so far shown little interest in improving inter-Korean relations.</p>

          <p>A former Macy's parking structure at the iconic Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a 201-unit luxury apartment complex named Overland & Ayres. This redevelopment is part of a growing trend of repurposing defunct shopping malls to meet modern demands for housing and mixed-use spaces. The Westside Pavilion, famous for its appearances in films like "Clueless," closed in 2019 due to the decline of indoor malls. The new complex offers high-end amenities and will be conveniently located next to a new UCLA research center being built in the main mall building.</p>

          <p>Employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have overwhelmingly voted to unionize, with over 600 staffers now represented by the National Federation of Federal Employees. The successful unionization drive was spurred by recent mass firings and proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration, which have led to rock-bottom morale and fear among the workforce. While many workplace issues like low pay and poor housing predate the current administration, recent events have exacerbated frustrations. The union aims to provide job protections and advocate for employees facing depleted staffing levels and increased workloads.</p>

          <p>California's community college and state university systems are partnering with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Adobe to provide free AI training and resources to students and faculty. The initiative aims to equip the state's future workforce with essential AI skills as the technology begins to replace many entry-level jobs. While Governor Gavin Newsom praised the deals as vital for economic development, some faculty associations and experts express caution. They raise concerns about the unproven effectiveness of corporate-led training, potential data privacy issues, and the challenge of integrating these tools into curricula without undermining students' critical thinking skills.</p>
