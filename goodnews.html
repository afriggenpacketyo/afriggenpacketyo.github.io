          <h2>Bestselling Author Criticizes 'Follow Your Passion' as Worst Career Advice from Billionaires</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway argues that the worst career advice is to "follow your passion," calling it a mantra of the already rich. Instead, he advises combining something you are good at with something that has the potential to be lucrative, a strategy that led to his own success. Galloway emphasizes that resilience in the face of rejection is key, as it opens doors to greater opportunities. This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach, who recommends finding the intersection of passion, skill, and market demand for a successful career path.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is said to be an initial loan with an option to buy, which would be a positive development for United as they look to manage their wage bill. Rashford, one of the club's highest-paid players, has been training separately from the first team and was not assigned a squad number for the new season. The 27-year-old has previously stated he would like to play for the Spanish champions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang conducted a charm offensive during a recent visit to China, signaling a potential thaw in tense Sino-US technology trade relations. His trip coincided with Washington's approval for Nvidia to export a specialized, less powerful AI chip to China, and came as both nations agreed on a framework for trade negotiations. Despite the optimistic tone and increased participation of U.S. firms at a major Chinese expo, underlying fears of the ongoing trade war and technology restrictions continue to create an uncertain business environment for companies like Nvidia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Charles Schwab survey, the average American believes a net worth of $839,000 would make them feel financially comfortable. However, financial experts caution that net worth can be a misleading metric, as it provides only a snapshot of one's financial position and doesn't account for cash flow or lifestyle. Planners suggest that true financial comfort is more emotional than numerical, achieved when one's financial habits align with their core values, such as security or freedom. They advise focusing on goals and values rather than fixating on a specific net worth target.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims circulating on social media, there is no scientific evidence that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. Health officials and scientific studies confirm that UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen is a key protective measure. The rising number of diagnosed skin cancer cases is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased awareness, and more time spent in the sun, not sunscreen use. Global data shows that countries with high incidence rates, like Australia, also have strong public health campaigns promoting sun safety.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a move that signals a potential push for significant changes at the payment processing company. The article suggests Elliott's involvement could help restore investor confidence, which plummeted after Global Payments announced a complex and poorly received deal to acquire Worldpay. With the company's stock trading at a low multiple, Elliott may advocate for a reconstituted board to ensure better execution of the acquisition, hold management accountable, and ultimately lift the share price.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Wallabies 27-19 in a compelling first Test match in Brisbane, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. The Lions established a dominant 24-5 lead early in the second half with powerful and precise play, but then struggled in the final 30 minutes as Australia mounted a comeback. Despite the late pressure from the hosts, the Lions held on for the victory. While the win was secured, the team's late-game performance dip suggests they have areas to improve upon before the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>In a historic move, the U.S. has enacted its first major cryptocurrency legislation, signed into law by President Trump, who has vowed to make America a crypto leader. The GENIUS Act establishes new rules for stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market, mandating reserves and anti-money-laundering protocols. This signals a significant shift from the government's previous hands-off approach and has been celebrated by the industry, with crypto market valuation hitting a record $4 trillion. However, critics argue the new rules are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying. (not investment advice)</p>

These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as in honor guards and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, providing a living connection to military heritage. While the Army has not used horses in combat since 1942, their stately presence in rituals is considered a vital and poignant tribute. The move is expected to save about $2 million annually from the Army's $185 billion budget.</p>
