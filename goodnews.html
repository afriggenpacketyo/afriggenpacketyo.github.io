          <p>The U.S. Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade celebrating its 250th birthday, coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The event, expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, has drawn scrutiny due to its resemblance to a grand military parade sought by Trump during his first term. The parade will feature a historical reenactment of the Army's evolution, with soldiers in period costumes, vintage equipment, and flyovers, but the Army will be responsible for any damage to roads and will house troops in unused federal buildings. Significant security measures are being implemented, designating the event as a "national security special event."</p>

Irsay was known for his outspoken nature, love of football, and his music and sports memorabilia collection. Irsay had battled health issues and addiction in recent years but remained an active figure in the NFL. The Colts' chief operating officer announced that Irsay died peacefully in his sleep.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters following a judge's ruling that deemed the Trump administration's takeover "null and void." The ruling by U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell invalidated President Trump's executive order declaring USIP "unnecessary" and terminating its leadership and staff. The legal battle ensued after representatives from DOGE, led by Elon Musk, seized control of the institute's headquarters, prompting USIP leaders to sue the government.
