          <p>Servite's sprinters displayed exceptional speed at the Southern Section track and field championships, with Benjamin Harris winning the 100-meter race in 10.32 seconds and the 200-meter race in 20.96 seconds. The team also won the Division 3 4x100-meter relay in 40.43 seconds. Despite Servite's success in sprinting events, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame secured the Division 3 team title due to their depth in field events. Other notable performances included Rodney Sermons of Rancho Cucamonga winning the Division 1 100 and 200, and Evan Noonan of Dana Hills breaking his own record in the Division 1 1,600 meters.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a tight presidential election that could determine the future of its centrist government and influence the country's stance on abortion and LGBTQ rights. The election pits pro-EU Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, with foreign policy and social issues taking center stage. A victory for Trzaskowski could enable the governing coalition to fulfill its campaign pledges, while a win for Nawrocki could paralyze the government. The outcome is crucial for Europe, as Poland has become an important voice on NATO's eastern flank against Russian aggression, and the election could impact the continent's anti-democratic, populist trend.</p>

          <p>A local government in China has detailed the punishments for a 20-year-old man surnamed Liu who refused to serve in the military due to personal preference. Liu, who had voluntarily signed up and been assigned to an armed police force, repeatedly requested to leave, leading to his expulsion from the army. As a result, he is now banned from working as a civil servant or for state-owned enterprises, must pay a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300), and faces restrictions on international travel, studying, opening a business, and accessing preferential loan policies for two years.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, creating near-zero visibility conditions and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings, including the first-ever such warning for Chicago. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was caused by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland, a phenomenon known as a haboob. The event disrupted travel, with visibility dropping to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport, and evoked memories of the Dust Bowl era, highlighting the region's exceptionally dry soil conditions.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler surged to the lead at the US PGA Championship after a third-round 65, positioning himself as the frontrunner heading into the final round. Scheffler's strong finish, including an eagle and two birdies in the final five holes, gave him a three-stroke lead over Alex Nor√©n. Scheffler, who has one victory so far this season after recovering from a hand injury, aims to capitalize on his position and secure a major tournament win. Only four players this century have won the US PGA Championship after coming from three or more behind at the 54-hole stage, making Scheffler's lead particularly significant.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of murdering their parents, have gained a new generation of supporters due to shifting public opinion influenced by pop culture, particularly TikTok, Netflix, and advocates like Kim Kardashian. New evidence about alleged sexual abuse and a Netflix drama have reshaped public perception, leading to reduced sentences with the possibility of parole. The changing views reflect a growing understanding of trauma, sexual abuse, and a shift away from the tough-on-crime mentality of the 1990s, potentially influencing the California Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom's decisions regarding their fate.</p>
