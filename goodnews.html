          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, a green card holder, had been detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, criticizing his detention as "highly unusual." Khalil expressed relief at being able to reunite with his wife and newborn son, while officials from the White House and Department of Homeland Security voiced their intent to appeal the decision. The case highlights ongoing tensions between immigration enforcement and civil liberties. </p>
