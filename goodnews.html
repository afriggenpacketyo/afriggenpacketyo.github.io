        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Singapore Grand Prix has been declared Formula 1's first-ever 'heat hazard' race by the governing body, the FIA, due to predicted high temperatures and humidity. This new designation, triggered when temperatures exceed 31°C, means teams may utilize special cooling vests for drivers. The rule was introduced following the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix where extreme conditions led to several drivers experiencing severe heat stress. While using the vests is optional, teams must fit the system to all cars to ensure fairness in vehicle weight.</p>

It also highlights Arsenal's significant comeback win against Newcastle as a potential catalyst for a serious title challenge. The article strongly praises American player Christian Pulisic, arguing his current performances for AC Milan, marked by creative brilliance and goal-scoring, establish him as the best male American soccer player of his generation, operating at an unprecedented level.</p>

          <p>Japanese rookie Roki Sasaki delivered a stunning performance in the Dodgers' National League wild-card series, effectively cementing his position as the team's closer. In a perfect inning, the 23-year-old threw six of seven fastballs faster than 100 mph and struck out two batters with a devastating forkball. This display of power and precision provided a crucial sense of stability to a previously unreliable bullpen. While team management remains officially non-committal, Sasaki's performance has been hailed by teammates and fans as the definitive answer to the team's late-inning pitching problems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund improvements. The investors argue the plan is the fastest way to turn around the troubled utility without requiring taxpayer money. However, the plan is contingent on adjusting what the lenders call unachievable performance targets, a point of contention for consumer advocates.</p>

          <p>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has described the tokenization of real-world assets like stocks and real estate as an unstoppable "freight train" that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. He predicts most major markets will establish regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets within the next five years, making it the default method for gaining exposure to assets like U.S. stocks internationally. Tenev believes this technological shift will merge the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, citing stablecoins as an early example of this convergence. This trend is gaining traction with institutional giants like Morgan Stanley and BlackRock also showing interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has weakened to a Category 1 storm after lashing Bermuda with powerful winds and heavy rain. The storm, which had reached Category 2 strength, passed the archipelago and is continuing its path into the Atlantic, where it is expected to dissipate further. A hurricane warning for the islands has been lifted, though a tropical storm warning remains in effect. While hurricane-force winds were recorded, there have been no immediate reports of significant damage, though swells from the storm are causing life-threatening surf conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A growing number of higher education faculty are incorporating generative AI into their work for tasks ranging from curriculum development to administrative duties. Research from AI company Anthropic found that professors are using tools like its chatbot, Claude, to brainstorm lesson plans, conduct research, write grant proposals, and even grade student work. The data suggests that while AI is used to automate tedious tasks, it is often used collaboratively for more creative work like course design. This trend has sparked debate, with some educators expressing concern about AI devaluing student-professor relationships and the integrity of assessments.</p>

          <p>The NFL's special teams play has become a more significant factor in game outcomes due to recent rule changes, particularly the new kickoff formation. This season has seen a dramatic increase in kickoff return yardage and a sharp decrease in touchbacks, forcing more strategic kicking and coverage. The changes have also seemingly energized the entire kicking game, with a notable increase in blocked punts and field goals. While some find the new kickoff setup contrived, it has successfully injected more action and scoring opportunities, putting the 'foot' back in football.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the world's most powerful storms this year, resulted in zero fatalities on the Chinese mainland due to extensive and proactive preparations. Authorities in southern China, particularly in the tech hub of Shenzhen, spent days preparing for the storm's arrival. These measures included evacuating over one million people, opening hundreds of temporary shelters, and deploying thousands of rescue personnel. This successful outcome stands in stark contrast to previous deadly typhoons, highlighting significant improvements in the country's disaster response and management systems.</p>

          <p>China's government has clarified its standards for what qualifies as a "domestically made product" for government procurement, a move aimed at reassuring foreign companies. Effective January 1, goods meeting the "Made in China" criteria will receive a 20% price preference in contract bidding. The new rules state that companies of all ownership types—state-owned, private, or foreign—will be treated equally, provided their products meet a prescribed threshold for the cost of domestically produced components. This policy mirrors practices in the U.S. and E.U. and is intended to create a more transparent and predictable business environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back or stiff neck is often a result of improper sleep posture, which creates gaps between the body and the mattress, causing muscles to tense up overnight. Medical experts recommend focusing on spinal alignment, aiming to keep the body in a straight line from head to tailbone. This involves choosing the right pillow loft for your sleeping position—back, side, or stomach—and using smaller pillows to support any gaps under the knees or between the hips. Sleeping on one's stomach is generally discouraged as it can easily strain the neck and back.</p>
