          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union has named Steve Tandy as the new head coach for the men's national team, with his contract extending until at least the 2027 World Cup. Tandy, a former Ospreys coach, leaves his role as Scotland's defence coach to lead his home country. He faces the significant challenge of rebuilding a team that recently hit a record low of 14th in world rankings and endured an 18-match losing streak, aiming to restore their competitiveness on the international stage.</p>

          <p>In a personal opinion piece, an author reflects on nearly 45 years of life in her Los Angeles home, centered around the joy and memories tied to her small garden. She contemplates the inevitable decision to downsize, drawing parallels with her mother's reluctance to part with a lifetime of possessions. The essay poignantly explores the tension between the desire to live lighter and the deep, sentimental attachment to a place where life, much like the garden's flowers, has flourished over decades.</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep dive into the burgeoning luxury dog wellness industry in Los Angeles, where pets are treated to human-grade spa services. Following a golden retriever named Dug, the piece showcases treatments like blueberry facials, reiki meditation, and hydrotherapy, which can cost hundreds of dollars per session. The trend reflects a growing humanization of pets, with owners increasingly focused on preventative care and mirroring their own self-care routines for their canine companions.</p>

          <p>A nonprofit organization, Dog Coalition Los Angeles, is tackling the city's animal shelter overpopulation crisis by creating a robust support system for foster homes. The volunteer-run program carefully matches larger shelter dogs with foster families and provides ongoing training, guidance, and social events. This approach not only improves the dogs' chances of adoption by making them more adaptable but also fosters a strong sense of community and friendship among the human participants.</p>

          <p>A simple legislative change—deleting five words from a 50-year-old federal law—could significantly ease the U.S. housing crisis. The rule requires manufactured homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that adds cost, limits design, and creates zoning hurdles. Advocates argue that removing this mandate, which is now being considered by a Senate committee, could scale up production of this affordable housing type, offering relief to first-time buyers and those looking to downsize.</p>

          <p>The British government is relaunching the Pensions Commission to address warnings that future generations of retirees will be financially worse off than today's pensioners. New analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension, creating a significant savings gap. The commission, which first led to the creation of automatic enrollment, will now seek to build a consensus on a new strategy to boost private retirement savings.</p>

While the league has reported annual losses, key indicators like franchise valuations, broadcast rights, and overall revenue have grown substantially, fueled by rising stars like Caitlin Clark. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far below their male counterparts in the NBA, prompting questions about the league's accounting and whether players are receiving their fair share of the sport's growth.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "power law" principle, a key concept guiding venture capital investment strategy. The law dictates that a small number of highly successful investments generate the vast majority of a fund's returns, outweighing all losses and smaller exits combined. Because of this, VCs focus on identifying startups with "outsized-outcome potential"—those that can become massive, category-defining companies—rather than those with more modest growth prospects, as they seek the rare outliers that deliver transformative returns.</p>

The scramble by American firms to secure these magnets highlights the U.S.'s heavy reliance on China, which dominates an estimated 90% of the global market. (not investment advice)</p>
