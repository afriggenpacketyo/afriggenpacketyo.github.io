          <h2>Thailand and Cambodia Reaffirm Ceasefire Following China-Mediated Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 04:41:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have reaffirmed a fragile ceasefire after several days of deadly border clashes that displaced over 260,000 people. The agreement was tested by initial reports of gunfire, but a subsequent meeting in Shanghai, brokered by China, appeared to calm tensions. Both nations expressed their commitment to the ceasefire and thanked China for its role in de-escalating the conflict. The fighting, which began after a landmine explosion, is the latest flare-up in a long-standing border dispute, with the United States and Malaysia also involved in diplomatic efforts to restore peace and stability to the region.</p>

          <p>Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice for artificial intelligence, a move that Meta recently declined to make. While endorsing the guidelines to promote access to AI tools in Europe, Google also expressed concerns that the EU's AI Act could potentially slow innovation and harm the continent's competitiveness. In contrast, Meta's global affairs chief had previously criticized the code as an overreach that would "stunt" the industry. The EU's guidelines are designed to help companies comply with the landmark AI Act, focusing on transparency, safety, and security for general-purpose AI models.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool Winger Luis Diaz Completes Transfer to Bayern Munich in £65.5m Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 04:18:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to German champions Bayern Munich for a fee of £65.5 million. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract, ending his successful three-and-a-half-year tenure at Anfield where he won the FA Cup, EFL Cup, and the Premier League. Diaz was a key player for Liverpool, known for his dribbling ability and goal-scoring, contributing 41 goals in 148 appearances. His departure leaves a significant role to fill on Liverpool's left flank, with players like Cody Gakpo and new signings potentially stepping up next season.</p>

          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has announced a major contract worth $4.3 billion to supply batteries to an undisclosed corporate client, with the deal running until July 2030. While the company has not named the counterparty due to business confidentiality, reports suggest it is with electric vehicle maker Tesla. This agreement is one of LG's largest for lithium iron phosphate batteries and is expected to bolster its position in the U.S. energy storage market. The deal comes as LG expands its U.S. manufacturing presence, including a new plant in Arizona set to produce the same type of batteries.</p>

          <p>Australia's annual headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below market expectations. This figure places inflation near the bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%-3% target range, strengthening the case for an interest rate cut. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which offset price rises in housing and food. While the RBA has held its policy rate steady to confirm the downward trend, analysts now widely expect a 25-basis-point cut at the upcoming August meeting to support a softening economy.

          <p>The Australian government has mandated that YouTube and other social media platforms must ensure users are at least 16 years old, a reversal of its previous exemption for the video-sharing service. The new rules, effective from December 10, are part of world-first laws aimed at protecting children from online harms like addictive design features and exposure to inappropriate content. Platforms face fines up to AU$50 million for non-compliance. While YouTube stated the decision reverses a prior commitment, the government cited research showing YouTube was a significant source of harm for Australian children, emphasizing its commitment to their well-being.</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS posted a second-quarter net profit of $2.4 billion, doubling the figure from the previous year and surpassing analyst expectations. The strong performance was fueled by its investment bank and global wealth management divisions, which benefited from high market volatility. The bank's CET1 capital ratio remained stable at 14.4%, and it has completed $1 billion in share buybacks. However, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that client activity reflects a cautious "wait-and-see" attitude amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. trade tariffs.

          <p>A tsunami advisory issued for the California coast following a major earthquake in Russia prompted a range of reactions from residents, from casual curiosity to genuine concern. In Southern California, where only modest waves were expected, many beachgoers in Redondo and Long Beach remained largely unfazed, with some expressing surprise at the alert. However, in Crescent City, a Northern California town with a history of tsunamis, residents were more vigilant but not panicked, accustomed to such warnings. The event served as a reminder of nature's power, prompting some to reflect on their personal preparedness for such emergencies.</p>

          <p>A financial newsletter analyzes the recent strong performance of the UK's FTSE 100 index, which has outperformed many global benchmarks this year. However, the article argues that the index is not an accurate barometer of the UK's domestic economy. This is because its constituent companies, such as miners and international banks, derive the vast majority of their earnings overseas. The Footsie's success has been driven by its defensive and cyclical stocks, a weaker pound, and global factors, rather than the health of corporate Britain, which was more accurately reflected in the index's composition decades ago.
