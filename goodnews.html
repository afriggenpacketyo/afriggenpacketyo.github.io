          <p>Market analyst Gary Shilling suggests that the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is creating investment opportunities in India. Shilling highlights India's democratic system, English-speaking population, and booming population as key factors. As economies grow, Shilling says that more money proportionally is spent on services and less on goods, which is an advantage for India. He believes the tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies and affect the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares dipped following Warren Buffett's surprise announcement that he would step down as CEO, with Greg Abel set to take over. The board voted to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, with Buffett remaining as chairman. Despite the change, analysts expect a smooth transition and continued success for Berkshire under Abel's leadership. The move marks the end of an era for Buffett, who transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>
