          <p>President Trump announced at a U.S. Steel facility in Pennsylvania that he would be doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% in order to further secure the steel industry, claiming that at 25% importers can "sort of get over that fence," but at 50% they cannot. Trump also addressed the Nippon merger, stating that Nippon has committed to keeping U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of ten years with no layoffs or outsourcing. U.S. Steel workers will also receive a $5,000 bonus, and the headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, with Nippon investing $14 billion over 14 months in the company (not investment advice).</p>

Markets have tended to go down when Trump announces new tariffs, but investors have recognized that he often bluffs, buying the dip and profiting off the inevitable rally. Trump was reportedly furious when asked about the expression, indicating that the traders are right. The article suggests that Trump's commitment to tariffs is not always carefully prepared or thought through, leading to volatility in the markets (not investment advice).</p>
