          <p>Following former President Trump's threats to impose a 10% tariff on BRICS nations, Brazil and India have announced a plan to triple their bilateral trade. Trump described the economic bloc, which includes major emerging economies, as a group set up to harm the U.S. and devalue the dollar. This move by Brazil and India signals a unified front among some Global South nations to counter potential U.S. economic pressure and strengthen their own trade relationships. The BRICS group has expanded and seeks to reform Western-dominated international institutions.</p>

          <p>A new report from Airports Council International reveals that global passenger traffic hit a record 9.4 billion in 2024, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport retained its title as the world's busiest airport, processing over 108 million passengers. Dubai International Airport ranked second overall and first for international passengers, seeing its traffic climb nearly 7% above 2019 figures. The report highlights a strong recovery in air travel, though some major airports have yet to fully return to their pre-COVID passenger numbers.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Hong Kong Positioned to Fill Global Development Void Left by U.S.</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development efforts, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for providing global public goods. The author contrasts the recent dismantling of the independent USAID agency in the U.S. with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation based in Hong Kong. The piece suggests that the "America first" mentality is creating a vacuum in soft power and international cooperation. This shift presents an opportunity for Hong Kong to leverage its cosmopolitan status.</p>

          <p>NBA star Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, recently reflected on his challenging tenure with the Brooklyn Nets. In a podcast discussion with his former coach Steve Nash, Durant described the environment as chaotic, citing frequent changes in management, coaching staff, and player rosters. He felt that numerous off-court distractions prevented the team from reaching its full potential and that he never got to experience the "full Steve Nash" as a coach. Despite the turbulence, Durant also recalled his first year with the team as some of the most fun he has had in his career.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his involvement in a sophisticated cyber fraud scheme. Song is accused of recruiting North Korean IT workers who used stolen American identities to gain remote employment at global companies. The scheme allegedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars, which were then funneled to support North Korea's weapons programs. The sanctions also target four other entities and a Russia-based network involved in facilitating these illicit fundraising activities for the Kim regime.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind power capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will add at least 9 GW this year, accounting for more than half of all new global capacity. This surge is driven by strong central government support and is part of a broader strategy to promote the country's "marine economy." The expansion highlights China's growing dominance in the renewable energy sector as it develops technology for deep-sea wind farm construction.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss medication. In the post, Collins credited her weight loss to a service called Yazen, which provides prescription drugs alongside a lifestyle app. The ASA ruled that even without naming a specific drug, the advert breached rules against promoting such medications directly to the public. This was one of nine similar adverts banned by the regulator in a recent crackdown on the marketing of weight-loss treatments.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially lifted the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at all U.S. airports, ending a policy that has been in place for over two decades. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate change, citing dramatic advancements in security technology that make the measure redundant. The rule was first implemented after a failed 2001 bombing attempt. While shoes can now stay on, passengers must still remove laptops and liquids from bags, though those rules are also under review.</p>
