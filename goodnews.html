          <h2>Netflix Confirms First-Time Use of Generative AI for Visual Effects in Original Series</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:51:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has utilized generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original shows for the first time, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos. The technology was employed in the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts" to depict a building collapsing, a sequence that was completed ten times faster and at a lower cost than with traditional methods. Sarandos highlighted that AI enables productions with smaller budgets to achieve advanced visual effects. The move comes amid ongoing industry debate and concern over AI's role, which was a central issue in the 2023 Hollywood actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The space technology sector saw a significant increase in investment, with startups raising $3.1 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.1 billion in the first. According to a report from Seraphim Space, this marks the second-largest quarter for investment on record, driven by sustained interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment. U.S. firms dominated, attracting 70% of the funding, while venture capital companies remained the most active investors. The report highlights strong momentum for emerging areas like in-orbit servicing and crewed space habitats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the heat-seeking abilities of the fire beetle. This technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, which could have significant military and industrial applications. Fire beetles possess a specialized organ that can detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away, an evolutionary trait linked to their reproductive cycle. This biomimicry allows for the creation of advanced optoelectronic devices that can perceive objects through smoke, fog, or dust with remarkable accuracy.</p>

          <p>Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since the war began in October 2023. Despite facing multi-front military conflicts and domestic political turmoil, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has rebounded over 200% from its post-attack low. This economic buoyancy is attributed to strong foreign investment and a resilient, high-tech sector that constitutes 20% of the nation's GDP. Investor confidence appears to have been further bolstered by the country's perceived strengthening of its security position in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fly-half Tom Lynagh, son of Australian rugby legend Michael Lynagh, is set to make his first start for the Wallabies in a high-stakes match against the British and Irish Lions.

          <h2>Reflecting on Turning 35, an Author Concludes Most Adults are 'Winging It'</h2>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Alexander Hurst reflects on reaching the age of 35 and the realization that adulthood lacks the clear certainties he imagined as a child. He uses the French comedy series "Bref" as a cultural touchstone, comparing its depiction of a young man's chaotic life with the more complex, slower-paced realities of aging. The author concludes that the biggest lesson of adulthood is that most people are improvising their way through life. He finds value not in having all the answers but in embracing life's unexpected turns and deep relationships.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream by successfully building and operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. Zhang, who had managed a local dock for years, was inspired by a television program featuring a submarine and decided to build one himself. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the vessel. His creation has since become a local spectacle, drawing stares from villagers as he pilots it along the river, demonstrating remarkable ingenuity and determination.</p>
