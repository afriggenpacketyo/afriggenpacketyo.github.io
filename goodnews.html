          <p>Northampton Saints achieved a commanding 36-19 bonus-point victory against Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park, propelling them to the top of the Prem table. This impressive win, marked by five tries, positions them ahead of reigning champions Bath, who are scheduled to play Leicester Tigers on Saturday. Saints' victory was particularly notable as they spent half an hour of the match with a player sin-binned, yet still maintained control. Newcastle, despite brief moments of parity, remains without a league win since last November, unable to capitalize on opportunities and facing lasting frustration over their inability to convert advantages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new memoir "Future Boy," 64-year-old actor Michael J. Fox candidly recounted feeling "like a whore" during a specific day on the set of his 1985 film "Teen Wolf." He described being asked by a prop guy to pose with a chocolate bar for a confectioner, an experience he sharply contrasted with the supportive atmosphere on the set of "Back to the Future." Despite his personal discomfort, "Teen Wolf" became a significant box office success, grossing $80 million on a modest $4 million budget. The article also touches upon Fox's ongoing journey with Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in 1991, and his recent return to acting in the Apple TV+ comedy "Shrinking," where his character does not have to contend with his illness.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 750,000 vehicles across several models due to three distinct safety concerns identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Over 290,000 vehicles, including certain 2020-2022 F-250 SD, F-350 SD, and F-450 SD models, are affected by a rearview camera display issue that may impede visibility. An additional 115,539 Super Duty trucks from 2020-2021 face a potential loss of steering control due to a detached steering column upper shaft. Furthermore, 332,778 Mustang models from 2015-2017 have a seatbelt cable corrosion defect. Ford dealers will provide free inspections and repairs for these issues, which could increase the risk of crashes or injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed openness to a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, describing the idea as "interesting." Kirill Dmitriev, an investment envoy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested the project could cost $8 billion with Musk's technology and symbolize unity. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced his displeasure with the concept. The article also highlights the significant engineering challenges of building in the Bering Strait's harsh, earthquake-prone environment and notes Musk's existing business ties and past discussions with Putin on other matters.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff issued an apology for his earlier comments supporting President Trump's potential deployment of federal troops to San Francisco, where his company is based. His initial remarks, suggesting the National Guard could act as "cops" due to perceived lack of local law enforcement, drew immediate and significant backlash from local politicians and a prominent startup investor. Benioff clarified that safety is primarily the responsibility of city and state leaders, acknowledging his "abundance of caution" around the recent Dreamforce conference. The incident highlights ongoing debates about urban safety, federal intervention, and the political stances of tech leaders, prompting broader discussions about community values.</p>

          <p>Jack in the Box, the San Diego-based fast-food chain, is selling its entire stake in its subsidiary Del Taco to Fremont-based Yadav Enterprises for $115 million in cash. The transaction, which includes more than 550 Del Taco restaurants, is expected to close in January 2026. This divestiture aligns with Jack in the Box's broader "Jack on Track" revamp strategy, announced in April, aimed at strengthening the company's balance sheet and lightening its assets. Del Taco has recently faced operational struggles, including the temporary closure of nearly all its Colorado locations, prompting this strategic sale to a franchisee with extensive restaurant experience.

          <p>Instagram is implementing a new PG-13 content moderation system for all users under the age of 18, automatically restricting their exposure to content deemed inappropriate for that age group. This update expands existing "Teen Accounts" features to include "certain risky stunts" and "strong language," aiming to provide safer, age-appropriate content by default. While Meta surveyed thousands of parents who consistently expressed concerns about what their children see online, content-moderation experts question the simplistic nature of applying a movie-rating system to dynamic social media. Critics worry it might inadvertently stifle creative expression and important, context-sensitive conversations about sensitive topics for older teenagers.</p>

          <p>Honeywell is initiating a multi-stage corporate split, commencing with the spin-off of its Solstice Advanced Materials unit later this month. Shareholders of record as of October 17 will receive one Solstice share for every four Honeywell shares, with independent trading beginning October 30. This strategic move, initially advocated by activist investor Elliott Management, aims to simplify Honeywell's conglomerate structure and unlock greater value. Solstice, a mid-sized specialty chemicals business generating nearly $4 billion in sales, focuses on refrigerants, building solutions, and electronic materials. While it boasts strong margins and returns, its sales have stagnated in recent years, presenting both opportunities and challenges as an independent entity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven fully preserved skeletons discovered in a water well within the ancient Roman city of Mursa, located in modern-day Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers from approximately 1,700 years ago. Researchers believe the men, aged between 18 and 50, were likely killed during a 260 C.E. battle or subsequent skirmish for the city and were "thrown in" shortly after death. Injuries on some remains, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds from weapons, support this theory. DNA analysis indicates the soldiers were not local to the area, with origins possibly from Northern/Eastern Europe or the Byzantine Empire, providing fascinating insights into ancient military movements and the demographics of the Roman Empire.</p>

          <p>Criminal charges of felony aggravated animal cruelty have been dropped against a Florida man accused of abandoning his dog in floodwaters near a highway before Hurricane Milton made landfall. Tampa-area prosecutors filed a "nolle prosequi" notice, typically indicating a lack of sufficient evidence or witnesses to proceed with a case. The bull terrier, affectionately nicknamed Trooper by the Florida Highway Patrol, was thankfully rescued by a trooper and later adopted by a couple in the Fort Lauderdale area. This incident notably spurred new Florida legislation, signed into law this year, enhancing penalties for abandoning pets during natural disasters, reflecting significant public concern.</p>
