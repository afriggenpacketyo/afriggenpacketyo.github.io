          <p>The Federal Reserve has approved a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, placing its benchmark rate in the 4.00%-4.25% range in response to a slowing labor market despite persistent inflation. The decision, which saw one dissent in favor of a larger cut, was accompanied by projections indicating two more reductions could occur before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the move as "risk management," aiming to position monetary policy more neutrally amid ongoing economic uncertainty and rising downside risks to employment.

Key looks included Melania Trump's striking yellow banquet dress and wide-brimmed purple hat, which observers interpreted as statements of support for her husband's agenda. The Princess of Wales, Catherine, also made a notable appearance in a golden gown and the historic Lover's Knot Tiara, underscoring the pageantry and symbolic messaging embedded in such high-profile diplomatic events.</p>

The company, which spun out of a crypto-mining infrastructure firm, specializes in providing end-to-end services for AI data centers, addressing the continent's need for greater computing capacity and supporting the push for "sovereign AI." The series of high-profile deals, announced during President Trump's UK state visit, positions Nscale as a potential "national champion" for AI in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

For those whose debt obligations surpass their income, traditional repayment methods are often insufficient. This article outlines several strategies for significant debt relief, including consolidating high-interest balances into a lower-rate loan, negotiating a debt settlement for less than the full amount owed, or entering a structured debt management plan through a credit counseling agency.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, particularly for those who have already had a previous diagnosis. Researchers found that individuals who took 500 mg of the supplement twice daily after their first skin cancer diagnosis had a 54% lower risk of developing another one. The findings provide stronger evidence for dermatologists who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement as a secondary prevention measure, as it has been shown to help protect cells from UV radiation damage.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing boat that sank nearly a century ago during a storm in January 1929. The vessel went down with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found despite search and rescue efforts at the time. The discovery was made by Atlantic Wreck Salvage, whose team used sonar scans and distinctive features of the ship, like its steam engine and double drum trawl winch, to confirm its identity, bringing potential closure to the descendants of the lost crew.</p>

          <p>In his first meeting as a Federal Reserve Governor, Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter in the central bank's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point, advocating instead for a more aggressive half-point reduction. Miran, who was recently confirmed after his appointment by President Trump, is also chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. His immediate call for a larger cut signals a significant dovish stance, aligning with the President's public pressure for more substantial rate decreases to stimulate the economy.

The legislation would allow financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme, giving them more time to investigate and protect potential victims. With older Americans losing over $28 billion annually to such crimes, the proposal aims to create stronger safeguards within the financial industry to prevent these losses.

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to an issue where door trim pieces may detach while the vehicle is in motion. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the detached trim could create a road hazard for other drivers, thereby increasing the risk of a crash. The issue is related to a vehicle assembly problem, not a parts defect, and dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free. Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to this flaw.</p>
