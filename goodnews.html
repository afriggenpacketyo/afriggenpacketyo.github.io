          <p>Apple has increased trade-in prices for iPhones in China to boost demand in a crucial market where it faces stiff competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. The iPhone 15 Pro Max trade-in value has risen to 5,700 Chinese yuan ($791), up from 5,625 yuan. This move comes as Apple's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year in the first quarter, with its market share declining from 15% to 13%. Apple is also navigating supply chain concerns and potential tariffs, exploring production shifts to India, though the US government prefers domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced a 7% fall in energy prices starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This reduction will result in an annual bill decrease of ¬£129 for a typical household, reflecting a drop in international wholesale gas prices. While charities welcome the relief, many customers still struggle with energy debt, collectively owing about ¬£4 billion to suppliers. The price cap will be adjusted every three months, with analysts anticipating minimal changes by October, and the regulator is also considering changes to the system of standing charges.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is expected to stop producing new pennies following President Trump's directive to abolish the coin, citing its wasteful production costs. Trump claims the penny costs the country more than 2 cents to produce, and the US Treasury anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple since 1792, with around 114 billion currently in circulation. Advocates argue its high production cost and limited utility warrant its removal, while others highlight its usefulness in charity drives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to pause in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, after initially halting it in March. FEMA, which oversees the academy, cited a comprehensive review finding that 'certain courses provide effective training.' This reversal comes after heavy criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters, who argued that pausing training for first responders was nonsensical and dangerous. The decision marks a reprieve for Emmitsburg, where the academy is a vital part of the town's identity and economy.</p>
