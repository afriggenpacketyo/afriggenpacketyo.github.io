          <p>The Smithsonian Institution released a statement affirming its independence after President Trump announced the firing of National Portrait Gallery head Kim Sajet. The statement, issued after a Board of Regents meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts, emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary, with oversight from the Board. This comes after Trump's announcement that he fired Sajet, describing her as a partisan supporter of DEI, which he deemed inappropriate for her position. The museum also addressed concerns about biased content, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content and report back to the Board. The article provides context about Trump's executive order placing Vance in charge of removing "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian. The optimism score reflects the effort to maintain nonpartisanship. </p>

          <p>Tesla shares rose after Elon Musk shared a video showing driverless vehicles being tested in Austin, Texas, without a human safety supervisor. This comes after a feud between Musk and President Trump caused Tesla's market cap to sink.

Musk stated that Tesla will start with a small rollout, including about 10 to 20 robotaxis, with a new, "unsupervised" version of its FSD technology.
