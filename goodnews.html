          <h2>Debate Continues Over Women in Combat Roles Amidst Evolving Fitness Standards</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 14:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues as the military services adapt fitness standards. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and a graduate of Ranger School, discusses her experiences and the challenges she faced. She argues that gender-neutral standards for combat arms are important but that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. Vanasse refutes claims that standards were lowered for women, emphasizing that she met the same requirements as her male counterparts during Ranger School.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that shares of TJX, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, are a bargain after an undeserved drop following a strong earnings report.

Cramer highlights TJX's ability to maintain low prices amid rising costs for other retailers due to tariffs. JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss also raised the firm's price target for TJX, citing confidence in continued global market share gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research suggests that removing fluoride from public water would lead to a significant increase in tooth decay and dental care costs for children in the United States.

A complex plot to assassinate Grozev involved a disgraced financier and a network of Bulgarian agents. The trial and conviction of these agents mark a small victory against Russian espionage, but the broader campaign to silence dissent remains a threat. The story highlights the resources used to target Grozev and his unwavering determination to continue his work.</p>
