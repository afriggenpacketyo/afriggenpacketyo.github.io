          <p>Elissa Kalver, diagnosed with incurable HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer at age 34, shares her journey of navigating life with a terminal illness. Despite an initial prognosis of having an 80% chance of dying within five years, she has focused on "living, not just surviving." Now 38, Kalver has undergone numerous treatments, including clinical trials that successfully reduced brain tumors. She founded a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients, wrote a book, and advocates for others, all while prioritizing quality time with her family and celebrating annual "cancerversaries" to mark milestones.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chains are losing their morning customers to convenience stores, which are investing heavily in their prepared food offerings. In the three months ending in July, breakfast traffic to fast-food restaurants grew by only 1%, while visits to food-focused convenience stores like Wawa and Casey's surged by 9%. Consumers are drawn to the variety, perceived value, and quality of c-store options, which often include made-to-order items and a wider selection of beverages. This trend marks a reversal, as fast-food giants like McDonald's now look to convenience stores for strategies to boost their struggling breakfast sales.</p>

Key areas of focus will include expanding investment opportunities in emerging services and new infrastructure. The government also plans to increase support through central budget allocations and reserve a portion of government procurement contracts for small and medium-sized businesses to boost their participation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece critiques the cyclical nature of fashion, specifically targeting the potential comeback of skinny jeans. The author argues that fashion media perpetually encourages consumers to buy new versions of items they were told were outdated just a few years prior. This cycle, driven by industry greed, contributes to overconsumption and environmental pollution. The writer asserts that personal style should prioritize comfort and individual expression over chasing trends, humorously rejecting the idea of returning to a style that is physically uncomfortable and no longer suitable.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is driving significant financial gains across the tech industry through its massive investments in cloud infrastructure. Oracle recently saw a historic stock surge after revealing multibillion-dollar contracts, with a substantial portion reportedly coming from OpenAI's commitment to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years. This spending spree has also benefited Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, adding trillions to their market caps. While this fuels a tech rally, some analysts express concern about the market's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup for such substantial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Travel Experts Emphasize Flexibility as Key to Finding Affordable Airfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Google Flights and other travel experts, the single most effective strategy for securing cheap airfare is to be flexible with travel dates. Flying midweek, specifically on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays, can be significantly cheaper than weekend travel, with potential savings of around 13-14% on domestic flights. Experts also advise traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season to find better deals. The long-held myth that booking on a specific day of the week, like Tuesday, yields the best prices is largely debunked, as the day of travel has a much greater impact on cost.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine has become more complex this year, as the FDA has narrowed its approval to specific high-risk groups, including individuals 65 and older. This change from previous years, when the vaccine was available to nearly everyone, means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies. However, people with a wide range of underlying conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, or mental health issues, may still be eligible by self-attesting their risk. The CDC is expected to issue more specific recommendations soon, which could further clarify eligibility and insurance coverage for the shots.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group, a panel of scientists known for questioning the consensus on climate change. The group's report, which was heavily criticized by independent scientists for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science, was used to support the Trump administration's efforts to roll back environmental regulations. The decision to dissolve the group follows a lawsuit filed by environmental organizations alleging that its formation and report were created in secret and violated federal law. Critics argue the group's purpose was to sow doubt rather than advance scientific understanding.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is examining the complex cultural and social legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete apartment blocks that defined much of East German urban landscapes. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to postwar housing shortages, these buildings became symbols of societal transformation and, after reunification, sites of economic despair and rising extremism. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," uses art to explore these dualities, reflecting the collective memory of a generation and the painful changes that occurred within these iconic structures.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," explores the once-optimistic era of U.S.-China relations by profiling 12 influential Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States. The collection features figures from science, diplomacy, and the arts who played key roles in fostering exchange after 1979. The book's editors argue that this history of cooperation and shared interests has been lost in the current climate of intense competition and distrust. They aim to remind readers of the mutual benefits that arose from engagement, a policy now viewed with skepticism in both nations.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, driven by young people seeking better educational and career prospects abroad. Amid a challenging domestic economy and stressful work environments, many top Turkish high school graduates now opt to attend universities in Germany. This high demand has led to fully booked language courses and a shortage of German teachers in Turkey. Students and young professionals view German proficiency as a key to accessing academic freedom, a robust job market, and greater opportunities than are currently available at home.</p>
