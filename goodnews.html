          <p>Several states, including North Carolina, Missouri, Texas, California, and Utah, are undertaking mid-decade redistricting efforts that could significantly impact the composition of Congress. This push, initiated by Republicans seeking to expand their majority, has led to legal challenges and political maneuvering. In Texas, the new maps aim to create more GOP-friendly seats, while California Democrats are attempting to redraw districts to gain seats. Missouri's redistricting targets a Democratic representative, and Utah's changes are court-ordered to address gerrymandering. The outcome of these efforts remains uncertain, as challenges persist and voter behavior in the 2026 midterm elections could be influenced by various factors. </p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes rose, while Australia's ASX/S&P 200 also traded higher. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq jumped, with the country's finance ministry prepared to stabilize the foreign exchange market if needed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland CSI 300 also saw increases.

The committee pledged to face major tests and tackle difficulties, alluding to internal and external challenges to meet economic and social development goals. Officials elaborated on plans for technological upgrades and self-reliance to overcome these hurdles. The communique issued after the plenum completion hinted at the party's need to overcome challenges to meet medium- and long-term benchmarks for economic and social development.

          <p>China's energy strategy reflects a long-term vision facilitated by political stability and a governance model that ensures policy continuity, allowing the nation to embrace clean energy technologies. Western media outlets have noted China's advancements, highlighting ultra-high-voltage power lines capable of carrying more electricity than any in the United States. The Trump administration's emphasis on fossil fuels contrasts with China's commitment to decarbonizing its power grid. China aims to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Since 2021, China has rapidly increased the share of renewable energy in its total installed power generation capacity.</p>

DJ Bracken created the Utah Lunch Debt Relief Foundation, paying off debt for over 30 schools. Special education teacher Kati Jo Christensen has raised close to $30,000 through TikTok dances to erase school lunch debt. While kindness helps, Bracken believes lawmakers need to broaden free lunch access. Only nine states have permanently adopted free meals for students.</p>

The report states that Maryland U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to update him on her investigation.
