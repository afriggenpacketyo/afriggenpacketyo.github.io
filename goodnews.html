          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent commission, nearly two years after the Football Association began its investigation. The four charges, which could have resulted in a lifetime ban, alleged he deliberately received yellow cards to influence betting markets. While acquitted of match-fixing, the commission found Paqueta guilty on two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation by not providing required information. A sanction for these breaches will be determined at a later date, while Paqueta has expressed his relief and eagerness to return to playing.</p>

The existing 25% tariffs on certain goods and cars, along with 50% on some metals, will remain in place. The decision followed a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, which Trump described as "very successful." The extension provides a window for both nations to formalize a broader trade agreement, averting an escalation that could have impacted the economies of both countries.</p>

The "green apron service model" aims to improve the customer experience with faster order times and more personalized interactions.

The report will also provide updates on the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence, a key area of focus for growth. Wall Street will be scrutinizing AWS revenue, which saw slower growth last quarter, and any guidance on future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma surged in their New York Stock Exchange debut, opening at $85 after being priced at $33 in the initial public offering. This strong performance valued the company at approximately $50 billion and signals a potential resurgence in the tech IPO market. Figma, known for its web-based collaborative design tools, has over 13 million monthly users and counts major tech companies among its clients. The successful IPO follows the collapse of a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe last year due to regulatory opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Brazil also accelerated a planned tariff increase on EV kits to 35%, which will now take effect in January 2027.

          <p>A new species of stick insect, named Acrophylla alta, has been discovered in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia. Measuring 40 centimeters long and weighing 44 grams, it is believed to be the heaviest insect ever found in the country. Scientists suggest its large body mass may be an adaptation to the colder, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. The insect's remote location high in the forest canopy is likely why it remained undiscovered for so long, with specimens now added to the Queensland Museum for further study.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation and high interest rates, many pre-retirees are considering whether to roll over their 401(k) savings into an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream. While current high rates make annuity payouts more attractive, this move involves trade-offs, such as reduced liquidity and potentially high fees. The decision depends on an individual's risk tolerance, proximity to retirement, and need for predictable income versus investment growth.
