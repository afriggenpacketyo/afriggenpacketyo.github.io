          <p>Kenya has converted its $5 billion Chinese railway loans from US dollars to Chinese yuan, a strategic financial move expected to save the country $215 million annually in debt-servicing costs. Announced by Treasury Minister John Mbadi, this decision could set a precedent for other debt-stressed African nations, potentially deepening their economic and political alignment with China. The original loans from the Export-Import Bank of China were used to construct the Standard Gauge Railway, with a significant portion still outstanding. This article highlights the broader implications beyond immediate debt relief, suggesting a shift in global financial influence. (not investment advice)</p>
