          <h2>A Look at the Gen Z Activists Promoting Chastity on the Jersey Shore</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 12:00:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the efforts of Generation Life, a Christian youth organization whose members advocate for "chastity before marriage" to their peers at the Jersey Shore. The activists attempt to connect with other young people by discussing modern relationship challenges, such as the negative impact of social media, before introducing their message of sexual abstinence. The feature delves into how the concept of chastity is being framed for a generation that is already having less sex but is also largely secular and accepting of premarital relations. The group's countercultural stance aims to offer an alternative to what they see as a broken dating culture.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Ashley Kaye, a 36-year-old who left her conventional life and career in 2020 to travel the world. She now lives and travels full-time in a custom-renovated Toyota Tacoma truck, a lifestyle known as overlanding, on a budget of about $1,305 per month for essentials like food and gas. After selling her house, she invested over $50,000 into outfitting the truck with a camper, solar power, and other necessities for self-reliant travel. Kaye is currently journeying the Pan-American Highway, embracing the freedom and challenges of a nomadic life.</p>

          <p>Dutch rider Thymen Arensman secured his first Tour de France stage victory on a grueling day in the Pyrenees, giving his team, Ineos Grenadiers, its first win of this year's race. The major story of the day, however, was the withdrawal of Remco Evenepoel, who was third overall but was forced to abandon the race due to struggles on the climbs. Overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his advantage slightly by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard.</p>

          <p>British athletes enjoyed a successful day at the London Diamond League, with Georgia Hunter Bell, Charlie Dobson, and Morgan Lake all claiming victories in front of a sold-out home crowd. Hunter Bell won the women's 800m with a powerful finish, while Dobson stunned the field with a late surge to win the men's 400m in a personal best time. Morgan Lake secured the win in the women's high jump. World champion Josh Kerr finished second in a competitive men's 1500m, upstaged by Kenyan teenager Phanuel Kipkosgei Koech.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise much quicker than initially expected. While first projected to miss six weeks, Muncy is already running, playing catch, and taking swings, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting a return could be "a lot sooner than anticipated." Doctors told Muncy he was a "millisecond" away from a much more severe, surgery-requiring injury. His return is crucial for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly since their slugging third baseman was sidelined earlier this month.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships was finally presented with their gold medals at the London Diamond League. The team was upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified due to a doping confession from team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. After a lengthy process, former athletes Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton received their medals and a rousing welcome from the home crowd. The moment provided long-overdue recognition for their clean performance nearly three decades ago.</p>

          <p>The second-quarter earnings season has kicked off with a mix of strong results and cautionary outlooks, providing a complex picture for investors. While tame inflation data and solid earnings from some sectors helped support the market, some major companies like Wells Fargo and Abbott Labs saw their stocks fall after reporting. Analysts note that initial negative reactions, as seen with BlackRock, were sometimes short-sighted, failing to account for long-term growth drivers. The early results suggest investors should be cautious not to judge a company's entire quarter too quickly, as underlying strengths may be overlooked. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway claims that "follow your passion" is the worst piece of career advice, arguing that it's a luxury only the already-rich can afford. Instead of blindly pursuing a passion, Galloway advises people to find the intersection of what they are good at and what can be profitable. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on skills and opportunities, rather than a single-minded focus on a passion. This approach requires identifying one's strengths and applying them to a field that offers financial stability.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is said to be an initial loan with an option to buy, which would help United manage its wage bill and fund new signings. Rashford has been training separately from the first team after falling out of favor with head coach Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old England international has spent his entire career at Manchester United, but a move to the Spanish champions is now seen as increasingly likely.</p>
