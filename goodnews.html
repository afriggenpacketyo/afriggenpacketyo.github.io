          <p>Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood are locked in a tie for the lead at the Tour Championship, setting the stage for an intense final round. Cantlay delivered an impressive performance, carding a 64 that included a scorching back nine of 31, punctuated by four birdies in his last five holes. Fleetwood, despite finding water and taking a double bogey on the 15th, showcased resilience by immediately bouncing back with birdies on the 16th and 17th, ultimately posting a 67. The outcome carries significant weight for Ryder Cup captain's picks, with both players demonstrating top form in this high-stakes competition.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Tamil Nadu, India, in collaboration with the UK's Face Lab, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site near Keeladi. This effort aims to understand the appearance and ancestry of early inhabitants of a previously unknown urban civilization in southern India, dating back to 580 BC. The reconstructions reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration and population mixing. This discovery challenges traditional narratives about the origins of Indian urbanization, which have historically focused on the north.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich commenced the Bundesliga season with a resounding 6-0 win against RB Leipzig, with Harry Kane scoring a hat-trick, further solidifying their near-unbroken dominance in German football. This consistent lack of competition at the top has been a long-standing criticism, potentially hindering the league's global commercial and sporting appeal compared to more competitive leagues. In an innovative effort to address this, the DFL, which operates the Bundesliga, announced a new strategy for the UK and Ireland broadcast market, including granting live streaming rights for select matches to YouTube content creators. This bold move aims to attract a new generation of global fans and bridge the financial gap with other top European leagues.</p>

Draper disclosed that he had been managing the painful condition since the clay season, which intensified during the grass-court swing, necessitating a break to avert a more severe issue. Although some discomfort persists, the 23-year-old, a semi-finalist last year, affirmed he feels "ready to go" and will not hold back in his opening match against Federico Agustin Gómez. His recent participation in mixed doubles at Flushing Meadows provided crucial match practice.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing a major overhaul of sentencing guidelines in England and Wales, introducing new powers for courts to impose non-custodial penalties like bans from pubs, concerts, and sports matches. These reforms also include potential driving and travel restrictions, and orders for offenders to remain within specific geographical areas, all designed to "toughen up community punishments" and reduce reoffending. The initiative aligns with recent recommendations to decrease custodial sentences for minor offenses, thereby alleviating prison overcrowding. Offenders who violate these new conditions, or those on probation, would face further legal action and potentially mandatory drug testing, signifying a notable shift in the UK's justice system.</p>

          <p>Leading US retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are actively adapting to the escalating costs imposed by President Trump's recent tariff increases, largely succeeding in avoiding widespread price hikes for consumers. Companies are implementing various mitigation strategies, such as diversifying their supply chains, negotiating with vendors to absorb costs, and strategically adjusting prices or expanding discounts. Despite earlier concerns, the overall impact on retailers has been less severe than anticipated, with consumer spending remaining robust, although lower-income households are more sensitive to price adjustments. Many businesses are also leveraging strong brand loyalty and developing new revenue streams, like advertising and third-party marketplaces, to bolster their financial resilience amidst these economic shifts.</p>

          <p>Max Dowman, a prodigious 15-year-old talent, delivered a shining performance on his Premier League debut for Arsenal, making him the club's second-youngest player ever. Entering the match against Leeds as a substitute, Dowman immediately impressed with his weaving runs, notably winning two penalties that contributed to Arsenal's dominant 5-0 rout. Manager Mikel Arteta lauded the teenager's exceptional maturity, stability, and hunger, highlighting his remarkable confidence to perform at such an early age. Having trained with the senior squad since 14 and already excelling in youth competitions, Dowman's impactful debut suggests he is poised for further first-team opportunities, particularly amidst current injuries to key Arsenal players.</p>

          <p>Rams rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson delivered an impressive performance in his preseason debut against the Browns, immediately demonstrating why he is considered a promising successor to veteran Tyler Higbee. After recovering from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for the first two preseason games, the second-round draft pick showcased his capabilities with a spectacular 33-yard over-the-shoulder reception and a subsequent 15-yard gain from a short pass. Head Coach Sean McVay lauded Ferguson's "nice pace to his game" and expressed satisfaction with his on-field presence. This strong initial outing suggests Ferguson will be a key contributor to the Rams' tight end corps, offering both vertical speed and reliable receiving skills.</p>

Mamdani successfully raised over $1 million between early July and mid-August, largely fueled by grassroots donations, and maintains a commanding double-digit lead in a Siena poll. His platform includes proposals for rent freezes, free public transportation and childcare, and increased taxes on universities to subsidize city colleges. With $4.4 million in campaign funds and eligibility for additional public matching funds, Mamdani, despite a notable donation from a billionaire's daughter, stands as a strong frontrunner in the contentious race.</p>

          <p>Beirut's historically vibrant Hamra district is experiencing a significant cultural resurgence with the reopening of the Le Colisee cinema as the Lebanese National Theater. This initiative, spearheaded by the Tiro Association for Arts and a network of volunteers, aims to revitalize the area's cultural scene and foster unity amidst Lebanon's profound political and economic divisions. Hamra, once a bustling hub of diverse cultures and intellectual exchange, seeks to reclaim its pre-civil war "golden era," which was severely impacted by conflict and subsequent economic collapse. The theater's revival symbolizes the community's remarkable resilience and determination to invest in a shared future, even having served as an emergency shelter during recent conflicts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, significantly expanding restrictions against the Trump administration's efforts to deny federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The ruling asserts that President Trump's executive order, which aimed to cut funds for cities and counties limiting cooperation with federal immigration agencies, is likely unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass applauded the decision, while the White House announced its intention to appeal, seeking ultimate vindication. This legal development marks a crucial chapter in the ongoing conflict between federal immigration enforcement and local policies designed to safeguard immigrant communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ron Howard's latest film, "Eden," offers a melodramatic yet entertaining portrayal of human nature's darker tendencies, inspired by the true story of Europeans who attempted to establish a utopian society on a remote Galapagos island in the 1930s. The narrative depicts their idealistic experiment quickly devolving into intense power struggles and murder, serving as a raw illustration of survival-of-the-fittest dynamics. Featuring a charged ensemble cast including Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney, the article praises the film as a "sticky, sweaty hoot." While occasionally veering into the overcooked, the movie effectively captures the farcical maneuverings of isolated megalomaniacs, providing a compelling, if not entirely illuminating, cinematic experience.</p>
