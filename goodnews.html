          <p>Starbucks is exploring the sale of a stake in its China business, its second-largest market, due to macroeconomic and competitive pressures. The company has contacted private equity firms and technology companies to gauge interest in the business, which could be valued at several billion dollars. This move comes as Starbucks faces increasing competition from domestic players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee, which have significantly impacted its market share. Starbucks had over 7,750 stores in China as of March, generating approximately $740 million in net revenue during the quarter.</p>

          <p>The House is progressing on President Trump's "one, big beautiful bill," with three committees voting to advance key parts of the budget package addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities. The Ways and Means Committee, responsible for tax portions, advanced its section after nearly 18 hours of debate, though a conflict over the state and local tax deduction (SALT) remains. The Energy and Commerce Committee focused on Medicaid cuts, while the Agriculture Committee addressed food stamp changes. The House aims for a vote next week, but the Senate's input is still needed, and some Senate Republicans have expressed concerns about the House's legislation.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a 20-year-old former New Jersey high school athlete, was released by Hamas after being held hostage for 583 days in the tunnels beneath Gaza. He was captured during the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. Upon his release, he reunited with his family at an Israeli military base, where they shared an emotional embrace. Despite physical hardships, including a shoulder injury from a tunnel collapse and a poor diet, his father says Edan's spirit remains unchanged. After his release was announced, Edan was transported to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv for medical evaluation and is now reconnecting with friends and family.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled that his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested by immigration agents in March, with authorities accusing him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist." The judge refuted the government's claims that he had ties to Hamas through his wife's family, and the Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings. Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for "violence and terrorism".</p>

This move follows a previous ban on foreign-state ownership after a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator. The law change will permit State Owned Investors (SOIs), such as sovereign wealth funds and public pension schemes, to acquire stakes in UK newspapers. The Culture Secretary stated the changes would protect "media plurality" while helping publishers raise vital funding, but not everyone agrees that foreign states should be allowed to invest in newspapers at all.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived long-dormant thrusters on Voyager 1, the farthest spacecraft from Earth, before a planned communications blackout. The probe uses thrusters to keep its antenna pointed at Earth, and the thrusters had been out of action since 2004. The fix was implemented to avoid the risk of clogging in backup thrusters, which could have threatened the mission. This effort was completed just before a giant Earth-based antenna went offline for upgrades, making communication with Voyager 1 impossible until 2026. The team's success was considered a "miracle save" for the historic mission.</p>
