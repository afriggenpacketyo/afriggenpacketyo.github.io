        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the studio's worst opening weekend ever, earning only $21 million domestically and underscoring the challenges faced by original animated movies in the current market. Despite positive reviews, the film was squeezed out by competition from live-action remakes and existing franchises, while marketing may have contributed to unfamiliarity with the title. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience over time, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and plans to continue investing in original animated intellectual property. The success of animated sequels and films based on existing IP highlights a trend, but industry insiders emphasize the importance of fresh stories for the long-term health of the animation industry. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:45:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own economic interests, rather than direct military intervention. The analyst cited China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of Beijing's focus on protecting its own interests. Despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil, its response to potential disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz is expected to be shaped by economic self-interest rather than military force. </p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas such as resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need for agility and a clear-eyed sense of national interest in navigating an era of radical uncertainty. The strategy also stresses the importance of being competitive and robust in science, education, trade, and frontier technology, with the government expecting to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027. </p>

          <h2>Trump's High-Risk Strikes on Iran May Pay Off If Retaliation Ends</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:38:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Iran's retaliatory missile strike on a U.S. base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties or damage, President Trump suggested that Iran had gotten the response "out of their system." Trump expressed hope that Iran would now pursue peace and harmony in the region, signaling a potential de-escalation. This scenario raises the possibility that Trump's high-risk maneuver of striking Iranian nuclear facilities could lead to negotiations. The situation mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where limited Iranian retaliation led the U.S. to avoid further escalation, paving the way for cooler heads to prevail. </p>

In the other Group B match, PSG defeated the Seattle Sounders 2-0, with goals from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil futures experienced a significant drop after President Trump announced that Iran's retaliatory missile strikes against a U.S. base in Qatar were anticipated, easing concerns about further escalation in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude both fell nearly 9% following Trump's statement that Iran's strikes were a way to get "it all out of their 'system'." The oil market had initially surged after the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities but quickly reversed course as the retaliatory move appeared to be more symbolic than escalatory. Analysts suggest that the market's focus has shifted back to supply-demand fundamentals, with JPMorgan expecting oil to trade in the low-to-mid $60 range for the remainder of 2025.

          <p>At least 80 Labour MPs are backing an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, expressing concerns about cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote on rejecting the welfare reform bill in its entirety. Reasons for opposing the bill include the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the jobs market and people's health. The success of the amendment is uncertain, but the level of support among Labour MPs indicates the potential rebellion facing ministers. </p>
