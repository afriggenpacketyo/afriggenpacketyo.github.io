          <h2>Reasons Tariffs Have Not Yet Increased Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 14:06:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not significantly impacted inflation readings, with consumer and producer prices remaining stable in May. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the delayed effect of tariffs on the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economist Aichi Amemiya from Nomura suggests the limited tariff impact in May is due to pre-tariff stockpiling and a delayed pass-through into import prices. The expectation is that the impact of tariffs will become more evident in the coming months as existing stockpiles are depleted and companies begin to pass on the higher costs to consumers.

          <p>Debt settlement can be a viable option for individuals struggling with overwhelming debt, but it's crucial to understand when it makes sense and when it doesn't. Accepting a debt settlement offer may be wise if you've fallen significantly behind on payments and can't realistically catch up, have access to a lump sum of cash, or are considering bankruptcy. However, it's not advisable if you can still manage payments, the tax implications outweigh the savings, or you haven't explored all alternative debt relief options. Understanding your financial situation and weighing all options is essential before agreeing to any debt settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study by LendingTree reveals significant variations in tipping rates across U.S. states, with New Hampshire residents tipping the most and Utah residents tipping the least. The study indicates that tipping rates are generally higher in states where people dine out more frequently. The average tipping rate in New Hampshire is 16.07%, while in Utah it is only 4.09%. The study also highlights the increasing trend of Americans spending more on dining out, with such expenditures representing approximately 56% of their food budgets in 2023. The study also mentions that the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, meaning that tips are vital for service industry workers.</p>
