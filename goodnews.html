        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that quarterback Shedeur Sanders sought to avoid being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2025 NFL Draft. Sanders allegedly communicated his desire not to be selected by the team due to the presence of two-time MVP Lamar Jackson, which would limit his opportunities to play. The Ravens, who had considered picking him, ultimately chose another player, and Sanders was later drafted by the Cleveland Browns. He is now positioned as the third-string quarterback for the Browns, behind Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, after performing well enough to secure a spot on the final roster.</p>

          <p>The anime film “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” achieved a record-breaking opening weekend at the U.S. box office, earning an estimated $70 million. This debut marks the biggest-ever opening for an anime film in the U.S. and the highest domestic opening for any animated film so far this year. Distributed by Sony Pictures and Crunchyroll, the film significantly outperformed new Hollywood releases like “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale.” The movie is the first installment of a planned trilogy and its success underscores the growing global influence and commercial power of the anime genre in the mainstream film market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 12:04:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popularity of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is creating concern among traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor, diverting transactions that would otherwise generate revenue for credit card issuers. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. With an estimated 86.5 million Americans using these services in 2024, the trend represents a significant shift in consumer credit behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago is offering a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter Gustave Caillebotte. While his peers focused on traditional subjects, Caillebotte's work often centered on men in modern urban life, a choice that was unusual and sometimes scandalous for his time. The exhibition, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," brings together his works, including his most famous painting, "Paris Street; Rainy Day." Curators aim to integrate Caillebotte more fully into the story of Impressionism, highlighting his unique focus on masculinity, relationships, and the changing cityscape of 19th-century Paris.</p>

          <h2>New Tax Law for Tipped Workers Sparks Debate on U.S. Tipping Culture</h2>

          <p>A new law enacted under President Trump that makes tips tax-free is intensifying the debate over America's tipping culture. While the law provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped income for certain workers, critics argue it enables employers to pay lower wages and increases pressure on consumers to tip more frequently. The article questions the eligibility criteria for the tax benefit, which includes professions like electricians and digital content creators but excludes others like postal workers and teachers. The author suggests that instead of incentivizing tips, the focus should be on ensuring employers pay a fair living wage.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out an AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, audio summaries of product information. The system uses a large language model to generate scripts by pulling data from product catalogs, customer reviews, and other web sources. While the feature aims to simplify the shopping experience and improve accessibility for visually impaired customers, it also raises questions about its effectiveness. Critics are concerned that by blending marketing language with genuine user feedback, the AI summaries could lose the nuance and unique insights found in individual customer reviews, potentially misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>Team Europe's Ryder Cup golfers, including Rory McIlroy, are using an unconventional training method to prepare for the hostile crowd expected at Bethpage in New York. Captain Luke Donald has provided players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights and sounds of the event, complete with shouted abuse from virtual fans. The goal is to desensitize the players to the intense pressure and name-calling they anticipate facing on American soil. McIlroy confirmed he encouraged the simulation to be as harsh as possible, viewing it as a critical part of their preparation to defend the cup.</p>
