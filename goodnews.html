          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a Trump appointee who led the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for four months, has announced his departure, stating his mission to reform the agency is complete. Under his leadership, the MCC shifted its focus from traditional foreign aid towards strategic investments designed to yield returns for the United States and counter Chinese influence. This "America First" approach reframed the agency's projects, such as infrastructure development in Nepal and energy initiatives in Kosovo, as tools for enhancing U.S. national security and economic leverage rather than purely developmental goals.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2 with a late penalty, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim but failing to conceal significant issues with the team's goalkeepers. Recent matches have seen costly errors from both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana, highlighting a vulnerability that is undermining the team's stability. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers, suggesting the entire team is struggling with the scrutiny surrounding the club. The persistent mistakes may accelerate the club's rumored pursuit of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens before the transfer deadline closes.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which signaled the country's decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. A decade later, the nation is assessing the complex legacy of this policy, which has profoundly reshaped its society, politics, and demographics. While data shows significant progress in employment for refugees who arrived during that period, challenges related to integration and higher unemployment rates among migrants persist. The anniversary has reignited national debate over immigration policy, with current political leaders offering more critical perspectives.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to protect cattle, U.S. government biologists are testing drones equipped with loudspeakers that play sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and movie clips to scare away gray wolves. This nonlethal hazing technique is being trialed in high-conflict areas near the California-Oregon border as wolf populations recover and increasingly interact with ranching operations. While early results show success in interrupting wolf hunts, questions remain about whether the predators will become accustomed to the noise. The high cost and operational challenges of the technology also present hurdles for widespread adoption by ranchers.</p>

          <p>British F1 enthusiast Brandon Burgess is undertaking an ambitious challenge to attend every race in the 2025 Formula 1 season on a strict budget of £20,000. The 29-year-old is documenting his journey across five continents, aiming to prove that following the sport can be more accessible than its expensive reputation suggests. By strategically using his 28 days of annual leave, staying in budget accommodations like capsule hostels, and managing costs carefully, he has remained on track financially through the European leg of the season. His quest now faces its toughest test with a series of costly flyaway races remaining.</p>

          <p>The recent imposition of 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian goods has created a new impetus for India and China to improve their strained relationship, with talks between their leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit marking a potential turning point. Both nations, facing economic pressure from Washington, see mutual benefits in strengthening ties, despite long-standing border disputes and geopolitical rivalry. Analysts suggest this strategic realignment could reshape global trade flows, as India rediscovers the utility of non-Western forums like the SCO to build solidarity within the Global South.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a major upset at the U.S. Open, defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set thriller to advance to the fourth round. After losing the first set, Auger-Aliassime mounted a strong comeback, winning a critical second-set tiebreak that shifted the match's momentum decisively. The victory marks a significant return to form for the 25th seed, who has struggled with injuries and inconsistent results in recent seasons. For Zverev, the loss represents his earliest exit from the tournament in seven years and a disappointing end to his summer hard-court season.</p>

          <p>During the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping is actively positioning China as a source of "stability and certainty" in a turbulent world. In meetings with world leaders, Xi has emphasized that multilateralism and cooperation are the correct paths to addressing global challenges, framing the SCO as a key platform for this vision. This diplomatic push is seen by analysts as an effort by Beijing to assert its leadership and build solidarity, particularly among nations of the Global South, amidst rising geopolitical tensions with the West.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion, the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing.

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has stated his ambition to build a transaction system for virtual assets that could eventually surpass the volume of the traditional SWIFT network. He predicts that Tron's transaction volume, already expected to reach $8 trillion this year, could grow exponentially within the next five years. Sun's confidence is rooted in the increasing use of the Tron network for stablecoin transactions, which he argues offer near-instant settlement compared to the days it can take for SWIFT to process payments.

          <p>The USC Trojans began their football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the team's highest point total in a game since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime, while the offense showcased its explosive potential with several long scoring plays. The defense also put on a strong performance, recording five sacks and an interception returned for a touchdown. While the lopsided win provided a confident start, the lower level of competition leaves questions about how the team will fare against tougher opponents.</p>
