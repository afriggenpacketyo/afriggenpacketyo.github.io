          <p>Porsche is facing significant challenges due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, declining sales in China, and a struggling electric vehicle strategy. The company's CEO, Oliver Blume, described the situation as a "violent storm," leading to a scaled-back forecast for the year and expected drops in profit margins. Porsche is also consolidating production and eliminating jobs to lower overhead costs, while reassessing its electric vehicle goals and reintroducing combustion engine models. Despite these challenges, Porsche's strong brand reputation and history of adaptation provide some resilience in navigating these turbulent times. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, brought by over a dozen states, challenges Musk's authority to issue orders within the Executive Branch outside of DOGE. Musk, who had heavily focused on the initiative, recently stated he would reduce his time spent on it to focus on other business ventures, acknowledging the difficulty of improving the federal bureaucracy.

          <p>New calls to revive the cancelled Constitution Pipeline project pit Republican President Donald Trump against Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, with Coterra Energy potentially benefiting. The pipeline, originally championed by Cabot Oil & Gas (now Coterra), aims to transport natural gas from Pennsylvania to New England. Coterra CEO Tom Jorden highlighted the potential for long-term volume delivery if the pipeline is built. The company is shifting its focus towards natural gas due to positive macro conditions, with analysts predicting a robust future for gas. (not investment advice)</p>
