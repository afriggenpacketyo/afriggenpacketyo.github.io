          <p>Iowa Hawkeyes head coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a significant career milestone, tying Woody Hayes for the most all-time wins by a Big Ten football coach with his 205th victory. The win came in a 34-7 season opener against Albany, where the Hawkeyes' offense was led by running back Xavier Williams, who rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown. Ferentz, known for his humility, reportedly downplayed the achievement after the game, focusing instead on the team's performance.</p>

Although the opponent was not a top-tier competitor, both the offense and the revamped defense, which recorded five sacks, showed promising signs for the season ahead in a game that quickly turned into a blowout.</p>

          <h2>Non-Alcoholic Beer Sales Surge in Germany as Traditional Beer Consumption Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 20:59:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall beer sales in Germany have fallen to their lowest level in over 30 years, the popularity of non-alcoholic beer is booming, with sales more than doubling since 2013. This trend reflects a shift in drinking habits, particularly among younger, more health-conscious consumers who see alcohol-free options as a viable alternative. Breweries are adapting by marketing these beverages at sporting events, though traditional full-strength beer remains dominant in cultural settings like folk festivals, indicating a gradual rather than a radical change in consumption.</p>

          <p>A decade after the acrimonious split between famed creator Hideo Kojima and publisher Konami, the Metal Gear Solid series is returning with a remake of its third installment, "Metal Gear Solid Delta." The original series was groundbreaking for its cinematic style and complex themes, and its future was left uncertain after Kojima's exit in 2015. The remake taps into the growing market for modernizing classic games, with early impressions suggesting it is a faithful recreation that retains the original voice acting and core gameplay, raising hopes for the franchise's revival.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," which combines elements of "Married at First Sight" and "Survivor." Hosted by Davina McCall, the series matches couples who, after a brief meeting, are sent to a remote tropical island to see if their relationship can survive harsh, stripped-back conditions with minimal amenities. Contestants suggest the show's appeal lies in its authenticity and the focus on building a genuine connection through shared adversity, away from the superficiality of other dating formats.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the UK are employing an innovative arsenal, including drones, sniffer dogs, and atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, a major threat to the nation's forests. The invasive pest, which has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe, is now being carried to the UK on the wind. This high-tech approach has successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southern and eastern England, though the threat is expected to grow as climate change stresses trees and aids the beetle's spread.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic road map for international relations in a world struggling with geopolitical complexity. As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo can champion a "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation. This approach, leveraging the growing influence of middle powers, could serve as a practical model for a dysfunctional international system that is often paralyzed by competing national interests.</p>
