          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advocates for holding Apple stock, citing its recent record rally, which he believes demonstrates the company's enduring strength despite market negativity. Cramer attributes this success to the iPhone 17 lineup's strong demand and innovative features, alongside Apple's strategic ability to monetize its vast ecosystem, such as through agreements with Google for search engine default status. He criticizes traders who attempted to time the market, missing substantial gains, and suggests that Wall Street often underestimates companies like Apple, Salesforce, and Amazon. This article underscores the importance of long-term investment in fundamentally strong companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was averted after police arrested Billy Cagle, 49, who had allegedly threatened to "shoot it up" on social media. Cagle's family alerted authorities, leading to his swift apprehension inside the terminal, though he was unarmed at the time. Officers subsequently discovered an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his parked pickup truck. Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum praised the critical collaboration between the community and law enforcement for preventing a tragedy. Cagle, identified as a felon with mental health issues, faces multiple charges including terroristic threats.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, set to turn 83 next month, has successfully completed a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive, metastasized prostate cancer. His daughter shared a video of him ringing the bell at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology, a customary symbol of finishing cancer treatment, with the caption "Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff." Biden's May diagnosis revealed prostate cancer with a high Gleason score of 9 and bone metastasis, placing him in an aggressive risk category. While this marks an encouraging step, the article indicates further assessments are required to determine if additional treatment will be necessary.</p>

Official analyses published in the journal E-Government outline a future that includes robot companions and even robot children. The article acknowledges that Chinese officials and experts are keenly aware of significant potential negative impacts, such as mass unemployment, erosion of family structures, intensified human-machine conflicts, and ethical upheaval. Consequently, they are proactively planning mitigation strategies to navigate these complex societal challenges while reshaping China's global standing.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated that European troops are "ready to deploy" to Ukraine within weeks, provided a ceasefire is secured between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This announcement follows a surprise call between the two leaders, who are planning to meet in Budapest, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not been invited. Healey stressed that Ukrainians must ultimately decide the terms of any peace negotiations. The "coalition of the willing," an alliance of 26 European nations, has developed detailed plans for a multinational force to secure Ukraine's border, with the UK anticipating spending over £100m on the mission. The article also notes the heightened risk of wider European conflict since World War Two.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's persistent calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are casting a shadow over the city's robust post-pandemic resurgence, which is significantly propelled by the artificial intelligence boom. This article highlights San Francisco's positive trends, including a 30% drop in crime rates, a 70-year low in homicides, and record-breaking venture capital funding for AI companies. Despite this economic momentum and growing optimism from local officials, Trump continues to advocate for federal intervention, a stance initially supported then retracted by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. The ongoing political tension contrasts with the city's evident recovery and burgeoning economic opportunities.</p>

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate statues, including a melted Robert E. Lee monument and a graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Stonewall Jackson, are being recontextualized as art in the Los Angeles exhibition "Monuments." Curator Hamza Walker aims to challenge the "Lost Cause ideology" by displaying these symbols of white supremacy alongside contemporary art, prompting a critical re-evaluation of American history. This article notes the exhibition stands in stark contrast to President Trump's directives to reinstall Confederate monuments. The centerpiece, Kara Walker's "Unmanned Drone," transforms Stonewall Jackson into a headless, zombie-like figure, further subverting the original glorification. The exhibition sparks important dialogue on historical narratives, racial injustice, and the evolving interpretation of public symbols.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study demonstrates that a tiny microchip eye implant, paired with specialized glasses, has successfully helped some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy regain their ability to read. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) system involves surgically placing a hair-thin implant under the retina, with special glasses then projecting images via near-infrared light to the implant. Out of 32 patients, 26 showed "meaningful improvement in visual acuity" within 12 months. This article highlights the profound impact on patients, such as a 70-year-old who can now read and do crosswords, despite the need for intense concentration. This innovation offers significant hope for the approximately 5 million people worldwide affected by this leading cause of blindness.</p>
