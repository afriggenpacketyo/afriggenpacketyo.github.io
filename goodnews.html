          <p>During a concert in San Francisco, pop star Katy Perry experienced a technical issue with a prop while performing her song "Roar." The mechanical butterfly she was riding while suspended over the audience suddenly dropped a few feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued the performance without further incident, flying through the arena before landing safely back on stage. The event is part of her "The Lifetimes Tour," which features multiple aerial stunts, and she handled the malfunction with professional composure.</p>

          <p>Actors Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell revealed their unique approach to finances after 18 years of marriage, stating that they keep their money completely separate. They contribute quarterly to a shared "community pot" for family expenses, adjusting their contributions based on who is working more at the time. This system supports their decision to always have one parent at home with their twin daughters. The couple also reflected on handling public commentary, particularly regarding Romijn's ex-husband John Stamos's memoir, with a focus on protecting their children from negativity.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a thrilling performance during the third round of the Open Championship at Portrush, electrifying the home crowd. Despite a bizarre moment where his shot unearthed a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey, he quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole. This moment generated one of the largest roars of his career and propelled him back into contention. Finishing with a round of 66, he sits six shots behind the leader but remains hopeful, giving himself what he calls "half a chance" for a victory.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of the Open Championship, heading into the final round with a commanding four-shot lead at 14 under par. Despite a brief challenge from Matt Fitzpatrick, Scheffler's steady, bogey-free round of 67 demonstrated his relentless consistency and unflappable demeanor. With a history of converting 54-hole leads into victories, his performance has created an air of inevitability around his potential win. A victory at Portrush would mark his fourth major title and place him three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy focus towards Europe, strengthening its security cooperation with France and the United Kingdom in an alliance known as the "E3." This strategic shift, marked by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is a response to the threat from Russia and uncertainty about future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized the need for Europe to become more independent in its defense capabilities, viewing the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK as a potential supplement to US protection. This move signals a pragmatic adjustment to changing geopolitical realities.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been an outcast at his current club. After being dropped by manager Ruben Amorim and told to train separately, Rashford's departure from Old Trafford has seemed inevitable. Barcelona, which has been seeking to strengthen its attack, sees an opportunity to acquire the 27-year-old England international, initially on a loan with an option to buy. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is betting on his potential to be a major asset in La Liga and the Champions League.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. The plot, known as "Operation Valkyrie," was a coup attempt by a group of high-ranking military and administrative officials who had become convinced that killing the dictator was necessary. Although the bomb failed to kill Hitler and the coup was swiftly crushed, the event has become a powerful symbol of German resistance against the Nazi regime. Historians note the conspirators' complex motives and that they were not necessarily democrats, but their actions demonstrated a courageous defiance of tyranny.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Generation Life, a faith-based group of Gen Z activists who spent a weekend on the Jersey shore advocating for chastity until marriage. The activists engage beachgoers in conversations about love and relationships, framing chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity in an era dominated by social media's superficiality. They aim to connect with their peers by discussing shared anxieties about modern dating and the pressure to perform sexually. The group's mission is to offer an alternative path focused on deeper, more intentional connections, rooted in their Christian faith.</p>
