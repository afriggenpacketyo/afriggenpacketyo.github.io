          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, scoring in three consecutive games and earning man-of-the-match honors. However, his European success contrasts sharply with his domestic form, where he has yet to score or assist in the Premier League this season. Manager Eddie Howe and Gordon himself acknowledge the challenge of translating his big-game performances to consistent weekly output. The 24-year-old's ability to find this consistency is seen as key for both his and the club's ambitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the theory that dinosaurs were already in decline before the cataclysmic asteroid strike 66 million years ago. Researchers analyzing fossils from New Mexico dated to just 400,000 years before the impact found evidence of diverse and thriving dinosaur communities. The presence of colossal species like the Alamosaurus suggests that these creatures were flourishing right up until their abrupt extinction. While significant, experts note this is evidence from one location and more global research is needed.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble exceeded Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. However, the company reported flat overall sales volume, indicating that price increases, rather than higher demand, fueled revenue growth. The consumer goods giant observed that lower-income shoppers are stretching their budgets by using products more sparingly, leading to a 2% volume decline in its home and health care segments. Despite these pressures, P&G maintained its full-year financial forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The portrayal of extraterrestrials in popular culture has evolved significantly, often serving as a metaphor for prevailing societal fears and anxieties. In the 1950s, aliens represented Cold War paranoia, while later films used them to explore themes of corporate greed, ecological disaster, and post-9/11 trauma. The article notes that the term "alien" itself carries connotations of otherness, mirroring contemporary debates on migration. It concludes by suggesting that artificial intelligence, a non-biological and often inscrutable force, represents the newest form of "alien intelligence" challenging human understanding.</p>

          <p>The official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army, the PLA Daily, has emphasized that political loyalty and combating corruption are critical to China's ability to win wars. The editorial follows a recent Communist Party meeting that endorsed an ongoing anti-corruption campaign within the military. The article states that the armed forces "must not be a hiding place for corrupt elements" and calls for strengthening political indoctrination. This push for integrity is framed as a necessary component of China's broader military modernization and efforts to build advanced combat capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Liverpool Manager Not Concerned by Mohamed Salah's Recent Goal-Scoring Form</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 07:59:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has expressed confidence in forward Mohamed Salah, despite the player's recent dip in goal-scoring form. Salah, the team's top scorer last season, has only scored three league goals this term, his longest stretch without a non-penalty goal since joining the club. Slot attributes the slow start to various factors, including adjustments to new summer signings and the departure of key teammates. The manager stated that worrying about Salah's ability to score is "the last thing" on his mind, expecting the prolific winger to return to form soon.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has issued preliminary findings that TikTok and Meta are in breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU's landmark technology regulation law. The companies are accused of failing to provide researchers with adequate access to public data, which hinders the study of potential risks associated with their platforms. Meta was also cited for not providing simple mechanisms for users to report illegal content and challenge moderation decisions. If the findings are upheld, the firms could face substantial fines of up to 6% of their global annual turnover.</p>

          <p>A recent robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves stole jewels valued at approximately $102 million, has been described as both a "terrible failure" by officials and a thrilling, quintessentially French caper by others. The burglars exploited a significant security oversight in the Apollo Gallery, which was monitored by only a single, poorly angled outdoor camera. While fleeing, the thieves left behind a trail of equipment and DNA evidence, suggesting a less-than-perfect execution. The article argues that such crimes, while embarrassing for the institution, often increase the fame and public fascination with the stolen artworks.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached a historic high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a new report from Hedge Fund Research. This growth was driven by the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital from investors in 18 years, combined with strong investment returns during the third quarter. The industry's main composite index gained 5.4% in the quarter, buoyed by successful bets on technology, artificial intelligence, and rising M&A activity. Analysts expect institutional investors to continue allocating capital to hedge funds to navigate geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
