          <p>Pfizer announced a significant deal to acquire weight loss drug developer Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, including future contingent payments, as it intensifies efforts to secure a share in the booming obesity drug market. This strategic acquisition follows a series of setbacks for Pfizer in developing its own obesity treatments, with prior candidates being scrapped due to safety concerns. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed positive early-stage trial results, with analysts projecting over $5 billion in combined peak annual sales. The deal, expected to close by year-end, is poised to accelerate Pfizer's presence and competitiveness against established rivals, leveraging its deep cardiometabolic experience and manufacturing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>China achieved a significant military milestone with the successful launch of its J-35 stealth fighter jet from the Fujian aircraft carrier, marking the first time this advanced aircraft has taken off from such a vessel. This landmark operation confirms the Fujian's attainment of electromagnetic catapult and recovery capabilities, representing a major technological breakthrough in China's aircraft carrier development. The J-35 is now recognized as the world’s second carrier-based stealth fighter, following the Lockheed Martin F-35 series. This development substantially enhances the power and operational reach of China’s naval air wings, signaling a new era for its maritime defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The project involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, potentially increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While welcomed by the Chancellor for economic benefits, the plan faces strong opposition from environmental groups who argue it ignores climate science and will exacerbate pollution. Stricter noise controls and public transport targets have been agreed upon to mitigate local impact, though critics are considering a judicial review.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping indicates a shift towards a "managed rivalry" between the two global powers, prioritizing accommodation over escalating tensions. Despite a history of strategic competition and the Trump administration's imposition of high tariffs, both nations acknowledge their profound mutual economic dependence. This pragmatic acceptance is deemed essential for global stability, as an all-out conflict would be mutually devastating. The conversation, described as "pragmatic, positive and constructive" by China’s People’s Daily, suggests an evolving framework for cautious competition in their economically asymmetric relationship.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's new mutual defense pact with Pakistan is unlikely to disrupt Riyadh's established energy relationship with India, a major crude oil consumer, according to a senior source familiar with the matter. The source emphasized that Saudi Arabia seeks to bolster its security by diversifying alliances without sacrificing its vital commercial ties. India, a key customer, consistently receives over 600,000 barrels per day from Saudi Arabia, remaining one of its top suppliers. Despite India's long-standing conflict with Pakistan, the agreement is understood as serving national priorities. Furthermore, long-running speculation about a shift away from the U.S. dollar for Saudi oil trade was dismissed as a "phantom agreement." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the pervasive self-help industry, questioning whether its focus on individual betterment might inadvertently be making people feel worse by fostering isolation. Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro, drawing from her book "Promise Land," argues that while the appeal of self-optimization is strong, the obsession with productivity and individual improvement often neglects the crucial aspect of community. She suggests that by solely focusing on "self-help," individuals miss opportunities to strengthen relationships and build communal support, which are vital for well-being. The article posits that while some self-help can be beneficial, an overemphasis on it can detract from collective human connection.</p>

Despite these public displays, Reid stated he was "OK with that," attributing it to Kelce's competitive drive and commitment to winning, while acknowledging his role as "the policeman."

Beijing had previously halted contacts in 2022 in protest of a visit to Taiwan by former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The discovery includes a unique ring-shaped ornament adorned with 37 smaller rings, described as the "most complete and complicated" of its type in Scotland.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the essential differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, crucial for investors seeking to diversify portfolios. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering real-time pricing, while mutual funds transact directly with the fund at day-end prices. Critically, ETFs are generally more tax-efficient due to "in-kind" transfers that avoid capital gains distributions, a significant advantage for taxable accounts. They also tend to have lower expense ratios. However, mutual funds offer a broader selection and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans, meaning investors may not always have a choice.

Seven out of ten family offices made direct investments in private companies, with many increasing their exposure to growth-stage ventures, driven by bullish long-term trends like AI. However, interest in startup and early-stage funding has notably declined, particularly among North American family offices, indicating a preference for less perceived risk. Opportunistic plays in secondary sales are also rising as institutional investors offload illiquid assets, leveraging family offices' reliable cash flow from operating businesses.
