          <p>A collection of articles highlights the complex and evolving nature of China's efforts to expand its global "soft power." Topics range from the waning appeal of learning Mandarin in the West to the surprising international success of "ugly-cute" toys like Labubu. These reports suggest that while China is investing heavily in cultural exports and think tanks to shape its international narrative, it also faces challenges from its global image and a perceived need to relax its grip on cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy has revealed a significant development from the recent Trump-Putin summit, stating that the Russian president agreed to allow NATO-style security protections for Ukraine. Envoy Steve Witkoff described the concession as "game-changing," as it could provide Ukraine with a collective defense commitment similar to NATO's Article 5 without formal membership. This potential breakthrough addresses one of Kyiv's core security demands and will be a central topic of discussion at the White House meeting with Ukrainian and European leaders.</p>

          <p>Bolivia appears set for its first non-left-wing president in nearly two decades, as preliminary election results show two center-right candidates leading the vote. Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president Jorge Quiroga are headed for a run-off election, signaling a significant political shift away from the incumbent socialist party. This change comes amid a severe economic crisis and deep divisions within the left, potentially leading to closer ties with the U.S. and more foreign investment in the country's lithium reserves.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Composite Index surged to its highest level in a decade, reflecting strong investor appetite for higher returns in the stock market. The rally is fueled by a belief that low bond yields and deposit rates are driving capital from other assets into equities. Despite recent data indicating a weakening in China's economic growth momentum, investors appear confident, partly due to hopes for further government stimulus measures to support the economy.

          <p>The upcoming White House meeting between Ukrainian, European, and U.S. leaders could be more critical for Ukraine's future than the recent Trump-Putin summit. European leaders are determined to present a united front to President Trump, emphasizing that any peace deal must directly involve Ukraine and include "cast-iron" security guarantees. The central challenge will be navigating a potential deal that trades Ukrainian territory for security, a compromise that would be politically difficult for Kyiv to accept after years of intense conflict.</p>
