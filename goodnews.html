          <p>President Donald Trump praised Saudi Arabia and its leaders after the White House announced a commitment by the kingdom to invest $600 billion in a series of deals with the United States. The agreements include a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing Saudi Arabia with warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to raise the U.S.-Saudi partnership to $1 trillion across military, security, economic, and technological sectors.

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government, led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, to give the country a chance at peace. Al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, assumed power after a military offensive that ended the Assad family's 54-year rule. Trump's decision came at the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who believe the new government can counter Iran's influence in Syria. This move marks a significant shift in U.S. policy and puts Trump at odds with Israel, which remains skeptical of Al-Sharaa's past.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation retreated in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, with the consumer price index rising 2.3% annually, the smallest increase since February 2021. However, economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump could reignite inflation, potentially costing the average U.S. household an extra $2,800. A 10% average tariff rate could add as much as 1 percentage point to the consumer price index after about six to nine months. There are some signs of tariff effects in the CPI report, such as a nearly 9% jump in audio equipment prices.</p>

          <p>Former FDA commissioner Dr. David Kessler warns about the unknowns surrounding long-term use of weight loss drugs and how to safely discontinue them. Kessler noted that the FDA approved these medications without a comprehensive long-term strategy. While acknowledging the potential for these drugs to transform health by reducing belly fat, which has a causal effect on cardiac and kidney diseases, he cautioned that they are not miracle pills. Kessler emphasized the need for data on safely stopping and restarting these drugs, calling the current situation a national experiment. He also stressed the importance of medical supervision, nutrition, and physical activity for long-term weight loss.</p>

          <p>Independent test results confirm that drinking water in fire-affected areas around Altadena and the Pacific Palisades is largely free of harmful contaminants, leading an Altadena utility to lift the last "do not drink" notice. The LA Fire HEALTH Study found only one home with a toxic substance, benzene, slightly above the state's allowable level, which would likely drop after flushing the lines. Experts attribute the quick restoration of safe drinking water to the hard work of local utilities and state regulators, who followed a post-fire playbook developed after previous fires. Residents are advised to flush their lines to ensure water safety.</p>
