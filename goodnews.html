        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge strongly condemned President Trump's executive order aimed at the law firm WilmerHale, declaring it unconstitutional and a threat to the American justice system's independent judiciary and bar. Judge Leon, appointed by former President George W. Bush, expressed outrage in his 73-page opinion, criticizing the administration's arguments as "absurd." The order had targeted WilmerHale for hiring Robert Mueller, instructing the attorney general to suspend security clearances and federal agencies to terminate contracts. WilmerHale sued, calling the order an "unprecedented assault" on the judicial system, and the court's decision to block the order affirms constitutional rights. The White House has yet to respond to the ruling.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently imprisoned for bank fraud and tax evasion, during a phone call with their children. The Chrisleys were sentenced in 2022 after being convicted of submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing income from the IRS. Their daughter, Savannah, has been advocating for their pardon, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status. Trump said the couple received "pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing."</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of app store users, placing new burdens on the tech giants in a bid to give parents more control over the apps their children download. Texas is the largest of 20 states that have weighed similar child safety laws for smartphones. Apple has argued that collecting age information would intrude on users‚Äô privacy and has favored its being done by individual apps. But social media companies such as Meta, Snap and X have pressed for Apple and Google to become one-stop shops where parents verify their children‚Äôs age and approve downloads.</p>
