        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade agreement, a process that was reportedly expedited by the tariff policies of the U.S. Trump administration. The deal will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and pharmaceuticals while opening investment in sectors such as electric vehicles. For Indonesia, the pact offers tariff-free access to the EU for about 80% of its exports, including palm oil and textiles. This agreement marks the EU's third such deal with a Southeast Asian nation, following those with Singapore and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>The issue of Palestinian statehood is a prominent theme at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, attended by leaders from over 140 countries. The focus has been amplified following recent recognitions of a Palestinian state by several European nations, including France and Belgium. This diplomatic shift is increasing political pressure on other countries, such as Germany, to reconsider their long-held positions on the matter. The discussions are taking place as the UN itself grapples with financial challenges and questions about its relevance on its 80th anniversary.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has granted an injunction that overturns a Trump administration stop-work order, allowing Danish renewables firm Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. The nearly completed offshore wind farm is located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. This legal victory provides a significant reprieve for the company, which has been impacted by the administration's policies against wind power projects. Following the news, Orsted's shares jumped by more than 6% in morning trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service has introduced a new patient safety initiative called "Jess's Rule," named after Jessica Brady, who died from cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed. The rule is a strong reminder for general practitioners to adopt a "three strikes and rethink approach." This means if a patient attends three appointments for the same symptoms without a clear diagnosis or with worsening conditions, the GP should reconsider the diagnosis, order more tests, seek a second opinion, or make a specialist referral to prevent avoidable deaths.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, marking a 10% increase over the same period last year. This growth has persisted despite the Trump administration's efforts to cancel or impede low-carbon projects in the United States. According to a report from the Zero Carbon Analytics thinktank, the sector continues to show strong momentum and resilience, with significant investments directed toward wind power and upgrading electricity grids, indicating that corporate and state-level climate goals remain influential.

Captain Tony Jacklin is credited with transforming the European team by demanding professional standards, including first-class travel and better team facilities, which mirrored the American approach. His leadership and successful persuasion of star player Seve Ballesteros to rejoin the team were instrumental in the historic win at The Belfry, which ignited the modern, intensely competitive spirit of the Ryder Cup.</p>

Dr. Freelander emphasizes that large, credible studies have disproven such a connection and warns that unscientific claims can cause significant distress.

The administration had previously frozen the funds, which were primarily designated for medical research projects, citing allegations of civil rights violations at the university. In granting the preliminary injunction, the judge ruled that the government likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific procedures and explanations for the funding cuts, a tactic the administration has used to pressure several elite universities.</p>

          <p>This sports analysis suggests that tactical trends in modern football are increasingly mirroring the direct, pragmatic style famously associated with manager Sam Allardyce. The article notes a growing emphasis on set-pieces, long passes from the goalkeeper, and the use of a physical striker, all hallmarks of the 'Big Sam' playbook that was once heavily criticized. As teams move away from a strict possession-based philosophy, the piece argues that Allardyce's data-driven and results-oriented approach was ahead of its time and is now being vindicated by some of the sport's top coaches.</p>
