          <h2>US Gas Prices Expected to Decline, Potentially Reaching Cheapest Summer Levels Since 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy analysts predict that U.S. gas prices will continue a slow decline throughout the summer, potentially offering the most affordable fuel costs since 2021. Following a temporary spike due to Middle East tensions, prices are expected to fall, possibly dropping below $3 per gallon by September. This trend is attributed to factors like increased refinery production, the stabilization of summer-blend gasoline costs, and softening consumer demand after early travel peaks. Despite recent fluctuations, experts note that when adjusted for inflation and rising incomes, Americans are spending a smaller portion of their income on fuel than in previous years.

          <p>Deciding whether to pay for a laundry service involves weighing convenience against cost, and financial experts suggest a structured approach to the decision. Key considerations include calculating your personal hourly rate to see if outsourcing the chore is cheaper than the value of your own time. It is also important to assess the emotional benefit; if laundry is a major source of stress, outsourcing it could improve your overall well-being and productivity. Experts also advise confirming you are comfortable with the premium price and ensuring that such convenience spending does not compromise long-term financial goals like retirement savings.

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus has stated it has "no plans to close any factory" following reports that it was considering moving production from its UK headquarters to the United States. The speculation arose after the Financial Times reported the company was reviewing its operations, which could have put 1,300 jobs in Norfolk at risk. While denying closure plans, Lotus admitted it is "actively exploring" global market options, a move prompted by the business challenges posed by US tariffs on imported cars.

          <p>England forward Lauren James is poised to make her return to the pitch in a friendly match against Jamaica after a three-month absence due to a hamstring injury. The 23-year-old Chelsea star has not played since April but has been training well and is expected to come on as a substitute. Her return is a significant boost for England's preparations as they begin the defense of their European title on July 5. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that James's minutes will be carefully managed to ease her back into game fitness ahead of the tournament.</p>
