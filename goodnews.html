        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Amazon's stock falling after its second-quarter earnings report, some analysts are maintaining a buy rating, viewing the dip as a buying opportunity. The company exceeded revenue and earnings expectations, but a slight beat from its cloud unit, AWS, and a mixed third-quarter operating income forecast disappointed investors. The core investment thesis remains intact, focusing on the long-term growth of high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising, both of which performed well. Analysts argue that management's guidance is often conservative and that continued efforts to lower e-commerce costs will expand margins, ultimately driving the stock higher.

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long desired. The $200 million addition to the East Wing will be funded by private donations, including from the president himself, with construction slated to begin in September. The new venue will seat approximately 650 guests, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity, eliminating the need for large tents for state dinners and other major events. The administration stated the project would be completed well before the end of the president's term in 2029.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant change to its civil service internship program, restricting it exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall to ensure the government better reflects the country it serves. The change will take effect in 2026, and successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the main graduate entry program. This move is part of a broader effort to diversify the civil service and establish more career paths outside of London.</p>

          <p>In response to pressure from Wall Street, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated the company will "significantly" increase its investment in artificial intelligence and is "very open" to acquisitions to accelerate its AI roadmap. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than competitors like Google and Microsoft, Cook emphasized a "hybrid" investment model and a focus on reallocating internal talent. He also downplayed the threat of new AI devices to the iPhone, suggesting they would likely be complementary rather than substitutes. The remarks confirm Apple is intensifying its efforts to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet MLB trade deadline, making modest additions rather than the blockbuster deals seen elsewhere in the league. The team acquired veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing key needs without giving up significant prospect capital. This conservative approach signals the front office's faith in its current roster to compete for a championship. While rivals like the San Diego Padres made major acquisitions, the Dodgers are betting on the return of injured players and improved performance from their existing stars to carry them through the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>FICO CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing structure against recent criticism from the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In a television interview, Lansing argued that the cost of a FICO score, which he stated is $4.95 for a mortgage, is a negligible part of home closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. His comments come after the FHFA announced that lenders can now use scores from rival VantageScore, with the agency's head calling FICO a "monopoly." Lansing countered that FICO's model is superior and that the new policy raises "safety and soundness concerns." (not investment advice)</p>

This successful debut is a welcome sign for Silicon Valley's venture firms, which have seen scarce returns from IPOs in recent years. The outcome is particularly notable as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed last year due to regulatory pressure, a turn of events that has now proven highly lucrative for its investors.

The company provided an optimistic outlook for the September quarter, projecting mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth despite anticipating over $1 billion in tariff-related costs.

          <p>The Trump administration's consideration of reviving the presidential fitness test brings back a program with a long history in American schools. Originally initiated by President Eisenhower in 1956 out of concern for national security and combat preparedness, the test typically assessed cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility through exercises like a one-mile run and push-ups. Despite its goals, the test's effectiveness in improving youth health is questionable, as data shows that child health metrics in the U.S. have significantly worsened over the decades. The original impetus for the test was a study showing American children lagging far behind their European counterparts in fitness.</p>
