          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase the salaries and improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions. This move is aimed at attracting and retaining talent amidst growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine. The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen, and chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of living in the diplomatic establishments. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasizes the significant role these chefs play in promoting Japanese food and culture internationally as "food diplomats."</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in transportation policy. The nationalized service will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. While the government hails this as a new era for rail, it refrains from promising lower fares, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment. Unions express concerns about potential outsourcing, while the opposition calls for Labour to deliver on its promises.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to King Charles III to open the Canadian parliament is seen as a message to Donald Trump and the world about Canada's sovereignty. The move is a deliberate affirmation of Canada's unique traditions and independence, countering Trump's suggestions of it becoming a U.S. state. This rare occasion, with the first British monarch delivering a throne speech since 1977, comes at a time of heightened tensions between Canada and the U.S. due to Trump's undermining of Canada's sovereignty and imposition of tariffs.</p>

Trump also touted the elimination of critical race theory from military academies and claimed a new peacetime recruiting record. However, military records indicate that enlistments began rebounding before his return to office, potentially influenced by recruitment reforms introduced during the prior administration.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors say the condition, which involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, is treatable but often underdiagnosed. Symptoms can include problems with walking, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence, which can be mistaken for normal signs of aging. Experts emphasize that early diagnosis and treatment, often involving a shunt to drain excess fluid, can significantly improve a patient's quality of life.</p>
