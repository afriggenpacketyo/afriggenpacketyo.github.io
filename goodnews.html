          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 03:08:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilders have agreed to a £100 million payment for affordable homes and committed to not sharing commercially sensitive information, effectively settling a competition law investigation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had been scrutinizing whether these firms were exchanging data on pricing and buyer incentives, potentially violating competition rules. Although the companies do not admit any liability or wrongdoing, this agreement allows the CMA to avoid a protracted legal decision. The watchdog emphasized that this resolution is a more effective way to immediately introduce hundreds of new affordable homes into the UK market than a lengthy and complex investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>All 23 British players have exited the Wimbledon 2025 singles tournaments, prompting an analysis of their performances. Jack Draper showed promise on hard and clay courts but needs more time on grass, while Emma Raducanu demonstrated her ability to challenge top players, with expectations of a swift return to the top 10. Katie Boulter's strong grass-court game was undone by a qualifier, though her improved movement and mentality suggest future Grand Slam second-week runs. Lily Kartal's fourth-round debut highlighted her potential for rapid ascent, and Cameron Norrie's quarter-final appearance marked a strong recovery in form, suggesting a trampoline effect for his hard-court game.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:18:13 EDT</div>
        </div>

          <p>Palm Beach County, Florida, has unanimously approved a resolution to rename a four-mile section of Southern Boulevard, which connects Palm Beach International Airport to Mar-a-Lago, as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." President Donald Trump expressed his appreciation on Truth Social, describing it as a "wonderful honor" and extending thanks to the county, Governor Ron DeSantis, and Florida's state lawmakers. This ceremonial renaming, which will not affect postal addresses or emergency systems, also includes a section to be named "PBSO Motorman Highway" in tribute to three fallen motorcycle deputies. The new signs are expected to be installed later this year.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," offers a fresh take on the London rom-com, drawing loosely from her own experiences and contrasting a romanticized view of England with its complex reality. As an adult, Dunham found navigating London's social cues and subtle linguistic differences particularly challenging, despite speaking the same language. The 10-episode show, produced by Working Title (known for iconic British rom-coms), stars Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe. Dunham shared that a conversation with actor Andrew Scott sparked the show's concept, which features an impressive array of celebrity cameos, creating a "non-stop parade" of engaging characters.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a 1,856-kilometer "green belt" across the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts in Inner Mongolia, marking a significant milestone in its ambitious desertification control efforts. This initiative, often dubbed a "green great wall," involved first stabilizing shifting sands using the traditional straw checkerboard method, then planting drought-resistant trees such as sacsaoul. The project aims to establish a robust sand prevention and control system, thereby substantially strengthening the ecological barrier in the region. This accomplishment represents a notable step in combating environmental degradation and promoting ecological stability.</p>

          <p>Super Micro, a leading supplier of AI servers, is set to significantly boost its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities, to meet the surging global demand for artificial intelligence. CEO Charles Liang confirmed these plans, emphasizing the tremendous and sustained growth potential in the AI sector. The company's stock experienced a significant surge following the ChatGPT boom, though it later faced scrutiny over accounting and financial reporting; these concerns have since been alleviated by the filing of delayed reports. Liang dismissed recent weaker-than-expected guidance, confidently stating that Super Micro's growth trajectory remains robust due to continuous technological innovation and expanding business scope.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' phenom pitcher Jacob Misiorowski delivered an "unbelievable" performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers, extending their losing streak to five games with a 3-1 victory. Despite the Dodgers' game plan to "stress him" and elevate his pitch count, Misiorowski, in only his fifth MLB start, recorded an impressive 12 strikeouts in six innings, tying an MLB record for strikeouts within the first five frames. Although Shohei Ohtani hit a leadoff home run, the Dodgers' lineup largely failed to capitalize on opportunities. Clayton Kershaw's solid two-run start for the Dodgers was ultimately overshadowed by Misiorowski's dominant pitching, leaving the team frustrated by their recent performance score.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a central hub for global public goods and cooperation, particularly as the US development sector, including USAID, faces significant restructuring and decline. Foreign Minister Wang Yi's attendance at the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) debut in Hong Kong underscores China's increasing proactive role in international development, aiming to fill a void left by a US administration prioritizing "America first" and viewing foreign aid as a fiscal drain. This geopolitical shift positions Hong Kong for new prominence, as the center of gravity for global development and cooperation increasingly moves eastward, aligning with the expectations of the Global South.</p>

          <p>Mandonna Kashanian, an Iranian mother who had resided in the US for 47 years, was released from ICE detention following intervention from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Detained while gardening, Kashanian had consistently checked in with immigration authorities for decades, despite a 1992 deportation order. Scalise advocated for her, emphasizing her "life's work" and community role, prompting a "second look" from Homeland Security. While DHS maintains she was "in this country illegally," her release underscores the significant impact of political influence and community support in individual immigration cases, though her attorney notes many others without such access continue to face deportation.</p>
