          <p>The Tokyo government is transforming a two-kilometer expressway in Ginza into an elevated green walkway, named the Tokyo Sky Corridor, expected to be completed by the 2040s. This project, modeled after New York City's High Line, aims to create a tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, and cafes. While the KK Line was toll-free thanks to rental income from tenants in buildings underneath the expressway, the redevelopment project faces challenges, including summer heat countermeasures and structural integrity concerns. The estimated cost is 14 billion yen ($97 million), potentially increasing due to rising raw material prices.</p>

          <p>At a town hall in Pennsylvania, Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona called on the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party, citing the need to include diverse voices and perspectives. Gallego used Joe Rogan as an example of someone the party "kicked out" because his message didn't completely align with the party's. He highlighted his own success in Arizona, a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, as evidence that Democrats can win by building alliances with those they may not fully agree with. Gallego also emphasized the importance of empathizing with voters and addressing their economic concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As China aims to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its southwestern province of Yunnan is playing a crucial role in agricultural cooperation with ASEAN countries. Yunnan's involvement dates back to an alternative crop cultivation program aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Given China's large demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could effectively support the country's food security. Rising living standards in China have shifted food consumption patterns, increasing demand for meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, encourages people to explore the healing power of platonic touch through "cuddle puddles" and one-to-one therapy. She believes that human touch boosts serotonin and oxytocin levels, reduces cortisol, and regulates the nervous system. Wood screens clients and enforces boundaries to ensure a safe environment, stressing that her service is fully clothed, platonic, and nurturing. While the UK lacks a regulatory body, professionals can gain accreditation from Cuddle Professionals International, emphasizing ethical touch protocols and informed consent.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum in China by focusing on lower-tier cities, despite challenges from sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but a 4% increase in transactions, indicating efforts to maintain market share amid ongoing price wars. The company has expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets in China, adding 665 stores in the past year. Much of the growth in coffee shops across China is concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities," with Chengdu and Hangzhou experiencing significant increases in coffee shop openings.</p>

          <p>Despite the introduction of app-based digital salary payments in Japan two years ago and the nation's gradual shift towards a cashless society, the system has struggled to gain widespread adoption. Although over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment method, only a small fraction of workers currently use such apps. Surveys indicate that many Japanese individuals do not see the need for app-based salary payments, while companies cite a lack of demand and increased administrative burdens. However, the percentage of cashless payments in Japan has exceeded 40 percent, indicating a slow but steady move away from cash.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tariff pressures and global fragmentation, Chinese consumers are increasingly turning to domestic brands as a statement of resilience and national pride. Consumption in China is evolving beyond practical needs to reflect identity, confidence, and aspiration, with purchases becoming a form of self-expression. This trend is particularly evident among younger generations who view domestic brands as markers of cultural identity and creative ambition. Market data shows a surge in preference for local brands, especially in technology, fashion, and consumer goods, driven by a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation and participate in shaping a modern national identity.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is expected to experience an unusual atmospheric river event, bringing widespread rainfall and potential flooding to Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated spots potentially seeing up to 12 inches. While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., a "cutoff low" is diverting this one eastward, which might help alleviate drought conditions in some areas. Authorities advise caution and urge residents to avoid driving through flooded areas.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that a successful Eurovision entry should include a self-empowering song, simple yet effective staging, and a minor key for emotional depth. While over-the-top staging might be tempting, simplicity can make a song more memorable. It's important to avoid being too repetitive, and add a surprise twist. Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that "embrace the LGBT community", as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).</p>
