Kevin De Bruyne played his final game against the Cottagers, bringing to an end a trophy-laden decade at the club. There does not appear to be any way back for Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips and Maximo Perrone, who have all been out on loan this season. It will be an important period of transition off the pitch too. Guardiola's long-time associate Begiristain, who he has enjoyed so much success with at both City and Barcelona, will leave this summer and Viana has already started as the new director of football.</p>
