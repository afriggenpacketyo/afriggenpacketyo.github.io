        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress reportedly concluded their case was weak, according to sources familiar with their findings. A central witness, Daniel Richman, told investigators that the former FBI director never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously. An internal memo recommended against charging Comey, citing "likely insurmountable problems" in proving the case to a jury. Despite these internal warnings, a politically appointed prosecutor proceeded with the indictment, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the Nobel Peace Prize, detailing its history, the selection process, and notable past winners ahead of the upcoming announcement. It explains that the award honors individuals or organizations for advancing peace and international fraternity. The piece also addresses Donald Trump's stated desire for the award and his multiple nominations, noting that while he has touted his foreign policy achievements, experts consider his winning unlikely. The committee's decisions are kept secret for 50 years, and a nomination does not imply an endorsement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new technical analysis argues that Ernest Shackleton's polar exploration vessel, Endurance, was not as strong as its legend suggests. The research posits that the ship, originally built for Arctic tourism, had structural weaknesses that made it vulnerable to the compressive force of pack ice. This contradicts the long-held belief that it was an exceptionally well-built ship for its time. The author of the paper, who was part of the 2022 expedition that found the wreck, suggests the ship's design flaws, not just the loss of its rudder, led to its demise in 1915.</p>

          <h2>The Cultural and Linguistic History of the Pumpkin, an American Icon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the history of the pumpkin, tracing its linguistic roots from Greek and French to its botanical origins in the Americas. Initially a vital food source for Indigenous peoples and settlers, the word "pumpkin" later became a derogatory term before evolving into a modern symbol of agrarian nostalgia. This cultural attachment, from jack-o'-lanterns to pumpkin spice lattes, now helps support small family farms through seasonal tourism and events. The gourd's journey reflects shifting American cultural values and a romanticized connection to a rural past.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and support staff have been successfully brought to safety after being stranded by a severe weekend blizzard on the Chinese side of Mount Everest. The storm struck a high-altitude area above 16,000 feet, cutting off access and trapping the groups in tents. Rescue teams were dispatched with food, medicine, and oxygen supplies to assist in the evacuation. All individuals were accounted for and moved to a nearby town, with some having been treated for hypothermia during the ordeal.</p>

          <p>After causing concern among fans, Freida Parton clarified that her recent social media call for prayers for her sister, country music legend Dolly Parton, was not meant to imply a serious illness. She explained that Dolly was just "a little under the weather" and that she, as a younger sister, simply believes strongly in the power of prayer. This clarification comes after Dolly recently postponed a Las Vegas residency due to unspecified "health challenges," though she assured fans she was not quitting the business.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has begun a two-day visit to India, leading what has been described as the largest-ever British trade mission. The trip aims to build on the free trade agreement signed between the two nations in July, which will reduce tariffs on goods like textiles, whiskey, and cars. Starmer encouraged the business delegation to seize the opportunities presented by the deal, which is intended to significantly boost bilateral trade. The visit underscores the UK's post-Brexit strategy of strengthening economic partnerships with major global economies.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Transport is anticipating a record-breaking 2.4 billion trips during the current eight-day 'Golden Week' national holiday, representing a 6.2% increase over the previous year.

          <p>Australia's cricket captain, Pat Cummins, is in doubt for the upcoming Ashes series against England due to a persistent back stress injury. Recent scans have reportedly shown that the issue has not healed, making his participation in the first Test and potentially the entire series uncertain. The absence of Cummins, a premier fast bowler and the team's leader, would be a major setback for Australia. In his place, Scott Boland would likely join the bowling attack, with Steve Smith expected to take over the captaincy.</p>

          <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion. This acquisition is a key part of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's strategy to advance what he calls "Physical AI," which aims to fuse advanced artificial intelligence with robotics. The deal strengthens SoftBank's portfolio in automation and AI, which already includes major holdings like chip designer Arm. For ABB, the sale provides immediate value to shareholders and shelves its previous plans to spin off the robotics unit as a separate company.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, with total payouts from lenders estimated to reach £8.2 billion.

The regulator aims to have the scheme operational by early next year to provide fair redress to customers who were overcharged for their vehicle loans.
