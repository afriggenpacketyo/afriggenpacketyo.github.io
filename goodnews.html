          <p>John F. Kennedy International Airport is developing a new $9.5 billion Terminal 1, set to be its largest and dedicated solely to international travelers, with its first phase opening in mid-2026. This terminal will feature 23 gates, over 300,000 square feet of dining and retail space, and a unique cash-and-carry duty-free shopping experience. Part of a $19 billion airport overhaul, the design emphasizes natural light and a unified layout for departures, security, and customs. The project also includes a microgrid with solar panels for energy resiliency, addressing the need for modernized U.S. airport infrastructure.</p>

          <p>India and the Philippines have conducted their inaugural joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea, coinciding with Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos's state visit to New Delhi. The two-day patrol, involving three Indian vessels and two Filipino frigates, underscores both nations' commitment to upholding international maritime law, including the UNCLOS. This increased military cooperation is expected to provoke strong reactions from China, which asserts expansive claims over the South China Sea and views such activities as challenges to its sovereignty. The joint patrol signifies growing regional efforts to address maritime security concerns and maintain a rules-based order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) could be a formidable contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, potentially surpassing Kamala Harris. The author highlights AOC's strong polling numbers, significant fundraising capabilities, and unique ability to generate enthusiasm, evidenced by large crowds at her rallies. In contrast, Harris has struggled with voter enthusiasm and declining support, leading to donor fatigue. While acknowledging doubts about AOC's viability due to her age and far-left ideology in a general election, the article suggests her primary strength lies in mobilizing the Democratic base, which could prove decisive in a primary contest.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in reshaping its aviation supply chain, aiming for greater self-sufficiency in aircraft components beyond just airliners. A key development is the positive progress of the domestically produced CJ-1000A large commercial jet engine, which developers claim will perform on par with leading international counterparts. This ongoing effort reflects Beijing's strategic goal to reduce reliance on foreign parts and close long-standing technological gaps in critical aerospace areas. A successful rollout of such advanced components would represent a major leap in China's campaign for aviation independence, solidifying its position as a major player across all levels of the global aerospace industry.</p>

          <h2>Experts Clarify the Limited Need for Electrolyte Drinks for General Hydration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the necessity of electrolyte drinks for hydration, concluding that most people do not need them. While electrolytes like salt and potassium are indeed lost in sweat, medical experts and sports scientists assert that regular water intake and a balanced diet, including fruits and vegetables, are generally sufficient for most individuals. The human body is adept at regulating its electrolyte levels, and the typical Western diet often provides more than enough sodium. Electrolyte supplements are primarily beneficial for elite athletes engaging in prolonged, heavy sweating or individuals experiencing rapid fluid loss due to severe illness. For the general public, plain water remains the most effective hydration choice.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has agreed to substantial commitments with the U.S., including spending up to $150 billion over five years on U.S. equipment for its semiconductor, aerospace, and data center sectors, and its state energy firm buying $3.4 billion in LNG annually. These concessions are part of a trade deal to ease U.S. tariffs, which will be set at 19% on Malaysian imports. Malaysia will also reduce or abolish duties on 98.4% of U.S. imports and ease non-tariff barriers. While securing some tariff exemptions, Malaysia's trade minister warned of potential additional U.S. tariffs on semiconductors due to national security reasons, highlighting ongoing trade complexities.

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season under new manager Ruben Amorim shows signs of positive change, with a more relaxed environment and intense, disguised training methods. Amorim treats players as adults, emphasizing responsibility and group performance reviews over individual criticism. Tactically, the team is adapting to a three-man defense that shifts into midfield during build-up, and new signings like Matheus Cunha and Omar Marmoush suggest a more direct, high-octane attacking style. While initial reports from the sports science team are positive, the article questions whether these "green shoots" will translate into sustained success in the upcoming Premier League season, particularly against strong rivals like Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Singaporean billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a corruption scandal involving former transportation minister Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping Iswaran cover up evidence by belatedly billing him for a private jet trip and other expenses, after Iswaran discovered police were investigating. While Ong originally faced charges for gifting, prosecutors and his lawyers agreed to a fine instead of jail time due to his poor health and lesser culpability compared to the former minister. This high-profile case underscores Singapore's strict anti-corruption stance and the legal consequences for those involved.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's tactical approach under Pep Guardiola is undergoing a significant evolution, with Pep Lijnders, formerly Jurgen Klopp's key assistant at Liverpool, joining the coaching staff. This appointment suggests Guardiola is embracing a more direct, high-octane attacking style, incorporating elements of the "Kloppite" philosophy that previously countered his own positional play. Data indicates a shift towards less possession and more fast breaks for City, reflecting Guardiola's acknowledgement of modern football's evolving rhythms. New player signings like Omar Marmoush, Rayan Cherki, and Tijjani Reijnders align with this new direction, emphasizing ball carrying and directness, indicating a strategic shift for the club.</p>
