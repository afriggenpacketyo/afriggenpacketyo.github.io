          <p>Shares for the Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals soared by nearly 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company. This partnership, which includes a $35.6 million investment, is part of a U.S. government initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper and cobalt. The investment supports the development of the Ambler mining district in Alaska, a project previously halted by the Biden administration but now being advanced. The move aims to bolster resources essential for energy infrastructure and defense technologies, though it faces opposition over potential environmental impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A couple in New Orleans discovered a 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker while clearing their yard, sparking an investigation into its origins and an effort to repatriate it to Italy. The marble headstone, dedicated to a second-century sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus, was identified by university experts as a relic missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy. The museum was heavily damaged during World War II, and it is believed the artifact was lost in the chaos and somehow transported to the U.S. The FBI's art crime team is now involved in returning the historically significant tombstone to its home country.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will begin a phased restart of production at some of its UK manufacturing sites after a severe cyberattack halted operations in early September. The resumption will start at its engine and battery facilities, with vehicle manufacturing expected to follow later in the week. To mitigate the financial impact on its supply chain, JLR has also launched a program to accelerate payments to its most critical suppliers, many of whom had laid off workers due to the production stoppage. However, industry experts warn that a full recovery for the company and its suppliers will likely take several more weeks.</p>

          <p>Sungrow Power Supply, the world's largest manufacturer of solar inverters and energy storage systems, has filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The move comes as the company navigates new U.S. import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese-made solar products. Based in Hefei, Sungrow holds a significant global market share, having maintained its leading position in solar inverter shipments for ten consecutive years. The company is seeking to leverage Hong Kong's booming stock market to raise capital as it faces a challenging international trade environment, with U.S. tariffs on its products expected to rise.</p>

          <p>UK police have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled a major international criminal network believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China over the past year. The investigation, the largest of its kind in the UK, began after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow, where nearly 900 other stolen devices were found. The gang is thought to be behind as much as half of all phone thefts in London, where the crime has nearly tripled in four years. The operation reveals the lucrative nature of the stolen phone trade, with devices sold for significantly higher prices overseas.</p>

          <p>UNESCO's executive board has nominated Khaled el-Anani, an Egyptologist and former Egyptian minister of tourism and antiquities, to be the agency's next director-general. If confirmed, el-Anani will be the first person from the Arab world to lead the UN's cultural and scientific organization. His nomination comes at a challenging time for UNESCO, which faces significant budget shortfalls following the U.S. withdrawal from the agency under the Trump administration. El-Anani has stated that addressing the budget crisis and seeking to regain U.S. membership will be his top priorities upon taking office.</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to significantly reduce energy consumption. The facility houses servers in a 1,300-tonne cabin submerged 35 meters deep, using seawater as a natural coolant to lower operational costs compared to land-based centers. This initiative is a key part of Hainan's plan to develop new technologies for the blue economy. The project's first phase is complete, with long-term plans to build a subsea data center featuring 100 such data cabins, bolstering China's technological infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A unique art exhibition is creating a dialogue between ancient Chinese maritime history and Western art by displaying artifacts from a Tang dynasty shipwreck alongside a replica sailboat and Impressionist paintings. The curator was inspired by a rare Claude Monet painting of merchant ships, which she saw as a reflection of how art, like trade, transcends borders. The exhibition aims to show that maritime culture acts as a vessel for global exchange, connecting distant lands and cultures. This concept is mirrored in the way art can travel and share its message, creating an enduring cycle of cultural inspiration and connection.</p>

While acknowledging the Saudi league's standard is not yet on par with Europe's, she sees an opportunity to help develop the sport there. She addresses the controversy surrounding her move, stating that while she understands the criticism, her decision does not mean she condones certain policies.</p>

          <h2>World Bank Increases China's 2025 Growth Forecast to 4.8%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 02:05:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. The revision comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., which saw tariffs escalate over the summer. China's economy has been supported by government stimulus and strong export growth, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe, which has helped offset a domestic real estate slump and weak consumer spending. However, the World Bank anticipates this momentum will slow, projecting growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus measures fade and export demand softens. (not investment advice)</p>
