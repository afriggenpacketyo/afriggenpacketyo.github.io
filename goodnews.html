        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel, making it the company's largest single shareholder in a move to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. This action, converting grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, is driven by strategic competition with China and the race for AI dominance, rather than an economic crisis. The goal is to reduce reliance on foreign chip fabrication, particularly from Taiwan, and mitigate national security risks associated with foreign-made microchips. This level of government involvement in a private company is rare and carries potential risks of political pressure on business decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes major powers like China, Russia, and India, highlights a push for a new global order. However, the article argues that for this vision to be effective and avoid further global fragmentation into competing blocs, it must be matched by Western engagement. The author suggests that declarations of intent are insufficient without the establishment of new, Bretton Woods-type international institutions for monetary and economic governance. The SCO, now encompassing 27 members and partners, has the collective weight to contribute significantly to such a multilateral initiative.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status underscores Japan's ongoing debate over its male-only succession law. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the imperial family faces a potential succession crisis that reflects the nation's broader demographic challenges. This event has reignited discussions about allowing female members of the family, such as Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne to ensure the monarchy's future.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the centennial of its move to Dessau, Germany, but the occasion is shadowed by criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD has denounced the movement's legacy, echoing historical attacks by the Nazis who shut down the school in 1933. Despite these political pressures, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with a year of exhibitions and events focusing on modern materials and sustainable design. The foundation's director expressed concern about the party's rise but also noted a surge in public support for the institution in response to the attacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially be worth over $1 trillion if highly ambitious growth targets are met. The plan, which would grant Musk up to 12% of the company's stock over a decade, is designed to keep him at the helm and incentivize the company's expansion into AI and robotics. To receive the full package, Musk must increase Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The proposal has raised concerns among some analysts about corporate governance and executive compensation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article revisits the legendary 'scorpion kick' save by Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita during a friendly match against England at Wembley 30 years ago. The audacious move, where Higuita cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels, cemented his legacy as one of football's most flamboyant and unconventional players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the 'sweeper-keeper' role, famous for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring abilities, and a career that was as controversial as it was brilliant. The scorpion kick remains an iconic moment that perfectly captured his unique spirit.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision was "arbitrary and capricious," as it would force people to return to dangerously unstable home countries. The ruling reinstates legal protections for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating it would explore all legal options to end the program.</p>

          <p>A fierce competition for a small pool of elite artificial intelligence researchers, dubbed the 'AI talent war,' has erupted among tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft. These companies are offering multi-million dollar compensation packages to attract top specialists capable of building and training the large language models that power modern AI. The high salaries are driven by the immense cost and strategic importance of developing proprietary AI, creating a supply-and-demand crisis for talent. This trend risks leaving startups and traditional industries behind, as they cannot compete with the massive financial incentives offered by Big Tech.</p>
