          <p>The 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage is set to begin, with a notable opening pairing reuniting Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood for Team Europe. This article explores the critical factors that will likely decide the tournament, including the importance of a strong start in the first-day foursomes, a session that has historically set the tone for the eventual winner. It also discusses the potential impact of the famously boisterous New York crowd and how each team's experience, or lack thereof, could play a pivotal role. The strategic decisions by captains Luke Donald and Keegan Bradley are highlighted as essential elements in the quest to win the coveted trophy.</p>

          <p>Newly obtained architectural renderings provide a more detailed view of the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently being built in the White House's East Wing. The project, announced by the Trump administration, will have a seated capacity of 650 and is significantly larger than the main White House building. According to press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the construction is being funded by private donors and President Trump himself, with a commitment to disclose donor names. Corporate and individual donors, including Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir, have reportedly pledged nearly $200 million to cover the costs of the project, which is being designed by McCrery Architects PLLC.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 16:03:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%, making it an increasingly attractive borrowing option for homeowners. With cumulative home equity in the U.S. reaching a record $17.8 trillion, many owners have substantial funds to tap into. This article suggests that opening a HELOC this fall is advantageous due to its cost-effectiveness compared to personal loans or credit cards. Furthermore, with expectations of additional Fed rate cuts, the variable rate of a HELOC could lead to even lower costs for borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Li emphasized that the steady development of bilateral ties requires cooperation from both governments. His appeal comes amid a period of heightened trade friction since the start of President Trump's second term, which has seen the imposition of significant tariffs, restrictions on Chinese investment, and other trade penalties. Li framed organizations like the US-China Business Council as crucial bonds between the two nations that need to be strengthened.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 60th home run of the season, joining an elite group of MLB players that includes Babe Ruth and Aaron Judge. The milestone occurred during a game against the Colorado Rockies, where Raleigh hit two home runs to reach the 60-homer mark. In a heartwarming moment that followed, the fan who caught the historic ball was seen giving it to a young boy sitting nearby, an act of kindness widely praised on social media. Raleigh's achievement also coincided with the Mariners clinching their first AL West title since 2001, making for a doubly historic night for the team and its fans.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve allegations that it misled millions of customers into signing up for its Prime membership and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The settlement includes $1.5 billion for customer refunds and a $1 billion civil penalty, one of the largest ever secured by the agency. The FTC accused Amazon of using manipulative design practices, or "subscription traps," that violated consumer protection laws. As part of the deal, Amazon, which did not admit wrongdoing, must also simplify its cancellation process and make its enrollment offers more transparent to consumers.</p>

          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowing through a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable, with this article breaking down the potential monthly costs for a $40,000 loan. Currently, a 10-year HELOC at an average rate of 7.88% would cost approximately $483 per month, while a 15-year term would be about $379 per month. These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly less than last fall. The article also notes that borrowers can initially make interest-only payments, further reducing short-term costs, and may see payments decrease further if the Fed continues to cut rates.

While the SSA has been notifying recipients of the change, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other way to receive payments.

          <p>This article from The Atlantic delves into its archives to reflect on the legacy of Allen Ginsberg, describing him as a quintessential "American poet-buffoon" known for his swashbuckling vulnerability and counter-cultural influence. It highlights his 1966 essay advocating for marijuana and his impact on literary movements like the "Hangries" in Calcutta. The piece contrasts Allen's revolutionary work, like the poem "Howl," with the more formal poetry of his father, Louis Ginsberg, who was also published in the magazine. Despite their stylistic differences, the article notes the mutual respect and generosity the two poets shared, culminating in Allen's poignant introduction to his father's book.</p>

The inclusion is expected to be particularly significant for lower-income countries, where stigma and a lack of awareness have often led to denial of the problem.

This genetic advantage was complemented by a lifestyle that included no smoking or alcohol and a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and yogurt.

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto is currently in the Atlantic, and while not expected to make landfall, it could interact with another developing storm system, which will be named Imelda. This interaction could lead to the Fujiwhara effect, a rare meteorological phenomenon where two storms orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. According to meteorologists, the outcome depends on the relative strength of the two systems; often, the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one. While an interaction is considered unlikely in this case, the possibility adds a layer of unpredictability to the storm forecasts for the region.</p>
