        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a warning to travelers after a notable increase in cases of the chikungunya virus, with over 70 infections reported in the first half of the year. This figure is more than double the number from the same period last year, with nearly all cases linked to travel in regions like India and Sri Lanka. While the virus is rarely fatal, it can cause debilitating long-term joint pain, and there is no risk of local transmission as the mosquito vector is not present in the UK. Officials are urging travelers to take preventative measures against mosquito bites.</p>

          <p>Following their $8-billion takeover of Paramount, David Ellison and his leadership team from Skydance Media have detailed their plan to revitalize the media giant. The new strategy involves a significant increase in film production, aiming for 15 to 20 movies annually, with a strong focus on major franchises like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Transformers." Ellison emphasized a commitment to making Paramount a top destination for talent and creating content for broad audiences, moving away from political divisions. The leadership also plans to make substantial investments in theatrical releases rather than prioritizing low-cost films for the Paramount+ streaming service.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, experienced record flooding after an "outburst flood" from the Mendenhall Glacier, but the immediate threat has now passed as water levels recede. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record, after a glacier-dammed basin released a massive volume of water. Thanks to newly installed temporary barriers, officials reported that a potentially catastrophic event was avoided with minimal damage to the nearly 1,000 structures that were at risk. These annual floods are a consequence of a retreating glacier, a phenomenon linked to the warming climate.</p>

          <p>A new survey by TravelPerk indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure trips, is a growing trend, with 55% of business travelers reporting they have had loved ones join them. This practice is even more common among C-suite executives, at 73%. Motivations include reclaiming personal time, reducing loneliness, and saving money on what becomes a partially subsidized vacation. While many companies quietly accept the practice as long as work objectives are met and personal expenses are kept separate, some employees remain hesitant to broadcast their plans for fear of appearing unprofessional.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver for liquidation. The proceeds will go toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims, whom Alex Jones had falsely claimed were actors. This move could lead to the imminent seizure of company property and the Infowars brand name itself, potentially ending Jones's long-running show. The families' lawyers expressed that this step will finally bring accountability for Jones's cruel harassment.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study in Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD can offer significant long-term benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the BMJ, found that individuals on ADHD medication had reduced risks of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. The findings are based on data from nearly 150,000 people and provide strong evidence that medication helps by reducing impulsivity and inattention, which are linked to these adverse outcomes. Researchers believe this information can help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about starting treatment.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. measures curbing China's shipbuilding dominance, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. This strategic shift is seen as a way for Korean shipbuilders to overcome domestic constraints such as labor shortages and high costs, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. For example, HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. This move allows them to leverage lower labor costs in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the bank-owned parent company of the payment app Zelle. The suit alleges that EWS knowingly failed to implement adequate security and anti-fraud measures, which allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims that design flaws, such as a quick registration process and lack of verification, made the network a prime target for fraudulent activity. Zelle has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt," while the AG seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur suffered a heartbreaking loss to Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup, losing on penalties after conceding two late goals to squander a 2-0 lead. Despite the disappointing result, the performance showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For 85 minutes, the team displayed a pragmatic, organized, and efficient style, with both goals coming from well-executed set-pieces, a hallmark of Frank's previous work. While the late collapse highlights areas for improvement, the tactical approach suggests a clear departure from the previous era and a new foundation to build upon for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>This article explores the shift in public trust from traditional media institutions to individual online creators, marking a revolution in how information is consumed. While social media is rife with misinformation, a growing cohort of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and experts—are using these platforms to provide factual, nuanced content to audiences seeking reliable information. The author argues that these creators are building trust through direct engagement but face challenges competing in an attention economy that rewards virality over veracity. To thrive, this new media ecosystem needs better infrastructure, such as certification systems and collaborative support models.</p>
