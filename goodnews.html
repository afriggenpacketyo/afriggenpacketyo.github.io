        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% during its upcoming meeting, signaling a continuation of its cautious approach. The decision reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and their potential economic impact, as well as a slight uptick in inflation. While some members have expressed concerns about slowing growth, the labor market remains relatively strong. Experts suggest that the Fed's decision will likely keep credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages at elevated levels, benefiting savers while posing challenges for borrowers.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are making strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace chemotherapy in some cases. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck have invested billions in developing ADCs, with some showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. While challenges remain in refining these treatments, experts believe ADCs represent a significant step towards precision-based cancer care with improved efficacy and safety profiles.</p>

          <p>An F1 Q&A article discusses whether McLaren should have allowed Lando Norris to pass teammate Oscar Piastri during the Canadian Grand Prix. While Piastri has had a better season overall, the article argues that there is little difference in outright performance between the two drivers. Norris's mistakes have cost him points, but McLaren does not typically prioritize one driver over the other except in specific circumstances. The team is currently leading the championship, making it difficult to justify prioritizing Piastri at this time.</p>

NASA is considering skills like autonomy and the ability to cope with isolation as increasingly important for future missions. While terrestrial explorers are rarely hired, their experiences with survival, navigation, and problem-solving in challenging conditions could prove invaluable for deep-space travel.</p>

The lack of local manufacturing capabilities and the cost of establishing such facilities in the U.S. make it impractical to produce the phone domestically.
