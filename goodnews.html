          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled the government's Spending Review, outlining budgets for departments over the next three years. The review allocates funds to public services like the NHS, schools, housing, prisons, policing, transport, and infrastructure. Education will see a ¬£2 billion real-terms budget increase by 2029, primarily aimed at addressing crumbling infrastructure and expanding free school meals and breakfast clubs. The NHS will receive a 3% annual real-terms increase in spending, covering staff pay, medicines, and patient care; however, capital spending will remain flat. A ¬£39 billion investment in social and affordable housing has been announced, potentially enabling the construction of 1.5 million homes. The police force will receive a 2.3% real-terms yearly funding increase. The ambitious infrastructure plans will materialize in the 2030s at the earliest.</p>
