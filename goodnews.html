          <p>President Donald Trump is traveling to Asia for a series of high-stakes meetings, with a primary goal of securing a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. The trip also includes participation in the ASEAN and APEC summits, with bilateral meetings scheduled with Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar bin Ibrahim. The visit to South Korea occurs amidst tensions following the deportation of hundreds of South Korean workers from a Hyundai plant in the U.S., adding a complex dynamic to the diplomatic tour.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while the Trump administration has successfully pressured NATO allies to meet their 5% defense spending commitments, it must now apply the same pressure to resolve commercial disputes. The author contends that several allied and friendly nations have failed to honor agreements with U.S. companies, citing alleged unpaid debts and expropriated property in countries like Mexico, Kuwait, and Honduras. The piece calls on the State Department and U.S. ambassadors to diplomatically enforce these commercial obligations. This would ensure that partnership with the United States requires honoring commitments to American businesses and workers.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers prepare to face the Toronto Blue Jays, sports analysts are weighing in on the key factors that will decide the 2025 World Series. Experts debate whether Shohei Ohtani is already the greatest player of all time and highlight the Dodgers' dominant starting pitching as their main strength. For the Blue Jays to succeed, they will need their star hitters, particularly the red-hot Vladimir Guerrero Jr., to pressure the Dodgers' starters early and often. While the Dodgers are favored to become baseball's first repeat champions in 25 years, Toronto's offense gives them a credible chance at an upset.</p>

          <h2>Cancer Survivors Offer Advice on How to Meaningfully Support a Loved One During Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides practical advice from cancer survivors on how friends and family can offer effective support to a loved one undergoing treatment. Instead of broad offers of help, the suggestions focus on fulfilling specific roles, such as being a 'doctor's appointment buddy' to take notes or a 'procedure pal' for emotional support during chemotherapy. Other key roles include helping with household chores and meal planning to reduce the patient's mental load. The central message is that the most valuable support comes from leveraging one's personal strengths to meet the patient's critical needs during a difficult time.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the prestigious Booker Prize have launched a new annual award dedicated to celebrating the best in children's fiction for ages eight to twelve. The Children's Booker Prize, set to launch in 2026, will uniquely feature a judging panel composed of both adults and children. UK Children's Laureate Frank Cottrell-Boyce will serve as the inaugural chair of judges. The initiative aims to champion future classics and inspire more young people to read, at a time when reading for pleasure is reportedly at a 20-year low.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the UK rose by 0.5% in September, marking the fourth straight month of growth and defying forecasts of a slight decrease. According to the Office for National Statistics, the unexpected increase was driven by strong online sales of gold and new technology, including the Nintendo Switch 2 and iPhone 17. This positive data provides a welcome sign for the British economy amid persistent concerns of a slowdown. Analysts suggest that interest rate cuts and above-inflation pay increases have given consumers more confidence to spend, despite ongoing pressures on household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Munich, Germany, will vote in a referendum to decide whether the city should pursue a bid to host the Summer Olympics in 2036, 2040, or 2044. Proponents of the bid highlight a sustainable plan that would utilize mostly existing venues, arguing it would boost the economy and Germany's global image. Opponents raise concerns about the high estimated costs, which could reach €21 billion, as well as potential increases in housing prices and negative environmental impacts. The outcome of the vote is seen as a crucial indicator of public support for hosting the Olympics in Germany.</p>

While their attack has been less prolific than in previous years, the article posits that their defensive prowess might be enough to secure the championship.
