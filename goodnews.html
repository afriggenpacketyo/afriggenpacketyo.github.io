          <p>English forward Marcus Rashford, currently on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, demonstrated a significant return to form by scoring two goals in a Champions League match against Newcastle. After a challenging period at his home club and an injury-shortened loan at Aston Villa, Rashford's performance has renewed optimism about his career. His two goals, a header and a powerful long-range strike, secured a 2-0 victory for Barcelona and were praised by both his coach and football analysts. The display suggests that the 27-year-old may be finding redemption and rediscovering his top-tier talent under Barcelona's management.</p>

          <p>FedEx shares rose over 5% in after-hours trading after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The logistics giant posted adjusted earnings of $3.83 per share on $22.24 billion in revenue, citing the resilience of its network despite a volatile global trade environment. The company noted a 6% increase in average daily volumes in the U.S., which helped offset lower revenue in its Freight segment. FedEx reaffirmed its revenue growth forecast for 2026 and is proceeding with its plan to spin off FedEx Freight into a separate publicly traded company. (not investment advice)</p>
