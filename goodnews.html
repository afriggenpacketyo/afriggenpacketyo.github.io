        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL), the world's largest EV battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong debut, highlighting the ongoing boom in the electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing of the year, with funds aimed at building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing trade tensions and a recent revenue drop due to intense competition in China, CATL's net profit increased, signaling continued growth in the EV sector. The company has faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers concerned about potential national security risks.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to investigate the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of such projects. This initiative seeks to mitigate climate change by leveraging the high CO2 absorption capacity of marine vegetation, especially in light of declining absorption capacity of forests due to aging trees. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>President Trump awarded the first-ever Medal of Sacrifice to three Florida deputies who died in the line of duty after being struck by an SUV while working to restore one of their motorcycles. The Medal of Sacrifice was posthumously awarded to Cpl. Luis Paez Jr., Deputy Sheriff Ignacio "Dan" Diaz, and Deputy Sheriff Ralph "Butch" Waller Jr., and family members and law enforcement representatives accepted the awards on their behalf. Eric Trump stated that the idea for the medal came to him while at a service for the officers and questioned why there was no medal commemorating law enforcement officers and first responders who have fallen in the line of duty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, signaling a move to stimulate the country's economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%, influenced by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. This decision follows state-backed commercial lenders' moves to reduce deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates and is part of a broader package of stimulus measures announced by Beijing earlier this month. Analysts expect further policy easing throughout the year.</p>

          <p>A new EU deal highlights the UK's continued complex relationship with its European neighbors, aiming to smooth trade frictions while staying within self-imposed Brexit limits. While the government touts improved trading ties, critics argue that the deal concedes power to the EU through "dynamic alignment," accepting future EU rule changes. The agreement's details, costs, and implications for defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualifications are still under negotiation. Despite being called a "reset," the ongoing conversation suggests a semi-permanent state of negotiation and potential shifts in the relationship's trajectory.</p>

          <p>Netflix has secured a deal to bring Sesame Street to its streaming platform, providing its 300 million subscribers access to the 56th season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes.

PBS will retain access to the episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix. The move reflects Netflix's increasing focus on children's content, with plans to add new episodes of Peppa Pig and a mobile game to the platform.</p>

          <p>The Senate has advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, after overcoming initial Democratic opposition related to concerns over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family. The legislation aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency linked to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar. Despite initial setbacks, the bill moved forward with bipartisan support after negotiators addressed some Democratic concerns.

He dedicated the run to his late mother, who died from cancer, and raised money for cancer charities in the UK, US, and Australia.

Trump, who described the conversation as having gone "very well", also said conditions for peace would need to be negotiated between the two parties.
