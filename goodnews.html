          <p>Kim Moon Soo, a former Labor Minister, has won the People Power Party's nomination for South Korea's snap presidential election set for June 3. Kim, who previously served as governor of Gyeonggi province and as a National Assembly member, is expected to form an alliance with former Prime Minister Hand Duck-soo to consolidate the conservative vote against liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung. Kim's acceptance speech emphasized a staunchly conservative vision and a firm stance against North Korea. The election aims to find a successor to President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached in December. Optimism score should be 65</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luke Charters, the York Outer MP, is advocating for a reevaluation of the 1985 legislation that prohibits alcohol consumption in view of the pitch at the top five tiers of men's football in England. Charters argues that the ban creates an inconsistency compared to other sports where drinking is permitted, and he suggests trialing relaxed restrictions, similar to ongoing trials in the women's game. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's call, and Charters proposes starting with lower leagues and family zones where alcohol consumption would remain inappropriate. The debate coincides with discussions on the Football Governance Bill and ticket pricing.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands, revealing they gained weight and adapted to their new environment, recognizing predators and catching prey. This success is significant because it demonstrates that axolotls can survive in man-made habitats, which could mitigate the effects of habitat degradation and climate change. Axolotls are culturally important to Mexicans and are also studied for their regenerative abilities.</p>
