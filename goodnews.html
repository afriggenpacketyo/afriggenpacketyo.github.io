          <p>Leaders of the G7 nations, meeting in Canada, announced an action plan to minimize risks to their supply chains for critical minerals, essential for modern technologies. With China dominating the global supply of rare earth minerals, the G7 aims to enhance cooperation within the group and with other nations to safeguard their economic and national security. Cooperation includes monitoring shortages, coordinating responses to market disruption, and diversifying mining, processing, and recycling. The G7 also endorsed documents related to AI, quantum technologies, and transnational repression, while reaffirming support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers clarified that singer Nezza is welcome back at the stadium after a controversy arose when she sang the national anthem in Spanish despite being asked to perform it in English. Nezza felt compelled to represent her community amidst ongoing protests against President Trump's immigration policies. Initially, a Dodgers employee requested the song be sung in English, but Nezza proceeded with the Spanish version, leading to conflicting messages from the team. While Nezza initially felt banned, the Dodgers have since stated that she is welcome back, reaffirming there are "no hard feelings."</p>

Goliath and the hatchling's mother, Sweet Pea, have limited interaction, as hatchlings are typically independent from birth in the wild. The zoo has applied to Guinness World Records to recognize Goliath as the oldest first-time father in history, with other zoos also reporting successful tortoise hatchings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals applying for new passports, renewals, or changes in name or sex designation may choose their identified gender. The ruling expands on an earlier decision and addresses claims that the Trump administration's policy was discriminatory against transgender Americans. The Justice Department has appealed Kobick's ruling, but the State Department has not commented on the pending litigation.</p>
