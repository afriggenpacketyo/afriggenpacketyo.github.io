        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russell Brand appeared in a London court to face multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault. This initial hearing was a procedural step in what is expected to be a lengthy legal process. Brand is accused of offenses that allegedly occurred between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. He has denied all charges, stating that his relationships have always been consensual, and has expressed his intention to defend himself in court. The next hearing, where Brand will be expected to enter a plea, is expected in about a month, with the actual trial potentially beginning a year from now due to backlogs in the British judicial system.</p>

          <p>A black woodpecker, a vulnerable species, has been sighted on Japan's main island of Honshu for the first time in four years. The sighting was confirmed from a photograph taken in 2021 on Mt. Moriyoshi in Akita Prefecture. While relatively common on Hokkaido, the black woodpecker is at increasing risk of extinction on Honshu, and the Environment Ministry emphasizes the importance of gathering up-to-date information on sightings. Experts believe there may be a female bird in the area as black woodpeckers raise their chicks together, which could help the species recover in the area.</p>

          <p>Roche has made a significant move into the competitive obesity drug market by partnering with Zealand Pharma in a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a next-generation weight loss candidate. This amylin analog, which mimics a hormone that increases satiety, could potentially offer superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs. The deal includes upfront payments to Zealand and milestone payments based on clinical trial success and sales. Both companies emphasized the strong scientific and cultural fit as key reasons for the collaboration, with the aim of providing customizable weight loss therapies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a notable victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating the Labour Party. This win, coupled with gains in mayoral and local council elections, suggests a rising influence for Reform in British politics. The victory in Runcorn was particularly significant as it flipped a traditionally safe Labour seat, fueled by voter frustration with the economy and tensions over immigration. While Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, the West of England and Doncaster, Reform performed strongly, securing second place in all three races.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, poses a silent danger even for top athletes, as highlighted by cases involving basketball star Victor Wembanyama and tennis icon Serena Williams. Sports physician Pascal Bauer emphasizes that athletes are not immune to the condition, which can range from mild shortness of breath to death if a clot detaches and causes a pulmonary embolism. Certain sports involving repetitive arm movements or contact increase the risk, as does frequent long-distance travel. Preventive measures include sports examinations, good training hygiene, adequate hydration, and movement during travel.</p>

          <p>With Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal dominating cashless payments in the EU, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expressing concerns about the risks of such dependence on US payment giants. ECB President Christine Lagarde is advocating for a European alternative to ensure digital payments remain under European control. While some experts downplay the severity of the issue, citing the prevalence of national systems like Germany's Girocard, others highlight the increasing use of app-based payments led by American tech firms. Potential solutions include a digital euro and the European Payments Initiative (EPI)'s Wero system, but challenges remain in gaining widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>Reform UK won its first Parliamentary by-election, taking Runcorn and Helsby from Labour by a narrow margin.

          <p>Faced with a trade war with the United States and struggling domestic consumption, China is reportedly easing restrictions on K-pop acts, signaling a potential U-turn in its cultural policies. The move is seen as part of a broader strategy to revitalize domestic demand by promoting cultural events and stimulating spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce. K-pop's core revenue streams, including streaming, concerts, and fan content, are considered tariff-proof, making it an attractive sector for China to support. The shift also has a diplomatic dimension, as China may seek to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea.</p>

          <p>The overnight results from Thursday's elections have confirmed that Reform is posing a major challenge to the traditional dominance of British politics enjoyed by the Conservatives and Labour. The party won 39% of the vote in the results declared so far, enough to put it well ahead of all if its rivals. Reform also seems to have a good chance of winning overall control of both Lincolnshire and Staffordshire, both of which voted heavily for Brexit in 2016. It is the first time an anti-EU party has won a by-election afresh.</p>

          <p>Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has revised its business model in the US in response to retaliatory tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The platform shifted its US operations to a "local fulfilment model," meaning all sales to American customers are now handled by locally-based sellers. Temu has been actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform. The shift comes amid speculation that Temu may phase out China-based merchants, requiring them to establish operations in the US or stop selling to American shoppers.</p>

          <p>NASA will not fund a study on China's moon sample due to the Wolf Amendment, which restricts cooperation with Chinese government entities like CNSA. Planetary scientist Timothy Glotch of Stony Brook University was selected by CNSA to receive the specimens collected by China‚Äôs lunar sample return mission in 2020. Glotch will collaborate with scientists from the University of Hong Kong and San Francisco State University to analyze the samples, with funding provided by his institution.</p>
