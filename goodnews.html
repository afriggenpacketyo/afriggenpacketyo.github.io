          <p>Uruguay's Senate has passed a law legalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to formally do so for terminally ill patients. The legislation permits an adult citizen who is mentally sound and suffering from an irreversible disease to opt for a medically-assisted death. This move aligns with Uruguay's history of socially liberal policies in the region, including the legalization of cannabis and same-sex marriage. The law has strong public support, with over 60% of Uruguayans in favor, though it has been met with sadness by the Catholic Church.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, surging 39.1% from the previous year and significantly beating market estimates.

Buoyed by the results, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling strong confidence in the continued expansion of the AI sector.

          <p>A 76-year-old hillwalker from Edinburgh, Ian Currie, has described his eight-day ordeal lost in the remote Scottish Highlands as a "long black nightmare." After getting into difficulty during bad weather on a strenuous trek, his tent and phone became soaked, leaving him unable to call for help. Exhausted and suffering from the cold, he survived by drinking from a spring before eventually being found by a local landowner and deer stalkers. The experienced walker expressed immense gratitude for his rescue and survival.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the U.S. dollar to its highest point in a year.

A Fed governor's recent comments about risks to the U.S. economic outlook have fueled this speculation. The PBOC's move reflects the ongoing strategic financial maneuvering between the two economic superpowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a visible sign of his urgency to break a postseason slump, Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani took batting practice on the field during a workout day, a rare move for the two-way player. Ohtani has struggled at the plate, going just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts since the start of the playoffs. While manager Dave Roberts has noted some recent improvements in his at-bats, Ohtani is clearly focused on finding his form. He also pushed back on the idea that his pitching duties were directly correlated to his hitting struggles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling responds to a lawsuit filed by two major unions after more than 4,000 workers received termination notices. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts, which suggested the layoffs were a political tactic to punish "Democrat Agencies," as evidence that the administration's actions were likely unlawful and capricious.</p>
