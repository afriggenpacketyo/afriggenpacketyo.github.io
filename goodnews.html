          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is not at war with Iran, but rather with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran reserves all options to defend itself. Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace, but only in the context of Iran not possessing nuclear weapons, the extent of the damage to the nuclear facilities remains unknown. Vance declined to provide specific intelligence details but expressed confidence that the strikes have significantly delayed Iran's nuclear weapons development. The remarks aim to clarify the U.S. objectives and to de-escalate tensions while maintaining a firm stance against nuclear proliferation.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio discusses the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, emphasizing it was not an attack on Iran or its people, but a targeted effort to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, as the U.S. is ready to negotiate if Iran chooses diplomacy. Rubio insists Iran has everything needed to build a nuclear weapon, regardless of whether an order to weaponize has been given, while also stating that the U.S. will defend its interests and allies in the Middle East. He also stated that Iran's closure of the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move, while emphasizing that the U.S. is open to a diplomatic solution that allows Iran a civilian nuclear program, but not enrichment on its own soil.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people in the U.S. Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously high temperatures as a rare June heatwave persists, with heat advisories issued across a wide region. The National Weather Service forecasts heat indices exceeding 100F in many areas, prompting cities like Philadelphia to declare heat emergencies and open cooling centers. The extreme heat is attributed to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, with meteorologists noting the unusual extent of the affected area. The heatwave is expected to continue into the coming week, with temperatures potentially reaching 100F in major cities like New York and Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99, which occurred on the third day of the first Test at Headingley, as India was building their lead. Brook was dropped twice and played aggressively before being caught, as Jasprit Bumrah ended with 5-83. Stokes removed Sai Sudharsan, with India closing at 90-2, holding a 96-run advantage, as the umpires decided that play could not continue. The match is finely balanced, setting the stage for a tense conclusion.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday, despite the U.S. military entering the war between Israel and Iran by striking three key Iranian nuclear sites, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement would expedite a resolution, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline. Analyst Fadi Arbid suggests the Gulf region has distanced itself from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution, which has helped it isolate itself from any significant short-term market impact. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing 2.7% higher on Sunday (not investment advice).</p>

The UK government has offered a response that suggests support for the outcome‚Äîdelaying Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons‚Äîwhile not explicitly endorsing the means. Discussions about the legality of UK involvement had occurred at the top of government, with the attorney general providing advice on a range of scenarios. The situation could prompt further difficult decisions for the prime minister, as the US could end up requesting military support from the UK in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials have revealed details of "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, with decoys sent elsewhere, as the bombers dropped 14 "bunker-buster" bombs on sites at Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Isfahan. The chairman warned Iran against retaliation, as the Defense Secretary called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success", with the strikes aimed at devastating the Iranian nuclear program, but not targeting Iranian troops or the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>After years of studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda, a leading voice in conscious parenting, shares five phrases that instantly make kids not want to listen. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. Instead, Raouda suggests using language that makes children actually want to cooperate, creating the conditions where cooperation feels natural. She emphasizes that children thrive when they feel respected, emotionally safe and involved in the process, which reduces power struggles and raises children who trust us, regulate themselves more easily, and grow into emotionally resilient adults.</p>

The Rockets finished second in the Western Conference but were eliminated by the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs, as Durant has one year left on his current contract and is due to earn $54.7m next season.

The pilot program, launching on June 22, will involve a small number of cars operating in a "geofenced area" and will be limited to investors and enthusiasts who have been invited to participate in the pilot. Safety concerns have been raised by government officials and advocacy groups, as Tesla is under scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with Tesla's stock regaining some lost ground since Musk said he would return his focus to Tesla. The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation (not investment advice).</p>

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez opposed the deal, citing that the 5% figure would be unreasonable and counterproductive, while also facing political pressure at home.

McKenzie also states that Iranian decision-making may be crippled due to the loss of senior leaders and that the U.S. has good plans to clear the Strait of Hormuz if Iran attempts to close it.

The question of how Iran will respond has raised fears that the regime could seek to block ships from traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, which is used to transport about 20% of oil used around the world.
