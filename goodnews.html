          <p>PBS CEO Paula Kerger said that they have "never seen a circumstance like this" after President Trump issued an executive order aimed at cutting federal funding to PBS and NPR. Kerger said the administration is "coming after us on many different ways," including with a possible rescission of already appropriated funds, and an effort to challenge sponsorships from corporations through the Federal Communications Commission, among other things. She said PBS gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, but that figure is an aggregate number, with some stations in small communities receiving up to 40% or 50% of their funding from the government.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he refused to overturn the 2020 election results.

The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>
