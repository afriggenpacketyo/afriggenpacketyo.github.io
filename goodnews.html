          <p>A man suspected of leading the deadly 1982 gun and grenade attack on the Jo Goldenberg Jewish restaurant in Paris has been arrested by Palestinian authorities in the occupied West Bank. The assault killed six people and injured at least 20, but no one has ever been punished for the crime. The suspect, Mahmoud Khader Abed Adra, is believed to have been a member of the Abu Nidal Palestinian faction. French President Emmanuel Macron credited the arrest to "excellent co-operation" with the Palestinian Authority, noting that France's recent decision to recognize a Palestinian state enabled the extradition request to proceed.</p>

The company, which describes itself as an "ecommerce accelerator" for over 200 brands, raised $300 million in its initial public offering, valuing the Utah-based firm at approximately $2.5 billion. The IPO comes as the market for tech offerings shows renewed signs of life, though Pattern faces risks from its heavy reliance on Amazon's platform and uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policy and tariffs.

After his original club was effectively shut down in Russia, Savin re-established the team in Ypsonas, a suburb of Limassol, and has since led it to promotion into Cyprus's top division. The club has become a unifying force for the Russian-speaking immigrant community on the island, bringing together people from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Despite personal sacrifices, Savin remains focused on his next goal: qualifying for European club competitions.</p>

          <p>After an eight-month vacancy and significant delays, the Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The confirmation, which passed with a 47-43 vote, comes just before the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York. Waltz's confirmation fills a critical diplomatic role as the U.S. navigates several international crises, including tensions with Russia, China, and Iran. During his confirmation hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for major reforms at the U.N. while stressing the importance of U.S. engagement to counter China's growing influence within the global body.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning percussionist Evelyn Glennie and celebrated poet Raymond Antrobus, both prominent Deaf artists, have released a new collaborative album titled "Aloud." The project was created with remarkable spontaneity, recorded in single, unrehearsed takes where neither artist knew what the other would perform. Glennie, known for experiencing music through physical vibration, provides a primal, resonant soundscape for Antrobus's poignant poetry, which often explores his identity and upbringing. Their collaboration challenges conventional understandings of music and hearing, creating a unique dialogue that is both intimate and artistically powerful, rooted in a shared sensory experience of the world.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, mortgage rates have fallen, providing significant savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to around 6.13%, reducing the monthly principal and interest payment on a $750,000 loan to approximately $4,560. This is a savings of over $450 per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the beginning of 2025. Over the life of the loan, this difference can amount to over $160,000 in interest savings, highlighting the substantial financial impact of the Fed's policy shift on the housing market.

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated that he supports two more interest rate cuts before the end of the year, in addition to the one approved this week. Kashkari believes that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a temporary, one-time effect, leaving room for the central bank to ease monetary policy further. He cited a weakening labor market as a key reason for his more dovish stance, arguing that the risks associated with it justify a more accommodative policy. This view places him among those on the Federal Open Market Committee advocating for a total of three rate cuts in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new and visually stunning species of butterfly, named Francis's gorgeous sapphire, in the Namba Mountains of Angola. The vibrant blue butterfly was found living in high-altitude, boulder-strewn forests, where its caterpillars feed on a specific type of mistletoe. This habitat, however, is under threat from an increasing frequency of fires, which could endanger the mistletoe plants and, consequently, the butterfly population. The discovery highlights the rich biodiversity of the region and underscores the importance of conservation efforts to protect these unique ecosystems from threats, including those exacerbated by climate change, which could lead to habitat loss.</p>

The framework is intended to replace the UK's controversial Legacy Act, which included a conditional amnesty and was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties. The new plan includes restoring inquests that were halted, establishing a cross-border commission to receive information on Troubles cases, and creating a dedicated legacy unit within the Irish police force. Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris called the deal a "big step forward," expressing hope that it will build confidence and provide a path toward reconciliation and justice.</p>

Miran argued there is no clear evidence that tariffs have driven macroeconomically significant inflation, pointing to historical data from 2018-2019.

The FTC also claims Ticketmaster used deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics. This lawsuit follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust case filed in May that accuses the companies of illegally monopolizing the live entertainment industry, further intensifying legal pressure on the ticketing giant.</p>

The policy, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child.

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent state visit to the United Kingdom, characterized by extensive pageantry and flattering rhetoric from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, produced few concrete policy breakthroughs. While the visit successfully avoided major diplomatic disasters and strengthened leader-level relationships, it failed to yield progress on key issues like the removal of U.S. steel tariffs or a stronger commitment on Ukraine. Experts suggest that while flattery may be a necessary diplomatic tool with Trump, it does not guarantee tangible outcomes. The visit serves as a case study for European leaders on how to engage with the Trump administration in an era where traditional alliances are being redefined.</p>
