          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor and former mathematics professor, has won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Dan's victory is expected to ease concerns about Romania potentially joining Hungary and Slovakia in opposing aid to Ukraine and aligning with Moscow. Simion has alleged electoral fraud, echoing claims made by Trump after the 2020 election in the United States, but provided no evidence to support these accusations.</p>

          <p>A secretive US factory in Arizona, operated by TSMC, is mass-producing advanced semiconductors, marking the first time this work is being done in the US. This move, driven by the threat of tariffs on imported chips, embodies the contradiction in Trump's America First plan. While Trump touts the factory as a victory for his economic policies, the manufacturing process relies on global technologies, highlighting the interconnectedness of the world economy and the complex geopolitical currents flowing through this critical site.</p>
