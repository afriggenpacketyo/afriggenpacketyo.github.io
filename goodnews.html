          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged the European Union to enhance communication and deepen cooperation, stating that a stable China-EU relationship can provide more certainty to the world. During a meeting with top EU officials in Beijing to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties, Xi described the two powers as "two big guys" on the world stage. He emphasized the need for mutual respect and seeking common ground to guide the relationship forward. The call for collaboration comes at a critical juncture, with both sides navigating complex geopolitical and economic landscapes, including significant trade disagreements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has declared that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's decision. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the proposed interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born on U.S. soil, is not legally sound. This ruling represents another significant legal obstacle for the administration's policy, which has faced numerous challenges since its inception. The article provides historical context, referencing the 14th Amendment and key legal precedents that established birthright citizenship as a cornerstone of U.S. law.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a major settlement with the federal government, committing to pay $200 million to resolve investigations into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The deal, praised by President Trump, will also see the university pay an additional $21 million to settle related EEOC investigations. In exchange, the administration will restore $400 million in federal research grants that were withheld from the school since March. As part of the agreement, Columbia will codify reforms aimed at combating antisemitism, including new policies on protests and the hiring of special safety officers, though it does not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>A rare species of violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla Shores beach, an unusual sighting that researchers believe could be linked to warming ocean temperatures. An oceanographer from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography found the vibrant purple creature, which typically inhab ජීin warmer subtropical seas and stays afloat using a self-secreted bubble raft. This marks the first time in a decade that Scripps researchers have spotted these snails locally, coinciding with a period of notably warm offshore water. The discovery has prompted calls for the public to report further sightings as a potential indicator of climate change impacts.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay a $200 million settlement to the U.S. government to resolve accusations that it failed to protect Jewish students amid campus protests. This agreement will lead to the reinstatement of $400 million in federal research grants that the Trump administration had frozen. The deal is part of a broader campaign by the administration targeting higher education institutions over issues like diversity programs and campus protests, with billions in funding withheld from other universities like Harvard. While Columbia does not admit wrongdoing, the settlement codifies several policy changes, including stricter rules for on-campus demonstrations.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, fueled by surging demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence systems. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its operating profit climb by nearly 69% year-over-year, solidifying its leadership in the advanced memory market. SK Hynix anticipates continued strong demand for AI-related hardware throughout 2025 and plans to double its HBM sales compared to the previous year. This performance comes amid intense competition with rivals Samsung and Micron. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Websites hosting pornographic content in the UK must now implement robust age-verification systems, ending the era of simple self-declaration checkboxes. Under the new Online Safety Act rules, platforms face fines of up to £18 million for non-compliance. Ofcom, the media regulator, has approved several methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching, to ensure users are over 18. However, concerns remain regarding user privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs, which platforms are now required to discourage. The changes have sparked debate among users worried about data security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly for semiconductors and chemical products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of anticipated U.S. trade policy changes. However, economists express caution, noting that domestic demand remains sluggish and that the export-led growth may not be sustainable if global trade softens under the threat of tariffs. The performance of the externally-facing economy remains heavily dependent on ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, a strategic move that analysts see as an indirect effort to reshape regional supply chains and counter China's economic influence. Under the deals, imports from the two Southeast Asian nations will face a 19% U.S. tariff, while American exports to them will be duty-free. This approach aims to provide an alternative to Chinese manufacturing and tap into the region's rare earth mineral reserves. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within these countries.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted with bipartisan support to issue a subpoena to the Department of Justice for its complete investigative files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The move signals growing pressure on the administration to provide transparency on the case, especially after the Justice Department asserted that no incriminating "client list" existed. The motion passed after three Republicans joined Democrats, breaking from House GOP leaders who had resisted the action. The subcommittee also approved subpoenas for Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and several former high-ranking government officials.</p>

However, the company's gross profit margin on vehicles was better than many analysts had feared, coming in at 17.2%. Despite the disappointing overall results, the news of progress on a lower-cost model and a potential expansion of its robotaxi service is intended to reassure investors about the company's future growth prospects.</p>
