          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's stock price increased by over 25% following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing an all-cash takeover offer for the entire company. While no formal offer has been received, the news reflects ongoing consolidation trends in a media industry challenged by the shift to streaming. This potential acquisition comes as Warner Bros. Discovery was planning to separate its television networks from its studio and streaming assets, a move that would be superseded by the reported bid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining elevated at 2.9%, seniors on fixed incomes face significant challenges to their purchasing power, prompting a closer look at annuities as a potential solution. Financial experts caution that traditional fixed annuities can see their value eroded over time, as the guaranteed payments buy less each year. The article suggests considering alternatives like variable or indexed annuities, or adding an inflation protection rider to a contract, to better hedge against rising costs and preserve quality of life throughout retirement.

          <p>A majority of Elon Musk's vast fortune is now derived from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, rather than his publicly traded company, Tesla. With SpaceX's valuation potentially reaching $400 billion and xAI's surging towards $200 billion, his stakes in these ventures are worth nearly twice his Tesla shares. This shift in wealth concentration is a key argument in Tesla's proposal for a new, massive pay package for Musk, intended to ensure he remains focused on the electric vehicle company amid his other growing enterprises.

A recent survey found that nearly half of BNPL users have missed a payment, highlighting the risks of what is often perceived as a simple payment tool. To manage this debt, the article suggests strategies such as consolidating balances with a personal loan, using a balance transfer credit card, or creating a strategic repayment plan before the new credit reporting changes take effect.

          <p>The race for the UK Labour Party's deputy leadership has narrowed to a contest between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. The only other candidate, Bell Riberio-Addy, failed to secure enough nominations from fellow MPs to proceed. The election was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner and will be decided by a ballot of party members in October. The contest will determine a key figure who acts as a link between the party membership and its leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates has spurred a surge in demand from homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%, its lowest point since last October and the largest single-week decline in a year. This decrease, driven by signs of a weakening labor market, has led to a notable increase in both home purchase and refinance applications, offering a potential boost to the housing market after a prolonged period of higher borrowing costs.

          <p>A federal judge has extended a ban preventing federal agents from using "less-lethal" weapons like projectile launchers and tear gas against journalists, legal observers, and peaceful protesters in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera criticized federal officers for unleashing such weapons "indiscriminately and with surprising savagery" during past demonstrations. The ruling is a significant victory for civil liberties and press freedom advocates, who argued that judicial intervention was necessary to protect 1st Amendment rights and curb excessive force.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Patrick Reed has voiced his opposition to the decision to pay American players for their participation in the Ryder Cup, calling the move "unnecessary." The U.S. team members will receive a $200,000 stipend in addition to a charitable donation, a departure from the tradition of playing for country and honor. Reed, a former Ryder Cup standout, compared the event to the Olympics, arguing that some events are about more than money and that European teams benefit from a stronger sense of camaraderie.</p>

The official COLA, which is designed to help benefits keep pace with rising prices, will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October after final third-quarter inflation data is calculated.
