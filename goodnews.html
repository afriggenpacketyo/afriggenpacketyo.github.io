          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of semiconductors. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, is centered on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at Samsung's new facility in Texas. Musk emphasized the strategic importance of the partnership, suggesting the deal's value could ultimately exceed the initial figure and noting his personal involvement in accelerating manufacturing efficiency. This agreement is crucial for Tesla's AI development and a significant order for Samsung's foundry business.</p>

          <p>Despite the England women's national team securing a historic victory in the Euro 2025 final, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a celebratory bank holiday. A homecoming parade is scheduled, and the team will be honored with a special reception. The decision aligns with past precedents, such as the 2022 Euros win and the 1966 men's World Cup victory, with government officials likely considering the significant economic cost of an extra public holiday. Prime Minister Keir Starmer had previously expressed support for such a celebration.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper front pages are dominated by celebrations of the England women's football team's victory in the European Championship. Headlines have declared the Lionesses the "Queens of Europe" and praised individual players like goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, dubbed "The Hann of God." Many papers framed the win as "revenge" for their World Cup final defeat to Spain two years prior. The triumphant and celebratory media coverage reflects the national pride following the team's dramatic penalty shootout win in the final.</p>

          <p>After 74 years of scientific expeditions and planning, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River downstream hydropower project in Tibet. Premier Li Qiang announced the groundbreaking at a ceremony in the city of Nyingchi. The project, located on a major river that flows into India, is set to become the world's largest hydropower dam. The initiative's origins trace back to China's first comprehensive scientific expedition to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1951, marking the culmination of decades of research and strategic planning for the region.</p>

          <p>The new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union is being framed as a significant win for President Donald Trump, though not an outright defeat for the EU. The deal sets a 15% U.S. tariff on many European goods, which is higher than previous rates but lower than the 30% that was threatened. The EU managed to secure this rate for key exports like cars and has avoided a full-blown trade war, which provides some economic stability amid sluggish growth in Europe. In return, the EU has committed to significant purchases of U.S. energy and military equipment.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen has mandated a new policy of leniency for researchers and companies whose state-funded innovation projects fail to meet their goals. The rules state that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, the individuals involved should not be punished or hindered from receiving future funding. This initiative is designed to encourage innovators to "boldly explore uncharted territories" without the fear of failure. The policy applies to a range of scenarios, including technical difficulties or unforeseen market changes that render a project unviable.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, which sets a 15% tariff on many European goods, has been met with mixed reactions across Europe. While leaders from Italy and Ireland cautiously welcomed the deal for providing stability and averting a worse outcome, the powerful Federation of German Industries (BDI) called it an "inadequate compromise." The BDI criticized the acceptance of "painful tariffs" and the lack of a deal on steel and aluminum. The agreement averts the 30% tariffs threatened by the U.S. but represents a significant compromise for the EU.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a trade agreement, averting a potential trade war just before a U.S. deadline. The deal establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., a compromise from the threatened 30% rate. As part of the agreement, the EU will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. and purchase hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of American energy and military equipment.
