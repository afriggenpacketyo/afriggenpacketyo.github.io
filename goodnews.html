        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that prohibits local governments from adding fluoride to the state's public water supply, citing concerns about informed consent and medical freedom. The law does not ban fluoride entirely, as residents can still purchase fluoridated water from private suppliers. Supporters of the bill argue it protects individual choice and reduces reliance on centralized health mandates, while critics argue that fluoridation has long been used to combat tooth decay. The legislation also includes support for Florida's agriculture sector and restrictions on ESG practices targeting farmers.</p>
