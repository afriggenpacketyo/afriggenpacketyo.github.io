          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision follows a significant 50-basis-point cut in the previous meeting, leading the RBI to adopt a "neutral" stance while monitoring economic data. The hold comes as India faces potential tariff increases from the U.S. over its trade relationships with Russia. Despite recent low inflation figures, the central bank is exercising caution, though analysts suggest a rate cut could be possible later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The Fever, who were on a five-game winning streak themselves, played without their injured star rookie Caitlin Clark. The Sparks capitalized on their recently healthy and complete roster, with strong performances from Rickea Jackson, Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens. Despite a late-game surge by Indiana that narrowed the score, Los Angeles held on for the victory, improving their record to 13-15 and strengthening their position in the playoff race as they continue their impressive run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement that outlines a major media partnership. Under the proposed terms, ESPN would acquire NFL Network and other assets like NFL Fantasy, while the league would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN. This deal would integrate NFL Network into ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service and give ESPN distribution rights for the popular RedZone channel. The arrangement, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, is seen as a strategic move to bolster ESPN's content offerings and advance the NFL's long-term revenue goals in a changing media landscape.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is reportedly in early-stage talks with investors for a secondary share sale that would value the company at approximately $500 billion. The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares, with existing investor Thrive Capital possibly leading the round. This valuation marks a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation in March, reflecting the company's explosive growth and dominance in the generative AI sector.

          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, the focus is increasingly on preserving the firsthand accounts of the aging survivors, known as 'hibakusha'. With the average survivor now over 86 years old, their numbers are rapidly declining, creating urgency for museums and volunteer 'successors' to keep their stories alive. This article highlights individuals like 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who guides foreign tourists in Hiroshima, sharing the tragic history of the attack and the personal story of his great-grandmother, who survived the blast but later died of cancer. These efforts aim to ensure the human cost of nuclear weapons is never forgotten.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced that the state prison in Norco, a medium-security facility housing nearly 3,000 inmates, will close by fall 2026. The closure is attributed to a declining statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. No inmates will be released early; they will be transferred to other facilities. The future of the site, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel before becoming a prison, is uncertain, though local officials hope the historic property can be restored and repurposed to boost the local economy.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Setting Official Consumption Targets in National Planning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 22:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is emerging among Chinese economists and policy advisors over whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a national goal for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is crucial for expanding domestic demand and improving citizens' lives. They point to China's relatively low rate of 39.6% in 2023 as a key area for strategic focus. Opponents, however, question the operational feasibility of such metrics as official policy goals, highlighting a key point of contention in China's economic strategy discussions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who had an underwhelming start to the season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury, is showing signs of a strong comeback. After a difficult start to his MLB career, Sasaki has been progressing well in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and his command improving. He has also added a two-seam fastball to his arsenal, which the team hopes will make him more effective. While his role is uncertain, the Dodgers are hopeful that the Japanese phenom could become a valuable contributor, either as a starter or reliever, for their postseason push.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp's parent company, Meta, has announced the removal of 6.8 million accounts linked to fraudulent activities in the first half of this year. Many of these accounts were connected to organized crime centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to carry out investment schemes and other scams. The takedowns are part of a broader crackdown on criminals who hijack accounts or add users to group chats to promote their schemes. In conjunction with the announcement, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features to better alert users to potential scams, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker AMD reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. While quarterly revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, the company's earnings per share were slightly lower than predicted. CEO Lisa Su attributed a decline in AI business revenue to U.S. export restrictions on sales to China, which cost the company an estimated $800 million. Despite this, the company saw strong growth in its Client and Gaming segment and provided an optimistic sales forecast for the current quarter, expecting its newest AI chips to compete effectively with rivals.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from repurposing over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its congressionally allocated funds without authority. The judge stated that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funding for projects like flood mitigation. The injunction halts the reallocation while the court considers the states' full legal challenge to the cuts.</p>

          <p>A state-owned Chinese company is making significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, with plans to begin extraction this year after a 17-year delay. The project, one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, was stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. The Taliban government has announced a switch to more costly underground mining to help preserve the historical relics at the site. This development signals a renewed push by China to advance its economic interests in Afghanistan, capitalizing on the country's vast mineral resources under the new regime.</p>

While violent crime and property crime are at multi-year lows, experts note that aggravated assaults remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. The report also documented over 11,000 hate crime incidents, with a slight overall decrease.</p>
