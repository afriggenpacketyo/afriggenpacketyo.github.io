          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the structure now weather-tight and key interior systems being installed. This new terminal, set to be JFK's largest, will exclusively serve international travelers and is part of a broader $19 billion airport overhaul. The first phase, featuring 14 wide-body gates and a light-filled design, is scheduled to open in mid-2026, ahead of the World Cup. The project also boasts its own resilient microgrid and unique duty-free shopping options.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History has announced it will update its presidential exhibit to properly reflect all U.S. impeachment proceedings, including those of Donald Trump. The statement followed a report that a temporary placard referencing Trump's two impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard's poor quality and placement, not external pressure, and confirmed a permanent update is forthcoming. This move aims to ensure the museum provides an accurate and complete historical account.</p>

The study analyzed the 100 largest cities based on factors including unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. These findings challenge the traditional dominance of major coastal hubs like New York and Los Angeles, suggesting that the "geography of opportunity" is shifting. Cities in the "Research Triangle" and those with strong tech, healthcare, and finance sectors performed particularly well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 09:57:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, effective handling of tantrums involves connection rather than control. The article suggests using calming phrases that validate a child's feelings, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you," instead of issuing punishments. This approach helps de-escalate a child's distressed nervous system by making them feel safe and understood. By modeling compassionate boundaries and reassurance, parents can help children learn to regulate their emotions, leading to fewer and less intense meltdowns over time.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. This official scheme follows a private initiative that has already brought a few children to the UK for complex, privately funded procedures. The government's plan, which could be operational within weeks, aims to allow up to 300 young people accompanied by a guardian to receive free medical care. The move comes after criticism that the government had previously declined to support such an evacuation.</p>

          <h2>Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) Movement Gains Traction Among Younger Generations</h2>

          <p>The FIRE movement, which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early, is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue aggressive saving and investing strategies to exit the workforce decades ahead of traditional retirement age. Adherents focus on extreme frugality and maximizing savings to build a nest egg large enough to live off of investment returns, often calculated as 25 times their annual expenses. Proponents argue the philosophy is not about deprivation but about aligning spending with true values to buy freedom. The movement emphasizes experiences and time over material possessions.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, NBA star Stephen Curry recently stated he does not know his exact net worth and prefers not to focus on it. Instead, Curry says he concentrates on building a portfolio of investments and opportunities that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day management to his financial team. Financial planners commented that this approach can be healthy, as it prioritizes long-term goals and values over a single, often misleading, metric. They advise focusing on tangible goals and cash flow management for a better sense of financial control.</p>

          <p>A widely circulated photo from 2002 showing former President Bill Clinton receiving a shoulder massage from Chauntae Davies, who later became an accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has been confirmed as authentic. The image was taken at an airport in Portugal during a refueling stop on a humanitarian trip to Africa. Davies, who was 22 at the time, has stated that Clinton was a "perfect gentleman" during the trip and that no foul play occurred. The photo's resurgence has renewed discussion about Clinton's association with Epstein and his circle.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully developed a new cryogenic steel, CHSN01, capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures and immense magnetic forces inside a nuclear fusion reactor. The material addresses a critical challenge that has hindered fusion energy development for decades, as previous materials became brittle under such conditions. This breakthrough has already been deployed in the construction of the world's first fusion nuclear power generation reactor. The development represents a major milestone for China in materials science and its ambitions to lead in the field of clean energy.</p>
