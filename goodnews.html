          <p>The UCLA Bruins are preparing for their Men's College World Series opener against Murray State, marking their first appearance since 2013. The team's journey back to Omaha has been fueled by resilience and a strong sophomore class, overcoming a challenging 19-win season last year. UCLA has a unique advantage, having played at Charles Schwab Field during the Big Ten tournament, giving them familiarity with the ballpark. Coach Savage emphasizes maintaining an edge despite their previous experience. The Bruins' pitching staff receives a boost with the addition of Cody Delvecchio, adding depth for the tournament.</p>

          <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress that lawmakers would be involved in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance. This commitment came after reports questioned the future of the security pact between Australia, Britain, and the US. Concerns were raised about the short timeframe for analyzing the alliance, which is seen as a counter to China's regional influence. China has expressed opposition to Aukus, criticizing it as a bloc confrontation that amplifies nuclear proliferation risks. The Aukus pact was launched in 2021 to counter China's growing power.</p>

          <p>Kweichow Moutai, China's premier liquor brand, is adapting to renewed austerity mandates from Beijing by distancing itself from extravagant lifestyles. Management has pledged to comply with strictures emphasizing thrift, which has impacted the brand's presence at government banquets and narrowed profit margins. Executives vowed vigilance against corruption at a company meeting, emphasizing that the liquor should promote culture, health, and harmony. Moutai's liquor has historically been the drink of choice for officials and executives, often given as official gifts and featured at lavish dinners. The company is now navigating a shift towards more moderate consumption.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed support for Chinese students in the United States, pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This statement contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration aimed at limiting or blocking international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized the benefits Chinese students bring to American schools and the country. He also supported allowing them to be hired by American companies, suggesting that if they are not allowed to stay, they will return to their countries and start businesses there. Trump's stance marks a notable shift in his administration's approach to Chinese students.</p>
