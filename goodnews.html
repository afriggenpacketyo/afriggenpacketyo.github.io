        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 16% in their Hong Kong debut, driven by investor confidence in the electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the raised funds to construct its upcoming factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients, including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China. </p>

          <p>China is increasing its influence in Latin America by offering financial support, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions, contrasting with President Trump's tariffs and immigration restrictions. Xi Jinping announced a $9.1 billion credit line and visa-free entry for tourists from several Latin American countries during a CELAC summit. This strategy positions China as a reliable partner and advocate for free trade, while Trump's policies are perceived as nationalistic and detrimental to the region.
