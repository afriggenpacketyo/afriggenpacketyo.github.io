          <p>The Trump administration is planning to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's "Quiet Skies" program, which monitors travelers deemed to pose an elevated risk to aviation security. The program, initiated in 2010, utilizes analysts and air marshals to track individuals in airports and during flights based on various data points, including outstanding warrants and suspicious travel patterns. The program has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes and has ensnared high-profile individuals. The decision to end the program comes after debates about its effectiveness and concerns over potential privacy violations. There is a degree of optimism as the government is considering to end the surveillance program.</p>

Hurley, who previously declined an offer from the Los Angeles Lakers, is committed to his role at UConn, where he recently signed a six-year extension. The college coach is focused on building his legacy at UConn, despite the allure of NBA opportunities. </p>

Judge Brian Murphy ordered the man's return after the Department of Justice admitted its claim that he had not feared being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information. The man, identified as OCG, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic attacks in Guatemala. The Trump administration has been ordered to provide OCG with due process if they attempt to deport him to a third country. </p>

Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with trying to smuggle strains of Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. for research purposes. However, scientists say F. graminearum is common in native grasses and crops across the country, causing a crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab.
