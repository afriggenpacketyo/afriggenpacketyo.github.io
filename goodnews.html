          <p>The Director of National Intelligence has announced the release of 230,000 previously sealed government files concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The documents, now available through the National Archives, include details of the FBI's investigation, internal memos, and information regarding potential plots. In response, Dr. King's family urged the public to view the files within the historical context of the FBI's extensive surveillance and disinformation campaigns against him and the Civil Rights Movement. The family stated they will review the documents to see if they offer new insights beyond what they have already accepted about the assassination.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:41:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current volatile rate environment, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering unusually high interest rates, making them an attractive option for parking significant sums of cash. However, savers should consider several factors before committing funds. While a short-term CD can provide protection against market fluctuations and offer a fixed return, longer-term CDs may yield more interest over their full term despite having a slightly lower rate. Furthermore, the most competitive CD rates are typically found at online banks, which may require savers to move money away from their traditional, local banking institutions.

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave increased after the company revealed plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds due in 2031. The capital raised from this sale is intended for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of existing debt. This move follows a previous $2 billion debt offering in May that was heavily oversubscribed and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, CoreWeave's CEO has affirmed that the company is meeting strong demand signals from major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft.

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that the approximately 700 active-duty Marines deployed to Los Angeles in June will be withdrawn. The troops were sent to the city, alongside a federalized California National Guard contingent, to protect federal property during widespread protests against new immigration policies. The deployment was controversial, with California's governor arguing it was unnecessary and could escalate tensions. A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the decision to redeploy the Marines was made as "stability" has returned to the city. About 2,000 National Guard members will remain in the area to continue protecting federal assets.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage designed to appeal to health-conscious consumers. This move comes just months after the company acquired the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion, signaling a strategic pivot towards the growing functional beverage market. The new drink will contain three grams of prebiotic fiber and five grams of cane sugar, differing from classic Pepsi's use of corn syrup. This launch aligns with PepsiCo's effort to innovate its product line as traditional soda consumption declines and consumer demand for drinks with perceived health benefits increases.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with high credit card debt, a debt management program can be a viable solution, but enrollment is not automatic. To qualify, individuals typically need to meet three main requirements. First, they must have a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new consolidated monthly payment. Second, the debt must be primarily unsecured, like credit cards or personal loans, and fall within the program's limits. Finally, applicants must commit to the program's rules, which usually include closing the enrolled credit accounts and participating in financial counseling. (not investment advice)</p>

In a recent interview, the "Piano Man" singer stated that he feels good, despite the condition being referred to as a "brain disorder," which he says sounds worse than his actual symptoms. NPH involves excess fluid in the brain and can affect balance, cognition, and vision. The update comes as HBO airs a two-part documentary, "Billy Joel: And So It Goes," chronicling his life and legendary career in music.</p>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, shared his top tips for surviving an encounter with a shark. He advises to first stay calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract the shark's attention. Second, he recommends maintaining eye contact and standing your ground, as sharks prefer to ambush prey from behind and are less likely to attack if they know they are being watched. As a final resort, de Gelder suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away, rather than punching it.</p>
