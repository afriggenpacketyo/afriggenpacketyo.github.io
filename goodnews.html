          <p>In a powerful reinterpretation of American history, 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee, are now part of an art exhibit in Los Angeles. The exhibit, titled "Monuments," aims to confront the "Lost Cause" ideology by highlighting the figures' association with white supremacy and slavery. Curator Hamza Walker emphasized that the statues, once symbols of division, are being transformed to spark dialogue about the nation's past. This initiative contrasts with calls from some political figures to reinstall such monuments, showcasing a contentious debate over historical memory.</p>

          <p>Hollywood actor Cate Blanchett has partnered with Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) to advocate for seed conservation, celebrating its 25th anniversary. Blanchett, who lives locally, expressed awe for the project, which stores over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species globally. Originally a "doomsday vault," the MSB now focuses on using its collection to restore threatened environments, including chalk grasslands and areas affected by wildfires. Blanchett highlights the critical role of seeds in safeguarding biodiversity and providing an "insurance policy" against environmental destruction.</p>

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing rapid growth, expanding three times faster than the firsthand market and projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. This surge has made authentication a critical factor, as sophisticated counterfeits, or "superfakes," pose a significant challenge. Resale platforms like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in verification systems, combining visual inspections, AI, and proprietary databases to ensure authenticity. This focus on trust and verification is boosting business and attracting a new generation of luxury consumers, who prioritize affordability and access to rare items. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, filed by Elon Musk's companies, alleges an anticompetitive scheme by Apple and OpenAI in AI markets.

Later, the "Strategic Emerging Industries" (2011-15) focused on green technology and rare earth monopolies, positioning China as a global leader. More recently, "High Quality Development" (2021-2025) aims for technological dominance, sparking geopolitical tensions and trade disputes with Western nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a minor wrist sprain during a preseason game but is expected to be ready for the regular season opener. The injury occurred from a hard fall after catching a lob pass from Luka Doncic.

This ongoing learning curve highlights the challenge of building team chemistry with a new point guard.

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational V-levels for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify England's "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, focusing on practical skills and employment pathways. Ministers also propose an alternative qualification to reduce the number of students resitting maths and English GCSEs. While some warn V-levels may not fully fill the gap left by BTecs, the initiative seeks to offer clearer routes for students, potentially allowing them to combine V-levels with A-levels.</p>
