        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and Japan have finalized a significant trade deal, which includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%. President Trump announced the agreement, stating it also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The news caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks, with companies like Toyota and Honda seeing significant gains. This development provides short-term relief for Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy that had been hit hard by previous tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

At 45 years old, Williams defeated 22-year-old Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4, marking her first singles win in nearly two years after a long absence due to surgery. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, showed flashes of her classic power, delivering serves over 110 mph to the delight of the supportive crowd.

          <p>Forwards Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang have become instrumental "super subs" for England in their run to the Euro 2025 final, drawing comparisons to the impactful duo of Russo and Toone from Euro 2022. Both players have made crucial contributions off the bench, with 19-year-old Agyemang scoring late equalizers in both the quarter-final and semi-final. Kelly, who scored the winning goal in the 2022 final, provided a decisive assist and a winning goal in extra time in the 2025 knockout stages. Their clutch performances have been vital in turning games around and propelling the Lionesses forward.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century vessel with a storied history as both a warship and a whaling ship. Originally HMS Hind, the frigate served in the Royal Navy during the expansion of the British Empire before being sold and repurposed for hunting whales in the Arctic. Using dendrochronology and historical records, researchers and a dedicated local community team pieced together its identity after it wrecked in 1788. The discovery highlights the rich maritime history of the Orkney Islands and showcases a successful model of community-driven archaeology.</p>
