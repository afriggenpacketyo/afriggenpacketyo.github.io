          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children develop exceptional social skills not just from learning manners, but from early environmental factors. Parents who foster these skills tend to openly discuss feelings, model empathy in daily interactions, and build authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. They also teach conflict resolution, validate their child's emotions, and prioritize listening over lecturing. These practices help build a foundation of emotional safety, which is crucial for developing socially aware and resilient adults.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has declared that reforming the welfare system is a necessity that must proceed. The government aims to provide skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits who currently have no work requirements, addressing both rising costs and individual well-being. This comes after the government abandoned a previous plan to cut disability benefits, but McFadden insists that reform is not stalled. The goal is to move away from a "binary divide" of fit or not fit for work, offering more tailored support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers on the island of Nantucket are developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local mouse population. The project, led by scientists from MIT and Tufts University, aims to make the white-footed mice—the primary carriers of Lyme bacteria—immune to the disease. By immunizing the mice, ticks that feed on them would not become infected, thereby breaking the transmission cycle to humans. The team is engaging in extensive community outreach to ensure public buy-in before releasing any engineered animals into the wild.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing ideological openness and the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat the self-censorship and lack of intellectual diversity they see on other campuses. For its inaugural class of 92 students, tuition is free, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations. The curriculum emphasizes Western civilization and seminar-style classes, aiming to foster genuine debate rather than political conformity.</p>

          <p>A special "super generation" of monarch butterflies, capable of living up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, undertakes an extraordinary migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to Mexico. These butterflies suppress their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the 3,000-mile journey, navigating with internal compasses. Their population has declined significantly over the last 30 years due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their caterpillars. Conservation efforts, like creating "Monarch Waystations," are underway to help preserve this remarkable natural phenomenon.</p>

          <p>This article suggests that Chevron is a strong investment for long-term growth, citing its robust balance sheet and low debt-to-equity ratio. The company's financial stability allows it to weather downturns in the energy market while consistently supporting its dividend for investors. By maintaining low leverage, Chevron can strategically take on debt during weak periods and pay it down when oil prices recover. The article posits that investing in an energy giant like Chevron can provide portfolio diversification and a hedge against rising energy costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the release of its new iPhone Air, Apple has signaled a deeper push into artificial intelligence by taking full control of its core chips. The new A19 Pro chip features neural accelerators on each GPU core to boost AI compute power, and Apple also introduced its own wireless (N1) and modem (C1X) chips. This move reduces reliance on previous suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm, allowing Apple greater control over performance, power efficiency, and user experience.

          <p>In an interview, Dong Yu, a key planner involved in drafting China's economic blueprints, explains the core principle behind the country's five-year plans. As the executive vice-president of the China Institute for Development Planning at Tsinghua University, he asserts that every chapter ultimately aims to boost national income and achieve sustainable progress. The five-year plans, once a symbol of a rigid planned economy, have evolved since the 1978 reforms. They now serve as a foundational guide for economic development, successfully meeting most of their set goals in the modern era.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. The White House suggests a deal is imminent, which could place the popular social media platform under powerful American control.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young saved a potential extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch after the ball was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes, dropping them into a tie for the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal where North Korea agrees to freeze its nuclear weapons program as a realistic interim measure. In an interview, he argued that while the long-term goal remains denuclearization, halting the production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually is a feasible alternative for now. This pragmatic stance marks a shift from demanding complete dismantlement, reflecting a desire to re-engage Pyongyang in dialogue. President Lee expressed hope that Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un could resume talks, leveraging their mutual trust to reduce tensions.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment the school's principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear inside a dumpster. As Marsh went to unlock the container, the bear's snout appeared from under the lid, surprising him and causing him to retreat quickly. The bear then climbed out and ran off in the opposite direction, and fortunately, no one was harmed. The incident serves as a public safety reminder about securing trash and other food sources to prevent potentially dangerous encounters with wildlife.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has announced it will increase patrols around synagogues and other Jewish community centers during the High Holy Days, which begin with Rosh Hashana. The move is a proactive measure intended to deter crime and provide reassurance amid a rise in antisemitic attacks across the U.S. since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Mayor Karen Bass affirmed that antisemitism is unacceptable in the city and thanked the LAPD for their efforts to protect Jewish Angelenos. The heightened security reflects a broader concern for the safety of religious communities.</p>

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli secured a 1-1 draw for Arsenal against Manchester City, thwarting a defensive tactical gamble by City's manager, Pep Guardiola. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, City shifted to an ultra-defensive formation in the second half, ceding possession in an attempt to protect their lead. The strategy nearly worked, but Martinelli's late goal salvaged a point for Arsenal at home. The result is a blow to both teams' title ambitions, leaving league leaders Liverpool as the primary beneficiary of the weekend.</p>
