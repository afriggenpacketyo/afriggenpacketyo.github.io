          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly autocratic government, demonstrating a remarkable show of solidarity across ethnic and religious lines. The article highlights a moment where Muslim students relieved protesting Christian students during Easter, and a war veteran extended greetings of peace. These protests, sparked by a train station collapse linked to corruption, have grown into the largest and most extensive movement Serbia has seen, calling for accountability and early elections. The government's attempts to quell the protests have failed, with nearly half a million people taking to the streets, showing the movement's deep reach into Serbian society and its potential to inspire similar movements globally.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that had contributed to friction between the two countries. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the Japanese temple. After the statue was stolen, South Korean authorities arrested the thieves and confiscated it, but a South Korean temple filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The South Korean Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses, siblings, parents, and adult children of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also be restricted from recruiting staff from abroad, and migrants will need to wait ten years to become British citizens. Prime Minister Starmer stated that new immigrants have to earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK. These measures are seen as an attempt to address concerns about rising legal migration and seize the narrative from surging Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>The US and China have indicated progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with both sides describing the discussions as "productive and constructive." US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in secretive closed-door discussions, the first meeting since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports. While a joint statement with full details is expected, some experts predict potential cuts to tariffs, although they would remain above historical norms. The announcement has led to gains in stock markets and a strengthening of the Chinese currency, signaling optimism about de-escalating the trade war.</p>
