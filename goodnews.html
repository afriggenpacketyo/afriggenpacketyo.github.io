          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which is expected to alleviate recent flight delays and cancellations. The airport has faced challenges including staffing shortages and technical issues, exacerbated by the runway closure. The Port Authority accelerated the construction timeline by hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors to ensure the runway met FAA safety standards. While the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber's delivery chief and a long-tenured executive, is leaving the company after almost 13 years. Gore-Coty joined Uber in 2012 and played a crucial role in the company's global mobility expansion and the development of Uber Eats. Andrew Macdonald, the senior vice president of mobility and business operations, will become chief operating officer, overseeing global mobility, delivery, and autonomous businesses. The leadership change comes as Uber reported strong first-quarter results, though it faces a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission over deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected an appeal from gun-rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, expressing a desire to address the issue nationwide. Justice Kavanaugh agreed with the decision but called the appeals court ruling questionable, anticipating the high court will weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the coming years. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons, particularly restrictions on gun kits. </p>

Neuralink's first system, Telepathy, involves threads inserted directly into the brain to translate brain signals into commands for external technologies. As of Monday, five patients have been implanted with Neuralink's technology, enabling them to control digital and physical devices with their thoughts. </p>
