          <h2>EU Considers Standardized Baggage Rules After Passenger Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 19:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is considering new laws to standardize sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, aiming to reduce passenger confusion and disputes over baggage fees. The proposal suggests a guaranteed free personal item measuring up to 40x30x15cm, including wheels and handles, for EU-based airlines. Consumer groups argue that the proposal does not go far enough, as it does not address charges for overhead cabin bags, while airlines maintain their baggage policies comply with the law and allow for lower fares. Consumer experts suggest passengers measure their bags after packing to avoid exceeding limits, and to consider airlines that include baggage without extra costs. The potential changes could impact UK passengers traveling to or from EU destinations using EU-based airlines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills," which contain freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to combatting drug-resistant superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can potentially replace harmful gut bacteria. Early data indicates that these pills can flush out superbugs from the bowel, addressing a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans. The trial, involving 41 patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London, has shown promising signals that poo pills could help tackle the rising threat of superbugs. The study also suggests the array of gut bacteria becomes more varied after the therapy, which is a sign of good health.</p>

The campaign, running since 2012, aims to curb overspending among Communist Party and government bodies, improve the party's image, and stamp out corruption. Analysts suggest the measures are also intended to ensure resources are used wisely to compete with the United States. The campaign seeks to identify politically loyal cadres for potential promotion, though questions remain about its effectiveness due to media control and enforcement challenges.</p>

Tuchel expressed dissatisfaction with the team's performance, particularly in the later stages of the game, and felt they lacked the seriousness required for a World Cup qualifier. Despite dominating possession, England struggled to break down Andorra's defense and were restricted to long-range efforts.

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the department's plans following the House settlement agreement, which allows schools to pay athletes directly. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing while maintaining Olympic sports programs and staffing levels. The school will also preserve scholarship limits to maximize revenue sharing for each player. Revenue sharing will likely follow a formula similar to the back-payment distribution, with football players receiving the largest share. NIL deals exceeding $600 will require approval from NIL Go to ensure fair market value.</p>

Gizmo could be seen standing on a branch before flapping her wings and soaring off into the air. The flight didn't seem to last long as Gizmo quickly disappeared from the main feed provided by Friends of Big Bear Valley. The eaglets have been practicing for several days, flapping their wings and jumping from branch to branch in preparation for their big moment. Gizmo took flight at 89 days old, after some "intense wingersizing sessions yesterday on the High Perch," Friends of Big Bear Valley wrote on Facebook.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards was tasked with rebuilding England after a brutal Ashes drubbing which resulted in heavy criticism of the team's attitude, culture and on-field performances. The legendary former captain has started her era as head coach with a T20 and one-day international clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side, but this was no surprise. There are much tougher tests to come, starting with India's arrival in late June before the very challenging prospect of a 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka at the end of September. The dominant manner in which they have been winning has put England in a good place.</p>
