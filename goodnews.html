          <h2>Oil Prices Plummet on Potential US-Iran Nuclear Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 06:00:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following Donald Trump's statements in Doha, Qatar, suggesting progress towards a nuclear deal with Iran. The article reports that Trump indicated serious negotiations were underway for long-term peace with Iran, shortly after an Iranian advisor signaled willingness to sign a nuclear deal contingent on lifting economic sanctions. Analysts predict that such an agreement could significantly increase Iran's crude oil exports, potentially adding one million barrels per day to the market, although OPEC+ might adjust its output plans to mitigate the impact. Iran's economy has suffered greatly since the US withdrew from the original nuclear deal in 2018.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's current Middle East tour notably excludes a stop in Israel, a move interpreted as a departure from previous administrations' unwavering support. The article suggests that while still rhetorically pro-Israel, Trump appears less concerned with aligning US and Israeli interests in the region. Examples include direct negotiations with Hamas and Iran without Israeli input, and the abrupt end to the US air campaign against the Houthis. This shift reflects a growing frustration with allies perceived as taking more from America than they give, and the rise of the "restrainer" wing within the Republican party, who advocate for reduced military involvement in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reportedly told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he prefers Apple to manufacture its products in the United States rather than expanding production in India. According to the article, Trump referenced Apple's $500 billion investment commitment to the US and urged Cook to prioritize building in America. Apple has been increasing its production in India to reduce reliance on China, where the majority of its iPhones are currently assembled. Trump's comments underscore his administration's focus on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US.</p>

The article reports that the economy grew by 0.7% from January to March, driven by increased consumer spending and business investment. While Reeves acknowledged the ongoing cost of living crisis, she highlighted the UK's potential to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7. However, analysts cautioned that the growth may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and rising employer taxes.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing a potential shift in its approach to sexual assault cases, with a recent conviction of actor G√©rard Depardieu signaling a possible change in the country's long-standing resistance to the #MeToo movement. The article states that this verdict, along with another recent conviction of a director, has given feminists hope that the justice system is beginning to take these issues seriously. However, challenges remain, including a high percentage of dismissed cases and a need for greater resources to address sexual violence complaints. The article notes that the number of women speaking out about sexual violence has surged in recent years.</p>

This was the trial of a man who was answerable to the law like all others, but of a man who was protected for decades, and who embodies a much bigger system.</p>

The agreement is seen as a first step, but differences in food production regulations could hinder a more comprehensive trade deal. British consumers prioritize food safety, animal welfare, and environmental protections, raising concerns about hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken.</p>

          <p>The ongoing tariff war between the US and China is expected to increase demand for refurbished goods, benefiting companies like ReturnPro that recirculate overstocked or returned items. The article explains that as retailers reduce orders for foreign goods due to tariffs, reverse logistics companies can help fill the gap by sorting, cleaning, and reselling returned products. The company sells more than 70 percent of the returns it receives on consignment from retailers. This creates an opportunity to bring items back to life that are already here and put them back into the supply chain.</p>
