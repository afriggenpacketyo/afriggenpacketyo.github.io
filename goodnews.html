          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth soared by 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a significant $1.6 billion stake in the company. This investment is being interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence in the health insurer, which has recently faced a Justice Department investigation and issued a disappointing earnings outlook. The move by the legendary investor has prompted a rally, with analysts suggesting it could mark a turning point for both the company and the broader managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent decline in mortgage rates, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.58%, has created favorable conditions for many homeowners to consider refinancing. Financial experts suggest that individuals with mortgage rates above 7% could see substantial savings, though they should weigh the benefits against closing costs and their long-term plans for the property. This downward trend is primarily linked to weakening economic data influencing 10-year Treasury yields, rather than direct changes to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate.

He stated that a successful outcome would be achieving a ceasefire agreement, which would pave the way for more detailed discussions involving Ukraine and European allies on complex issues like territory and security. Sullivan also noted that the threat of severe U.S. sanctions is a primary motivator for Putin's participation in the high-stakes diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>A powerful sonic boom startled residents across London, Essex, and other parts of southeastern England on Friday. The noise was caused by three Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jets that were scrambled from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft. The plane had lost contact with air traffic control during its flight from Nice. After the jets were launched, communication with the aircraft was re-established, and it was safely escorted to Stansted Airport, resolving the incident without further issue.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate reveals stark differences in home equity growth across the United States since 2020. West Virginia led the nation with a 450% surge, while other affordable states like Oklahoma and Kansas also saw massive percentage gains due to rising home values. This trend highlights how homeowners in lower-cost markets have built significant wealth. In contrast, Louisiana was the only state where average home equity declined, underscoring the fragmented nature of the national housing market's recovery and growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Bihar, India, where up to a third of harvests can be lost to spoilage from extreme heat, solar-powered cold storage facilities are providing a crucial lifeline for small-scale farmers. These off-grid units enable farmers to preserve perishable produce like potatoes and vegetables for weeks, allowing them to avoid forced sales at low prices and reduce significant food waste. While challenges such as upfront costs remain, government subsidies and community-based models are helping to expand access to this sustainable technology, boosting farmer incomes and food security.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley" reveals a lesser-known aspect of the late singer's life: his Latino heritage. The film centers on the perspective of his mother, Mary Guibert, a Panamanian-American who raised him largely on her own. It challenges the long-standing media narrative focused on his estranged and famous father, Tim Buckley, by detailing his upbringing in a Latino household. Through his mother's story, the documentary offers a new, intimate understanding of the artist and the cultural influences that shaped him.</p>
