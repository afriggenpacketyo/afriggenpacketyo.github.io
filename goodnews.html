          <p>A major exhibition in Trier explores the enduring relevance of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his Stoic philosophy, particularly in times of crisis. Marcus Aurelius, known as the philosopher-king, ruled during a period marked by wars, economic problems, and a plague. His writings in "Meditations," never intended for publication, emphasize equanimity, wisdom, justice, prudence, and moderation. The exhibition aims to inspire reflection on good leadership and its importance in today's polarized world, highlighting the virtues that distinguished good governance according to ancient standards. The museum directors believe that Aurelius would not have considered Donald Trump a good leader, but acknowledge that the emperor was a product of his time, accepting slavery and unequal rights for women. </p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the investment would create jobs and boost security, aiming to increase science and technology spending to over ¬£22.5 billion per year by 2029. Research backers have emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address challenges such as visa costs and university funding to secure the UK's reputation for science on the world stage. </p>

          <p>Archaeologists have excavated an ancient workshop on the Greek island of Paros, revealing unfinished marble sculptures and other artifacts. The excavation at the Floga archaeological site uncovered new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, indicating continuous use of the site over time. The artifacts included semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, with archaeologists noting the impressive height of the preserved walls. </p>

The agency posted a message on Facebook humorously reminding travelers that Costco cards do not count as REAL ID. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs to board domestic flights. Confusion may arise from the presence of stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant documents. </p>
