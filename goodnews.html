          <h2>Researcher Argues Cryptocurrencies Cannot Replace Gold as Safe Haven</h2>

          <p>According to a World Gold Council expert, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The expert notes that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which typically hedges against market volatility. He argues that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the marketing of cryptocurrencies as "gold 2.0" as a fallacy. The comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices due to Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. (not investment advice) The financial outlook seems mixed.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has climbed to nearly 30 years old, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average age of all mothers giving birth increased from 28.7 years old in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, while for first-time mothers, the average age rose from 26.6 to 27.5. Contributing factors include changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the increasing cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023, indicating a shift in social norms and health trends.

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure for Meta as part of a $14.3 billion deal, where Meta will acquire a 49% stake in the AI startup without voting power. Jason Droege, Scale AI's chief strategy officer, will take over as CEO, and a small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is bolstering the company's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google, and Wang will oversee AI initiatives. The investment and hiring of Wang will not impact Scale AI's customers, and Meta will not have access to its business information or data. The financial outlook for both businesses is stable.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of China, describes the nation as an "engineering state," highlighting its remarkable achievements in infrastructure and technology. China's subway stations, high-speed rail, dams, bridges, and high-rises showcase its obsession with building large public works. The country's STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one, and most top officials are engineers. In contrast, Wang calls the US the "lawyerly state," emphasizing the different priorities and focuses of the two nations. This shows promise for global technology.</p>
