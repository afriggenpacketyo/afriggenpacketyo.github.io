Musk thanked President Trump on X, noting that the DOGE mission to reduce wasteful spending will continue. As a special government employee, Musk was limited to a 130-day appointment, which he reached at the end of May. Musk's departure marks the conclusion of his scheduled time in the role, where he focused on streamlining government operations. The White House has begun the off-boarding process.

          <p>Salesforce reported strong quarterly results and guidance, yet the market response was muted due to investor skepticism about the source of the improved outlook. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share beat estimates, but the stock's initial jump was short-lived. Investors are cautious despite the progress in AI, particularly with Data Cloud and Agentforce, which have a combined annual recurring revenue of over $1 billion. The company also announced the acquisition of Informatica to strengthen its AI strategy, however, Salesforce is now seeing a benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar when the company was initially baking in foreign-exchange headwinds into its guidance.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed his commitment to manufacturing-led growth, emphasizing self-reliance in advanced manufacturing during a visit to Henan province. This strategy, long criticized by the U.S. and trade partners, could deepen global trade imbalances and conflict with the Trump administration's demands in ongoing trade talks. Trump wants China to address trade imbalances and end state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts suggest China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance. The last sentence may not contain the word "score."</p>
