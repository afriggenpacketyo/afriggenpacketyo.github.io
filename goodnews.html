          <p>In a lighthearted incident at Wildwood Devon, two five-year-old European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure. The park initiated safety protocols, moving visitors to a secure building, while the bears were not considered a public threat. The duo was later found in a food storage area, having consumed a week's supply of honey and other snacks before being safely returned. An internal investigation is underway to determine the cause of the operational error that allowed the escape.</p>

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that while the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chips, Chinese companies are making major strides in algorithm engineering. He highlighted the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. models like those from OpenAI using far less computing power, as a key example of this progress.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons and found that while family members were often buried together, genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that women likely remained in their family homes after marriage while men moved to join their wives' households. The findings challenge Western-biased assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>
