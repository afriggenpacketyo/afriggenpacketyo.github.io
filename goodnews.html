        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation remains subdued. Bowman's remarks align with fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a growing sentiment within the Fed to lower rates. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates to alleviate the national debt, but the FOMC voted to hold rates steady at their last meeting. Bowman believes the impact of tariffs on inflation may be less significant than initially anticipated, creating room for monetary policy adjustments (not investment advice).</p>

While the broader tech sector has rebounded strongly, Apple is trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages.

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced plans to construct a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant in upstate New York, marking the first major new U.S. plant in over 15 years. The project aims to add at least 1GW of nuclear power generation to support a reliable and affordable electric grid. While renewable energy groups criticized the decision, citing the potential for NYPA to build renewable sources instead, the development will test Donald Trump's executive orders to accelerate nuclear-power development. The initiative is intended to complement renewable energy efforts and advance New York's clean energy goals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay off medical or credit card debt first involves considering the impact on credit score, interest rates, and collection risks. Credit card debt can damage credit faster and compounds more quickly due to higher interest rates, while medical debt often has a longer grace period before affecting credit. Prioritizing credit card debt makes sense to protect credit and avoid compounding interest, while medical debt may be more negotiable. Proactive management of both types of debt is essential to avoid serious financial consequences.</p>
