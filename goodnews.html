          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have dropped to their lowest point in 2025, averaging around 8.23%, making it an opportune time for homeowners to consider this financing option. Unlike HELOCs, home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing stability against potential future rate hikes. The article suggests that homeowners with pressing financing needs, such as consolidating high-interest debt like credit card balances, should consider acting now. However, the article also cautions borrowers to carefully calculate repayment costs, as their home serves as collateral and could be subject to foreclosure if they fail to meet their obligations.

          <p>A federal judge issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of certain international students, finding that the administration's actions were likely unlawful. The case was brought by foreign nationals who were admitted to the U.S. through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, and who had their legal status terminated as part of the Trump administration's "Student Criminal Alien Initiative." The judge's order prevents immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs and requires the administration to reinstate certain international students' legal status.</p>
