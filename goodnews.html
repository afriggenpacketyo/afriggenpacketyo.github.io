          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed the Republican party's signature tax and spending legislation with a 51-50 vote, requiring Vice President JD Vance to cast the tie-breaker. The bill, a key priority for President Trump, extends tax cuts and boosts spending on border security and defense, while cutting funds for health and nutrition programs. The passage followed a marathon session and intense negotiations by GOP leadership to secure enough votes, overcoming opposition from three Republican senators. The legislation will now return to the House for final approval before heading to the president's desk.</p>
