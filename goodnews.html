          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, declared at his party's conference that they have a moral obligation to defeat Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. He positioned the Lib Dems as an alternative to both Labour and the Conservatives, offering "radical change" aligned with British values, in contrast to what he described as Farage's desire for a UK resembling "Trump's America." Davey acknowledged his party's challenge in the polls but emphasized the need to expose Farage and address voter concerns on issues like immigration and the cost of living.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, remains a crucial tool for retirees to manage healthcare costs not covered by Original Medicare. In 2025, monthly premiums for these plans can vary widely, from as low as $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive coverage, with average costs for popular plans typically falling between $90 and $300. The article notes that costs are influenced by location, age, gender, and the specific plan chosen, advising consumers to enroll when first eligible and compare insurers to find the most affordable rates.

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has surpassed Modelo Especial to become the best-selling beer in the United States, according to recent sales data. This shift marks a significant comeback for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot to Modelo two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline is attributed to challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base, which has been impacted by current immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley. The quake, which occurred just before 3 a.m., was widely felt across the region, waking many residents and causing shaking and loud noises, but no major damage or injuries were immediately reported. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system ran trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. The event serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the region.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid dismissed a heated sideline exchange with tight end Travis Kelce during their win against the New York Giants. Reid told reporters not to "make too much of it," attributing the spat to Kelce's passionate and emotional nature, which he said the team needed more of. This is not the first public confrontation between the two, who had a similar incident during Super Bowl LVIII. Reid emphasized his strong relationship with Kelce, viewing the interaction as part of the game's high emotions.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Gold tends to perform well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, and central bank purchases have further supported demand. For individual investors, experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than owning physical bullion, due to lower costs and higher liquidity. Financial advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of an expected White House announcement, Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, and medical organizations are pushing back against claims linking the painkiller to autism. Kenvue stated that sound science shows no causal link and that acetaminophen remains the safest pain relief option for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also noted a lack of clear evidence, highlighting a major 2023 study of 2.5 million children that found no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders from its use during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>A new deal has been proposed to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, placing the app's American operations under a new joint venture controlled by U.S. investors. According to a senior White House official, the venture will have a majority of Americans on its board, and the U.S. government will not hold an equity stake. The agreement is designed as a compromise to satisfy legal requirements in both the U.S. and China, aiming to secure the app for its 170 million American users.</p>

His case had drawn significant international attention and pressure, including from the UK government and human rights organizations, who now hope this pardon signals a broader shift in Egypt's approach to political prisoners.</p>

          <p>Amid political speculation, scientific experts maintain there is no established causal link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) and autism spectrum disorder. Researchers emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with strong genetic roots, involving hundreds of gene variants rather than a single cause. The rise in diagnoses is largely attributed to broader diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and better screening methods, not exposure to a single medication. The claim that vaccines cause autism has also been repeatedly and thoroughly debunked by extensive research.</p>
