          <p>To address China's declining birth rate and bolster its scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program. The initiative, starting with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (about $7,000) to female researchers under 40 who have recently returned from maternity leave. While the initial scope is limited, the program is seen as a positive step toward supporting women in science and encouraging childbirth among highly educated professionals. This dual-purpose policy aims to create a more "birth-friendly society" while retaining valuable expertise in crucial research sectors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the potential reasons behind Cristiano Ronaldo's rumored return to play in the United States after a 12-year absence. The author connects this development to the upcoming World Cup in the US and a shifting political climate under Donald Trump, suggesting it could be a strategic move for both Ronaldo's brand and FIFA. The piece reflects on Ronaldo's long absence, which coincided with sexual assault allegations that have since been legally resolved without charges. A return could signal a clearing of legal and public relations hurdles, providing a major boost to the American-hosted tournament.</p>

Japan secured its first medal with Hayato Katsuki winning bronze in the men's 35km race walk, an event described as "absolutely brutal" by the winner. The event marks a significant moment for Tokyo, hosting a major global sporting event with spectators four years after the fan-less 2020 Olympics. Organizers have adjusted start times for endurance events due to health concerns, as a heatwave is expected to intensify throughout the nine-day competition.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has seen record-breaking pre-order sales in China, indicating robust consumer interest despite some shipment delays. According to e-commerce platform JD.com, sales in the first minute of availability exceeded the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website and led to in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai being booked within minutes. This strong start suggests Apple continues to hold a powerful position in the competitive Chinese smartphone market.</p>

Paulikevitch, who performs in dresses to classical Arabic music, sees his art as a form of resistance and a revival of historical male dance traditions in the Middle East. His defiance comes amid a rise in crackdowns on LGBTQ+ expression in Lebanon, a country often seen as more tolerant than its neighbors.
