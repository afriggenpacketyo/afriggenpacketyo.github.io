          <p>Ryanair is demanding that some flight attendants in Spain repay salary increases received between October and March, following a legal dispute with the Union Sindical Obrera (USO). The pay rise had been agreed with another union, CCOO, but USO successfully nullified the deal in court. Ryanair claims the affected flight attendants were "overpaid" and plans to deduct the money from their payslips. USO is exploring legal solutions, while Ryanair declined to comment on the number of affected employees or the consequences of non-payment.</p>

He praised Speaker Mike Johnson for doing a "fantastic job" in navigating the bill through Congress. The bill faces a crucial vote in the House, where Republicans can only afford a few defections.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that could allow asset managers to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) share classes of existing mutual funds. This move would provide investors with more choices but also introduces potential tax risks. The SEC is considering the tax implications, as ETFs are structured to avoid capital gains taxes for remaining shareholders when others withdraw, a benefit not typically found in mutual funds. The SEC is working with firms to address concerns and ensure fair treatment for all investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot announced it will maintain its current pricing levels, despite concerns about tariffs potentially leading to price hikes. The company is working with suppliers to hold prices steady and shifting production out of China to avoid tariffs.

Home Depot aims to further reduce its reliance on China, with no single country outside the U.S. representing more than 10% of purchases within a year.</p>

          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has sparked debate about the stability of renewable energy sources. While the investigation is ongoing, some have blamed Spain's reliance on renewables. Experts suggest that the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources. Solutions include improving grid connections, better battery storage, and implementing technologies like virtual inertia. Investment in grids needs to double to support the transition to renewable energy.</p>
