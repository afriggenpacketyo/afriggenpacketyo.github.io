        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major food retailers in England to encourage customers to make healthier choices and tackle rising obesity rates. Under the plan, supermarkets and manufacturers will voluntarily implement strategies such as offering promotions on healthy food, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to make nutritious options more appealing. The initiative aims to improve public health and relieve pressure on the NHS, but some experts caution its impact may be limited without broader, more comprehensive changes to the food system.</p>

          <p>In an effort to improve its results at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy focused on communal living. Athletes are participating in a "virtual athletes' village" to simulate the unfamiliar and often challenging environment of an Olympic Games. The goal is to build team morale, foster a stronger sense of unity, and help swimmers learn to perform at their best even when facing less-than-ideal conditions, such as travel delays or shared living quarters, which they experienced in past competitions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To address a projected rise in skin cancer cases, a new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety. The initiative, which may be expanded nationwide, aims to instill lifelong protective habits by educating pupils on reading UV indexes, applying sunscreen correctly, and understanding when protection is necessary. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, making early education a key preventative measure against the most serious form of skin cancer.</p>

With a 98 percent success rate, the reliable H2A series is now being replaced by the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket, as Japan aims to enhance its competitiveness in the global satellite-launch industry.</p>

Supported by the city's mayor, the event transformed from a traditional Pride parade into a broader celebration of human rights and solidarity, with many attendees motivated to participate specifically because of the government's attempt to suppress it.</p>
