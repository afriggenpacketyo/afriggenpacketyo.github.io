        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is retiring its iconic "Blue Screen of Death" after more than four decades, replacing it with a black screen and a more streamlined error message. The change, part of a broader effort to improve Windows' resilience, was announced in the wake of the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage that affected millions of systems globally. This simplified user interface for unexpected restarts will be rolled out on Windows 11 devices starting later this summer. The new screen removes the sad face icon and displays a percentage for the restart process, aiming to make system recovery faster and less frustrating for users.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology company Xiaomi saw its shares surge to a record high following an overwhelmingly positive market response to its new electric vehicle, the YU7. The luxury SUV is priced competitively to undercut Tesla's Model Y in China and reportedly received over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its launch. This success follows the launch of its SU7 sedan last year, which was also priced below Tesla's Model 3. The company also announced other new products, including AI-connected glasses, signaling its continued expansion beyond consumer electronics into competitive tech markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Donald Trump may extend the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire on July 9. A spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical" and that the administration has had productive discussions with key trading partners, including Japan. Japan's top negotiator is currently in Washington for another round of talks, with a particular focus on the high tariffs imposed on the automotive industry. The potential extension offers a window for further negotiations to avoid escalating trade disputes and secure concessions beneficial to U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers actively traded up in the second round of the NBA draft to select Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. To secure the selection, the Lakers executed two trades, ultimately sending their 55th pick and cash considerations to acquire the higher pick. The team reportedly views the 6-foot-8 Thiero as a "super athletic wing" who can address their need for athleticism alongside their star players. In other team news, guard Austin Reaves has reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension, though he remains under contract for two more seasons.</p>

          <p>A large fireball, identified by NASA as a bright meteorite, streaked across the sky over Georgia and South Carolina before exploding with the energy of about 20 tons of TNT. The event, which occurred in the afternoon, created sonic booms heard by many residents on the ground. According to NASA, the meteor was approximately 3 feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and was traveling at 30,000 miles per hour when it entered the atmosphere. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight sighting, which may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>A single block in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is serving as an "urban laboratory" for combating the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense development traps heat. A local environmental group, GreenRoots, is testing multiple cooling solutions, including planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. This "cool block" initiative aims to provide a template for other cities as climate change intensifies heat waves, which can make some urban neighborhoods significantly hotter than surrounding greener areas. The project demonstrates practical, community-level strategies to improve public health and urban livability.</p>

The felony conviction forfeits his right to vote or hold public office, ending a controversial political career that attracted support from high-profile right-wing figures.

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive a newly licensed drug that offers a potential cure for a rare, life-threatening inherited immune disorder called APDS. The patient, Mary Catchpole, lost her mother and other relatives to the same condition, which was only identified in 2013 by Cambridge researchers studying her family. The drug, leniolisib, is the first targeted treatment for APDS and works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly. This breakthrough represents a remarkable journey from disease discovery to an approved NHS treatment in just 12 years.</p>
