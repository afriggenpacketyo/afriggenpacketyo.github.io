          <p>Hainan, a tropical island off China's southern coast, is positioning itself as a prime shopping destination to benefit from the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China. With policies allowing duty-free stores to offer competitive prices, Hainan is set to launch its own separate customs regime, avoiding the retaliatory tariffs imposed on American imports. The island hopes to attract Chinese shoppers seeking cheaper iPhones and U.S. cosmetics, potentially boosting its tourism sector amid sluggish domestic consumption. This strategic move underscores China's efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the trade war by promoting domestic consumption and tourism in designated regions.</p>

          <p>The British steel industry is experiencing a sense of relief following President Trump's decision to lift the 25% tariffs on steel exported to the United States. This trade deal is expected to alleviate pressure on struggling businesses like Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, which ships a significant portion of its steel to the U.S. However, uncertainties persist regarding the implications for products processed in the European Union before being exported to the U.S. The industry remains cautious, citing the Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies and the need for long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift was reportedly subpoenaed by Justin Baldoni's legal team in his lawsuit against Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, though Swift's representative denies her involvement in creative decisions for the film "It Ends With Us". The legal battle erupted after Lively accused Baldoni of orchestrating a smear campaign following her report of on-set sexual harassment. Baldoni then filed a countersuit alleging Lively's accusations were baseless and harmful. Swift's spokesperson clarified that her involvement was limited to licensing her song "My Tears Ricochet" for the film's trailer and a scene, dismissing claims of any influence over casting or script changes.</p>

          <p>Police in Bristol are cracking down on the commercial sex industry by targeting men who buy sexual services, aiming to combat night-time exploitation and harm. The Op Boss and Night Light teams engage with street sex workers while disrupting kerb crawlers, focusing on criminalizing the men rather than the women. This approach aligns with the National Police Chiefs' Council's recommendation to prioritize safeguarding vulnerable women and targeting offenders. The initiative involves issuing community protection warnings and offering courses to prevent reoffending, with the Night Light team also providing support and gathering intelligence on at-risk youth.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, drawn by generous tax incentives such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate, and lower labor costs. Blockbusters like Barbie and Jurassic World: Dominion have utilized UK locations and studios, resulting in significant cost savings. This trend has caused a decline in film and television production in Los Angeles, prompting concerns about the future of Hollywood. President Trump has proposed tariffs on films made in foreign countries, but the UK government is in discussions with the US administration to address the situation.</p>

While Google maintains that the settlement addresses "old claims" and that it has already changed product policies, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton emphasized that the settlement sends a message that Big Tech is not above the law. This settlement marks the largest amount won by any state in a settlement with Google over data-privacy violations.</p>
