          <p>Best Buy reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its recent quarter, showing a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, marking its highest growth in three years. Despite this modest recovery, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year guidance, citing ongoing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CFO Matt Bilunas expressed confidence in the second half but noted the prudence of maintaining current forecasts given the tariff situation. The company has already implemented "last resort" price increases on some items to offset higher tariff-related costs and launched a third-party marketplace to spur future growth.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce expressed willingness to work with the United States to effectively leverage existing economic and trade consultation mechanisms, resolve issues through equal dialogue, and jointly maintain healthy, stable, and sustainable relations. Li's trip, which followed a visit to Canada, indicates ongoing efforts to manage the complex trade relationship.

          <p>Botswana has achieved a monumental public health victory, reducing its childhood HIV infection rate by over 98% since the 1990s, when one in eight infants were infected. New cases in children are now exceptionally rare, prompting comprehensive audits for every diagnosis. This success is attributed to robust HIV prevention infrastructure, widespread free antiretroviral therapies since 2002, and early implementation of the WHO’s Option B+ strategy for pregnant women. Botswana is the first high-HIV-rate country to achieve Gold Tier status for eliminating mother-to-child transmissions, demonstrating what is possible with sustained political will and investment.</p>

          <p>The new movie "Splitsville" opens with a jarring scene of a car crash and a confession of infidelity, setting the stage for a comedic exploration of modern relationships. The film reflects a cultural anxiety about romantic commitment, depicting characters yearning for freedom while struggling with the desire for stability. It delves into the psychotherapist Esther Perel's idea that humans are torn between security and freedom, leading to dissatisfaction even in happy relationships. The article notes a trend in pop culture where romantic commitment is portrayed as a source of terror or discomfort, suggesting that humans are perpetually haunted by paths not taken.</p>

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicle (EV) models eligible for a new £3,750 government discount, including Ford's Puma Gen-E, to encourage drivers to switch from petrol and diesel cars. While 26 other models qualify for a £1,500 reduction, upfront costs remain a significant barrier for many drivers, despite the grants aiming to align EV prices with their petrol counterparts. The government plans to ban new petrol/diesel car sales from 2030 and address the need for more charging points. The initiative aims to make EVs more accessible and affordable for families.

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, leading to an upward revision of its full-year sales and earnings guidance. Comparable sales grew 5%, driven by increased average ticket and transactions. CEO Lauren Hobart attributed the performance to effective long-term strategies and consistent execution. The company's raised profit guidance accounts for current tariffs, with executive chairman Ed Stack noting "surgical" price increases. The upcoming acquisition of Foot Locker is expected to further strengthen its market position, particularly in athletic footwear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and Fox have agreed to a "short-term extension" in their contract dispute, preventing immediate disruption of Fox channels for subscribers. This agreement allows services like Fox Sports, Business, and News to remain available while negotiations continue for a new deal. YouTube had previously warned that Fox was demanding significantly higher payments compared to similar content providers, and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr urged a resolution, highlighting the impact on millions of Americans. This extension averts a blackout, similar to a past dispute with Disney, as both parties work towards a fair, long-term agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, which currently require properties to be let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates. The proposed amendments include allowing an average of 182 letting days over several years and counting up to 14 charity days towards the target. While the government says it has listened to feedback, industry groups like PASC UK Cymru criticize the changes as "token gestures," arguing the 182-day threshold continues to harm the tourism sector. The consultation period is open until November 20. (not investment advice)</p>
