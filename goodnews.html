          <p>The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square celebrated a historic milestone with the 5,000th episode of its "Music & the Spoken Word" program. The performance took place in Salt Lake City, Utah, before an audience of over 11,500 people. Originating in 1929, the program is the longest-running consecutive broadcast of its kind, having persisted through major historical events like the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic. The choir, once called "America's Choir" by Ronald Reagan, is seen by many as a source of comfort and unity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants 5-2 in an 11-inning game to win their divisional series ahead of the All-Star break. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings and striking out seven batters. However, the bullpen struggled, with closer Tanner Scott giving up a two-run homer in the ninth to tie the game. The Dodgers' offense rallied in the 11th inning, with key hits from Freddie Freeman, Teoscar Hernández, and Andy Pages to secure the win.</p>

          <p>After a decisive 6-1 victory over Wales, England's women's football team has secured a spot in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals. Despite an initial loss to France, the Lionesses bounced back with strong wins against the Netherlands and Wales, scoring a total of 10 goals in those two matches. Manager Sarina Wiegman's tactical adjustments, including moving Lauren James to a wider position and starting Ella Toone, have proven effective. The team now faces a tough quarter-final match against Sweden, a familiar and formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace announced that King Charles has invited President Donald Trump for a second state visit to the UK from September 17-19. The visit is scheduled while the House of Commons is in recess for party conferences, a move that avoids the potentially controversial prospect of Trump addressing Parliament. This decision comes after some MPs signed a motion opposing such an address, citing the president's past rhetoric. The visit, during which Trump will be hosted at Windsor Castle, is seen as a diplomatic opportunity for the UK government to strengthen ties with the administration.</p>

          <p>The perception of lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is shifting from an association with gangs and crime to a celebration of heritage, art, and community. Originating as a form of counter-culture for Mexican Americans after WWII, "low and slow" cruising is now being embraced, with cities like Santa Fe even declaring a "Lowrider Day." Car clubs and artists are now focusing on community service, such as organizing coat drives and mentoring at-risk youth through lowrider bicycle building projects. This transformation marks a redefinition of the culture, viewing it as a form of healing and a beacon of hope for the community.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG featured a pre-match and halftime show more akin to an American Super Bowl than a traditional soccer match. The event at MetLife Stadium included a military flyover, a performance by Robbie Williams, and a high-tech halftime show with artists like Chris Martin and Doja Cat. The spectacle also featured the attendance of US President Donald Trump, leading to heightened security and a celebrity red carpet. This fusion of global soccer with American-style entertainment highlights FIFA's strategy for the expanded tournament, though it caused significant delays to the game itself.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas housing market is experiencing a significant increase in inventory, with new listings up 77.6% year-over-year, the sharpest rise in the U.S. Real estate experts attribute the flood of new listings to a mix of factors, including retirees moving to be closer to family or to cooler climates. Additionally, investors who bought properties at lower prices are now cashing out amid cooling buyer demand due to higher interest rates. While this gives buyers more options, sellers are adjusting by offering concessions or reducing prices to remain competitive in the shifting market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an address, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that despite widespread personal and political criticism of Donald Trump, his presidency could be constructive for investments. Cramer posits that a rally is being driven by individual investors, who are less concerned with traditional orthodoxy and more focused on a pro-business environment. He argues that deflationary forces from artificial intelligence will offset inflation from tariffs, and that a deregulatory environment at the agency level is fostering deal-making and higher corporate profits. Cramer concludes that even those who dislike Trump may see their stock portfolios grow during his term. (not investment advice)</p>

The album follows a period of personal tumult for the artist and features a cooled-out, atmospheric sound with collaborators like Mk.gee. Unlike his more polished pop hits, "Swag" presents a more intimate and unvarnished side of Bieber, with tracks that feel like voice memos and lyrics that frankly address his life and marriage. The review describes the album as shaggy, disarming, and often beautiful, reflecting a more instinctual and authentic musical direction.</p>

          <p>To be in the top 10% of American households by wealth, a net worth of at least $2 million was required, according to the Federal Reserve’s 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. This figure is significantly higher than the median household net worth of $192,900, which represents the midpoint of all American families. The analysis notes that due to stock market gains and inflation since 2022, the current threshold to enter the top 10% is likely closer to $2.2 million.
