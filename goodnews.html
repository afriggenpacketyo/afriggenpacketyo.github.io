          <p>Major corporate conferences hosted by Goldman Sachs and Berenberg are highlighting a growing sense of optimism regarding Europe's economic future, particularly for Germany. Investment banks note a potential for Germany to overcome its recent economic underperformance, while London's Canary Wharf is experiencing a revival with office leasing expected to hit a decade high. This positive outlook is also mirrored in the private markets sector, with investors seeking to hedge against U.S. policy uncertainty.

          <p>Lucy Guo, a 30-year-old self-made billionaire who dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University, recommends that aspiring entrepreneurs still spend at least one to two years in college. Despite leaving her studies to accept a Thiel Fellowship and co-founding the successful company Scale AI, Guo emphasizes that higher education is invaluable for building a network. She argues that college provides a unique environment with a high concentration of intelligent people who are open to forming friendships, which can become crucial for future hiring and collaboration. This network of talented peers is one of the greatest assets a founder can have.</p>

Wide receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, accounting for 127 receiving yards and two touchdowns, including the crucial score that sealed the win in the fourth quarter. Despite a strong offensive performance with 517 total yards, USC's victory was complicated by defensive penalties that allowed Michigan State to remain competitive.

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had run a charitable training program in the country for years, were held under harrowing conditions since February without a publicly disclosed reason. Their release followed months of lobbying by their family, who had raised concerns about their deteriorating health in detention. Upon their return, the couple expressed relief and a desire to eventually continue their humanitarian work in Afghanistan.</p>

          <h2>China's Stalled Real Estate Projects Find New Use as Film Sets for Micro-Dramas</h2>

          <p>Amid China's ongoing real estate crisis, stalled commercial and residential property developments are being repurposed as lavish film sets for the country's booming micro-drama industry. The on-screen opulence of these short-form dramas, which often depict urban romance, contrasts sharply with the idle construction sites. This trend provides a new revenue stream for property developers facing cash flow shortages and project delays. The popularity of micro-dramas has surged, with viewership surpassing 660 million people and revenues overtaking the national box office for the first time in 2024.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is finalizing a deal with China that will allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under new oversight. According to the White House, the agreement will establish a board to oversee the app's U.S. operations, with Americans holding six of the seven seats. U.S. tech company Oracle will manage the data and privacy aspects, and the platform's algorithm will also be controlled within the U.S. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns about data privacy and Chinese influence, with the final signing expected to occur in the coming days.</p>

          <p>In an effort to improve safety within UK jails, Justice Secretary David Lammy has announced that 10,000 additional prison officers will be equipped with protective body armor. The initiative is part of a £15 million funding increase that will also provide 500 Tasers for specially trained staff. The move follows several high-profile attacks on officers, including an incident at HMP Frankland where three officers were hospitalized. Lammy stated the investment sends a clear message of support to prison staff and is intended to help restore order and security within the prison system.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Teams Arsenal and Man City Adopt More Direct Football Tactics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 01:15:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top Premier League clubs Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic traditionally associated with lower-league teams. This shift is seen as a response to the effectiveness of high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. By utilizing long goal-kicks and quick transitions, teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create scoring opportunities through players like Erling Haaland and Kai Havertz. This evolution demonstrates how top managers like Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are adapting their strategies to counter modern defensive systems.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, likely triggered by moonquakes. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. The findings, published in the National Science Review, have significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases on the moon. This discovery suggests that geological hazards from seismic activity must be considered in the planning and construction of any lunar infrastructure.</p>
