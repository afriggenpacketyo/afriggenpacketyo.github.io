          <p>The Defense Department has ceased requiring civilian employees to submit weekly reports detailing their accomplishments, a practice initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in February. Jay Hurst, performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, announced that employees should instead offer ideas to improve efficiency or eliminate waste. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by other agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. The weekly reports, involving a "five bullet exercise," were part of Elon Musk and DOGE's efforts to reduce federal government waste.</p>

          <p>The word "pride" has transformed from a vice to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment, with Pride month celebrations occurring globally. Originating from an "inordinate self-esteem," pride became associated with the LGBTQ+ community through the civil rights movement. L. Craig Schoonmaker advocated for "pride" as a rallying cry, emphasizing self-esteem rather than power. The concept of embracing "pride" allowed the LGBTQ+ community to reject negative labels and assert their worth, though debates about its use continue. The rise in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation underscores the ongoing importance of Pride as a symbol of resilience.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa will assume the role on June 23, with an extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for his election to the board. This decision follows Tavares' unexpected resignation in December, prompted by declining profits, sales, and challenges in the U.S. Filosa, a 25-year company veteran, previously served as Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer. Stellantis recently reported a 14% year-on-year downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties.</p>
