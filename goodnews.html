          <p>The U.S. Army will place large metal plates on Washington D.C. streets to protect them from damage during a parade featuring 25 M1 Abrams tanks, scheduled for June 14 to honor the Army's 250th birthday and coincide with President Trump's birthday. Concerns about the tanks' weight previously prevented their use in a parade during Trump's first term. The parade, estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, will include thousands of troops in historical uniforms and modern battle dress, along with vehicles and helicopters following a route from the Pentagon to the National Mall. The event will conclude with a parachute jump, concert, and fireworks display.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government is opposing a provision in the House Republican tax bill that would impose a 5% excise tax on remittances sent by non-U.S. citizens to their home countries, arguing it would harm the economy of both nations and disproportionately affect low-income migrants who already pay taxes. Mexico's ambassador to the U.S. has urged House leaders to reconsider, warning of unintended consequences such as migrants seeking unregulated channels for money transfers, increasing risks of financial insecurity and tax evasion. Representatives from the electronic payment transfer industry have also voiced concerns, suggesting the tax would drive consumers to underground channels to avoid the added cost.</p>

          <p>Epic Games said that its popular game ‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù will be offline on Apple devices because the iPhone maker blocked its recent app update. The dispute comes just weeks after Epic Games and other app developers cheered a judge‚Äôs ruling that limited the commissions that Apple makes through third party apps distributed through its app store. Epic Games filed its lawsuit against Apple in 2020. Apple is appealing the ruling and has said it strongly disagreed with the judge‚Äôs decision.</p>
