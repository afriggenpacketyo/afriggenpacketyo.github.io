          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany is prepared to purchase additional U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to send to Ukraine. The pledge was made at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome amidst ongoing Russian aerial bombardments of Ukrainian cities. Merz stated he has urged the U.S. to facilitate the delivery of more systems, sending a clear message of sustained support for Ukraine to both Russia and the United States. The advanced Patriot system is critical for intercepting ballistic missiles and aircraft.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight traveling from Madrid to New York with approximately 282 passengers and 13 crew members was forced to divert to an island in the Azores. The diversion was prompted by an indication of a mechanical issue with one of the plane's engines. The aircraft landed safely, and all passengers were provided with overnight accommodations and meals before a new plane transported them to their destination the following day. Delta has apologized and will offer compensation.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, climbing above $113,000 as investors moved into riskier assets and a wave of short liquidations fueled the rally. This recent climb, which also lifted other cryptocurrencies, follows a period of sustained strength, with Bitcoin trading above $100,000 for over 60 consecutive days. The momentum is supported by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and increased purchasing by public companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have announced a new migration agreement that includes a "one in, one out" returns pilot scheme. Under the plan, the UK would detain and return undocumented migrants arriving in small boats to France. In exchange, the UK would accept an equal number of legitimate asylum seekers from France who have family connections in Britain. The deal was announced by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron as a measure to deter illegal channel crossings.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, disaster preparedness experts are emphasizing key safety tips for such emergencies. Before a storm, it is crucial to understand your area's flood risk, establish evacuation routes, and pack a "go bag" with essentials. During a flood, the primary rule is to immediately seek higher ground and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters. Afterward, individuals should wait for official clearance before returning home and be cautious of hazards like downed power lines and structural damage.</p>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts, savers are advised to be more strategic with Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Experts warn against common mistakes, such as assuming CD rates will only change after an official Federal Reserve rate cut, as banks often act preemptively. Another pitfall is favoring slightly higher short-term rates over locking in a solid rate for a longer term, which offers better protection against future rate cuts. Savers should calculate their potential earnings to ensure a CD aligns with their financial commitment. (not investment advice)</p>

This combination of predictable income sources helps manage budget, taxes, and market risks, providing invaluable peace of mind throughout retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
