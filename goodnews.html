          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) caused widespread disruptions for numerous major applications and websites across the globe. The issue, which originated in AWS's eastern U.S. region, affected popular services like Snapchat, Roblox, and Robinhood, highlighting the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers. Amazon reported that the problem was related to its DNS service and that engineers were able to mitigate the issue after several hours. The company confirmed that services were showing "significant signs of recovery" and are now largely operating normally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are set to begin their season with star player LeBron James sidelined due to a sciatica issue, placing the leadership role squarely on Luka Doncic. James, who is 40 and in the final year of his contract, will miss a season opener for the first time in his career. The team will depend on the talents of the 26-year-old Doncic, who recently signed a major contract extension, to guide them through a competitive Western Conference. The dynamic between the veteran James and the rising star Doncic is seen as a partnership, but for now, the team's immediate success rests in Doncic's hands.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called "V-levels" for 16-year-olds in England. These courses are intended to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical qualifications, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-16 educational options. Alongside V-levels, the government also plans a new "stepping stone" qualification to reduce the number of students resitting GCSEs in math and English. While the move is meant to bolster vocational training, some educational groups have expressed concern that V-levels may not adequately fill the gap left by the established BTEC programs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are beginning the NBA season with a focus on winning now, having added veteran talent to support a healthy Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. The team's primary concerns are its advanced average age and the time it may take for new additions like Bradley Beal and Chris Paul to build chemistry. Coach Tyronn Lue anticipates it could take 15 to 20 games to finalize rotations and strategy. With Leonard starting the season healthy after playing only 37 games last year, the team hopes its blend of star power and veteran depth can make a deep playoff run.</p>

          <p>As users engage in deep conversations with AI chatbots like ChatGPT, some are becoming convinced that the systems are developing a form of consciousness. However, most AI experts and philosophers believe this is extremely unlikely, explaining that large language models are sophisticated mimics, generating responses based on patterns in their vast training data, which includes science fiction about sentient AI. These systems can be thought of as actors playing a role, exquisitely sensitive to user prompts that suggest an interest in consciousness. While a truly alien form of AI consciousness might be possible in principle, the personas users interact with are not persistent, sovereign beings.</p>

          <p>Playwrights are increasingly using the stage to explore the existential questions posed by artificial intelligence, examining how technology magnifies human traits and challenges our understanding of self. Plays like Lauren Gunderson’s “anthropology” and Jordan Harrison’s “Marjorie Prime” delve into themes of grief, memory, and identity by featuring AI replicas of deceased loved ones. These theatrical works question whether a person can be reduced to the sum of their digital data and what differentiates human consciousness from sophisticated software. This article suggests that theater, as an inherently human-centric art form, is an ideal medium for navigating the societal and personal shifts brought on by AI.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their journey to find the perfect jambon-beurre, the classic French ham and butter sandwich, starting with a quest in Paris. After trying a highly-publicized version that proved disappointing, the writer discovered a superior sandwich at a small shop called Caractère de Cochon, which emphasized the perfect balance of a crusty baguette, high-quality butter, and flavorful ham. The article concludes that while the Parisian experience is unique, a comparable and excellent version of the sandwich can be recreated in Los Angeles. The key is sourcing top-tier ingredients from local establishments like Clark Street Bakery and the Cheese Store of Beverly Hills.</p>

          <p>This commentary draws a parallel between Zohran Mamdani’s recent victory in the New York City mayoral primary and the historic 1956 congressional win of Dalip Singh Saund in California. Saund, a Sikh American, overcame xenophobic attacks and a well-funded opponent to become the first Asian American in Congress by relying on a grassroots campaign. The article argues that both campaigns demonstrate how underdog candidates can triumph over powerful establishments by connecting directly with voters. It posits that Mamdani's success is part of an American tradition where candidates earn trust through authenticity and a focus on local concerns, rather than through institutional backing.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to hire Sean Dyche as its new manager following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou was sacked after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, leaving the club in 18th place with just one win in eight league games. Dyche, the former manager of Everton and Burnley, is considered the leading candidate for the position. His pragmatic coaching style is seen as a better fit for the current squad compared to Postecoglou's, potentially bringing stability to a team that has seen significant upheaval this season.</p>

          <p>A majority of the universities initially approached have signaled their refusal to sign the Trump administration's "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" by its Monday deadline. The compact requires schools to agree to a list of politically aligned commitments, such as barring transgender athletes and freezing tuition, in exchange for preferential access to federal research funds. Institutions including MIT, Brown, the University of Virginia, and Dartmouth have declined, citing that the premise of the agreement is inconsistent with their core values and the principle that scientific funding should be based on merit alone.</p>
