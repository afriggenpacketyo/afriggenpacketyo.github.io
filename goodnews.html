          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has responded to a teammate's comment that distinguished between "entertainers and competitors," which was widely interpreted as a slight against him. Sanders stated that he is unaffected by others' words and had spoken with fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, who claimed the media had twisted his statement. Despite the clarification, Sanders expressed some ambiguity about whether he fully believed Gabriel's explanation. The situation adds a layer of interpersonal dynamics to the Browns' crowded quarterback room as the team prepares for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June but still higher than the 3% forecast by economists. A key factor in the cooling rate was the easing of rice price inflation, which had previously surged dramatically. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the Bank of Japan, held steady at 3.4%. This data comes as the central bank has recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the fiscal year, signaling persistent price pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing mounting debt from years of unprofitable harvests, has found a novel and successful alternative by pivoting to solar grazing. Instead of traditional farming, Chad Raines now rents his flock of 6,000 sheep to green energy companies to manage vegetation at large-scale solar farms. This innovative business model has proven highly lucrative, turning a significant annual loss from cotton farming into a substantial profit. The story highlights a creative solution for struggling small farmers and a symbiotic relationship between agriculture and the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction as investors anticipated Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium. South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a slight dip at the open. The cautious sentiment reflects global uncertainty about the future path of U.S. interest rates, with Powell's remarks expected to provide crucial clues. This follows a five-day losing streak for the S&P 500 in the United States, underscoring the market's sensitivity to central bank policy signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines urging baby food manufacturers to lower sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to the marketing of snacks for infants under one year old and restricts the use of unsubstantiated health claims on packaging. Companies have been given 18 months to comply, after which the government may consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes. The move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients.</p>

Simon suggested that investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues like restructuring costs.
