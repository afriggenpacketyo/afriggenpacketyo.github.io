          <p>Colorado Rockies relief pitcher Jimmy Herget humorously commented on his recent heavy workload by wearing a T-shirt that read, "My Arm Hurts" to a postgame press conference. This came after he was called to pitch for the fourth time in just seven days, a notable increase in frequency for a relief pitcher. Herget assured reporters that he felt fine and that the shirt was just a funny gesture, while his performance this season remains strong with a 2.73 ERA over 44 games. The lighthearted moment provided a glimpse into the physical demands placed on professional baseball players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes an innovative "scissor wing" design, a concept once explored by NASA. This design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At lower speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as the aircraft approaches hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire vehicle into a "waverider." This adaptable configuration aims to solve the classic aerospace challenge of balancing low-speed efficiency with high-speed stability and drag reduction.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party and event space now on the market for £3 million. The former CEO who purchased the abandoned property in 2017 for £555,000 undertook a challenging five-year project to make the historic building habitable, which had been without electricity or running water for 17 years. The renovated fortress now boasts 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, reviving its past reputation as a unique party destination. The extensive restoration required helicopters to bring in equipment and a team of workers living on-site for years.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents are sharing creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week school summer holidays when subsidized school meals are unavailable. Key tactics include meticulously planning meals, batch cooking, and strategically organizing the fridge to use items before they expire. Many parents rely on "yellow sticker" reduced-price foods, especially for meat that can be frozen for later use, and utilize food pantries that provide surplus groceries for a small fee. These methods help families stretch their budgets and minimize food waste amidst the financial pressures of rising living costs and increased childcare expenses during the break.</p>

          <p>The historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery, final resting place for numerous legendary film stars, has introduced a modern solution to its limited space: a new five-story vertical mausoleum. This architectural landmark, known as the Gower Mausoleum, provides housing for approximately 13,000 people and offers stunning views of Los Angeles. The cemetery has evolved into a cultural hub, hosting movie nights and festivals, making it a desirable location for final arrangements. The mausoleum's design emphasizes natural light and soothing marble, creating a peaceful environment for visitors and addressing the practical need for dense, permanent housing in a city where space is a premium.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds, just after returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. The letters captured their anxieties and hopes from that unique period, with questions about whether face masks were still needed and humorous queries about teenage life. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disrupted school transition, provided a poignant look back at their journey. The students reflected on how their entire secondary education was shaped by the pandemic, from learning in "bubbles" to the perseverance required to adapt to the challenging circumstances.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight Moses Itauma delivered a stunning performance, knocking out veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their highly anticipated bout. In his first headline fight, Itauma quickly overwhelmed the 37-year-old Whyte with powerful combinations, sending him to the canvas with a decisive right hook just 119 seconds into the match. The referee stopped the fight after Whyte managed to get back to his feet but was deemed unfit to continue. The victory extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0 and solidifies his reputation as one of boxing's most promising rising stars and a future contender for a world title.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing diners to the vast and diverse regional cuisines of China beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition at home, brands specializing in fiery Hunan dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using cities like Singapore as a test kitchen before launching in markets across Asia, North America, and Europe. These restaurants aim to correct outdated stereotypes about Chinese food being low-brow or unhealthy by offering sophisticated, authentic dining experiences, sometimes in immersive, culturally themed settings. This culinary expansion reflects a form of soft power, potentially helping to reshape global perceptions of Chinese culture.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share of shipments rising from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone slab. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly models to premium foldables costing over $2,000, has also contributed to its success. In response, Apple is expected to release a slimmer iPhone and may launch its own foldable device by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
