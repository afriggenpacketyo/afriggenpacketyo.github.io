          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." The move follows the collapse of a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe due to regulatory hurdles. Figma has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over 1,000 customers contributing at least $100,000 in annual revenue. In his investor letter, CEO Dylan Field stated the company intends to "take big swings," including potential acquisitions, as it transitions into the public market, marking a significant event for the tech IPO landscape.

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on the nature of long-term relationships through the lens of a road trip with her husband. The confined space of a car often magnifies a partner's quirks and differing approaches to challenges like navigation and traffic, leading to familiar arguments. The author humorously describes her husband's tendency to argue with GPS directions and personify other drivers as adversaries. Ultimately, the article suggests that navigating these small conflicts and accepting a partner's idiosyncrasies is a metaphor for a successful marriage, where the only viable option is to "proceed to the route" together.</p>

Despite Juventus showing early promise, Real Madrid dominated the second half but was repeatedly denied by goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.

          <p>France has implemented a new law that significantly restricts smoking in public areas, aiming to "denormalize" the habit, especially around children. The ban applies to spaces such as beaches, parks, bus shelters, and areas near schools and other public facilities, with violators facing fines up to ‚Ç¨700. This measure expands on previous bans on smoking inside restaurants and public buildings. While over 30% of French adults still smoke, a high rate for Europe, the government is focused on reducing tobacco's popularity among youth and curbing the 75,000 smoking-related deaths that occur in the country annually.</p>

In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3 and never fully recovering despite a notable effort from Tammy Beaumont, who scored 54.

While MLB stars like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values over longer terms, the NBA's salary structure allows for higher annual pay.

The provision would have applied a new tax to renewable projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a significant financial burden to the industry. While the tax was struck, the bill still phases out key investment and production tax credits for clean energy.
