          <h2>Japan Mandates Carbon Emissions Trading for Major Firms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 00:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has enacted a revised law that requires 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026, aiming to advance the country's green transformation and decarbonization efforts. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, covering industries like steel and car production, which account for approximately 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the trading system, companies receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding this threshold must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus, incentivizing emissions reduction. While intended to lower emissions, the new system may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on the costs of decarbonization. Optimism score must be a multiple of 5 between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger is retiring after leading the department through a period of rebuilding following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Manger addressed intelligence, communication, equipment, training, and leadership failures after the prior leadership lost confidence in the department. He successfully advocated for increased funding to improve hiring, equipment, and operations, and he claims the department now has a world-class intelligence operation. Manger has requested nearly $1 billion in funding for 2026 due to elevated threats against members of Congress, while a union representative noted that manpower remains an issue affecting morale.</p>

Despite US-China tensions, Whale emphasizes a global opportunity, with clients like Procter & Gamble and Watsons, and the company has raised $60 million in Series C funding. Ye believes the largest AI markets remain the US and China, with Southeast Asia likely to adopt scenarios from these regions, and he dismisses concerns about a shortage of AI computing power in China. Whale uses AI to enhance the customer experience at Starbucks, ensuring coffee orders are delivered within five minutes 98% of the time, and the company reported revenue of 230 million yuan last year, expecting 400 million yuan this year.</p>

          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals with experience in destinations like the Maldives and Bali, reveal the differences between living and working in paradise compared to vacationing there. LeBlanc notes that resort employees are often "locked" on islands, living in staff villages resembling summer camps, which can present challenges in managing a multicultural workforce. Robinson emphasizes the importance of ensuring employee happiness alongside guest satisfaction and highlights the maintenance issues caused by saltwater in island environments and humidity in the Cambodian forest, where they currently manage a luxury resort. The couple also face the challenge of living far from their families but have found success in working together for nearly two decades.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable not only as one of the first major cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its peculiar share distribution. The company plans to sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares, with the latter accounting for 60% of the total, which is rare in tech IPOs, save for Facebook's 2012 IPO. This move likely reflects the extended period of poor returns for venture capital firms, who are eager to gain liquidity after the market peaked in 2021. Circle, profitable with $64.8 million in net income in the latest quarter, expects to raise $240 million in the IPO.</p>

A study in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering revealed that even minor imperfections in tracks could cause violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, engineers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) say they have found a way to slash turbulence intensity by nearly half, reducing "extremely severe bumps" to levels that are "pronounced, but not unpleasant".

SpaceX noted that the mission achieved several milestones, including the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, and said it would evaluate the data to make adjustments for future missions. This iterative approach is part of SpaceX's strategy to develop a fully reusable spacecraft capable of sending humans to Mars.</p>

The ruling validates the strategy of fighting back against the administration, as judges have already rejected similar orders against Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block.
