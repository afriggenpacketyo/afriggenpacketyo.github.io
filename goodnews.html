          <p>The recent trilogy fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden serves as a powerful symbol for the evolution and complexities of women's boxing. The article contrasts the spectacle of the main event with the harsher realities faced by lesser-known female fighters, highlighting the sport's inherent contradictions. It argues that true equality in boxing is not just the right to be inspiring, but also the right to fight strategically, even if it results in a less thrilling match. The piece reflects on the fighters' call for the choice to compete in 12 three-minute rounds, framing it as a reclamation of their bodies for risk and glory, not just for traditional roles.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, identified as the largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock, known as NWA 16788, is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert. Found in Niger in November 2023, its Martian origin was confirmed by a specialized lab that compared its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The auction also features a rare juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton, highlighting a sale focused on significant natural history artifacts.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed struggle against the Turkish state, initiating a disarmament process that could reshape regional dynamics. This move follows a call for peace from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, with fighters symbolically destroying weapons in Iraqi Kurdistan. For the peace process to succeed, the PKK is demanding concessions from Turkey, including Ocalan's release and amnesty for fighters. A successful resolution could significantly improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria and enhance its diplomatic standing across the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, Live Aid is remembered as a monumental global event that united billions to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia, but its legacy is also viewed with critical hindsight. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 concert featured an unprecedented lineup of rock stars and set a new template for charity mega-events. However, critics point to its significant flaws, including the lack of African performers and female artists, which reinforced a 'white savior' narrative and a patronizing image of Africa. While Geldof defends the event's impact, which included raising millions and influencing political action on debt relief, the anniversary sparks a debate on its complex and enduring impact.</p>

          <p>A campaign is underway in the UK to require cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the currently used Latin-based scientific names. Proponents, including MP Becky Gittins who has a severe nut allergy, argue that the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system puts consumers at risk, as few people can understand the Latin terms for common allergens. Personal stories highlight the danger, such as a child suffering a severe allergic reaction to a body wash. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global harmonization, campaigners are pushing for clearer, more accessible labeling similar to food packaging to prevent potentially life-threatening reactions.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study offers preliminary evidence that China's massive dam projects on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that many have feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flow downstream during the dry season has actually increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This suggests that the dams regulate water, storing it during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods, which could potentially alleviate rather than create water scarcity issues for downstream countries like India. The findings provide a new perspective on a highly contentious geopolitical and environmental issue.</p>
