          <p>Dogs are increasingly becoming central figures in wedding ceremonies, with couples like Ellie and Brad incorporating their pets as ring bearers, greeters, and even in family portraits. This trend reflects a broader societal shift where nearly nine in ten people view their dog as a best friend and source of emotional support. Specialized dog chaperone services, such as Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party, are expanding rapidly to meet demand, assisting couples with planning and on-the-day pet care. These services ensure dogs are groomed, dressed, and managed, often "stealing the show" and adding unique joy to the special occasion.</p>

South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Topix recorded gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 experienced a slight dip after crossing the 9,000-mark the previous day.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly scaled back his threats of high tariffs on European pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, agreeing to cap duties at 15% in a new trade deal with the European Union. This marks a substantial reduction from the 250% and 100% tariffs previously threatened for these sectors, offering a crucial "shield" to major exporters like Ireland. However, the agreement states that a reduction of tariffs on European car exports from 27.5% to 15% is contingent upon the EU first passing legislation to eliminate its own industrial duties on U.S. goods. While hailed for offering predictability, the deal disappointingly excludes wine and spirits from tariff exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier order concerning stray dogs in New Delhi, now directing that the animals be caught for sterilization and immunization before being released, with exceptions only for those infected with rabies or exhibiting aggressive behavior. The court also prohibited public feeding of strays, mandating civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones and warning of legal action against violators. This modification follows widespread protests from animal rights activists against the initial August 11 order for mass removals, which aimed to address a surge in daily dog bite incidents. The court's decision seeks to balance public safety with animal welfare, intending to frame a nationwide policy on the issue.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate decreased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, registering its lowest level since March, though it still surpassed economists' Reuters poll expectation of 3%. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, while the Bank of Japan's closely monitored "core-core" inflation remained stable at 3.4%. A notable factor was the easing of rice inflation to 90.7% after two months of prices more than doubling due to shortages. Analysts suggest this moderation could support a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan in September or October, despite concerns that the central bank might be acting "too little too late" in combating inflation.

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of charges of insulting the monarchy, a verdict that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The accusation stemmed from a 2015 interview where he suggested "some people in the palace" were behind a military coup, but the court ruled he did not explicitly name individuals protected by the lese-majeste law. This decision brings significant relief to the Shinawatra family amidst ongoing political challenges, including the constitutional court case faced by his daughter, suspended PM Paetongtarn.

Researchers utilized isotope analysis on the tooth to reveal insights into the cow's diet, environment, and movement, linking its grazing patterns to the Palaeozoic rock formations characteristic of Wales. This study also provides the first new evidence since 2018 suggesting that cattle were employed as "beasts of burden" to transport the colossal stones to the ancient site, rather than solely human labor. The findings offer compelling new perspectives on the logistical complexities and community involvement during Stonehenge's construction.</p>
