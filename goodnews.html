          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would slow down the reduction of its government bond purchases starting in April of next year, while maintaining the benchmark interest rate at 0.5%. The central bank plans to decrease monthly bond purchases by approximately 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, then reduce it further to 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, targeting a monthly purchase amount of about 2 trillion yen. This adjustment aims to enhance the functioning and stability of the Japanese government bond markets, and the BOJ will conduct an interim assessment in June 2026. Following the announcement, the Nikkei 225 experienced a gain, and the yen strengthened against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys in 2025, with spot prices increasing by 30% year-to-date, prompting investors to reassess their safety strategies. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, unlike currencies and sovereign bonds. Instability, uncertainty, and concerns about the U.S. dollar and Treasury market have fueled demand for gold. While U.S. Treasurys experienced a sell-off due to tariff rollouts and credit rating downgrades, gold's value remains unaffected by debt-to-GDP ratios and political volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's directives to cancel several National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants were "void" and "illegal." The judge, William Young, stated that the cancellations, which targeted studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law by discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community. The ruling mandates the NIH to reinstate the terminated grants, estimated to be worth up to $1.8 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has expressed disagreement with the ruling and is considering legal options, while plaintiffs like Dr. Brittany Charlton celebrated the decision as affirming the value of their research.</p>

          <p>Southern Water, serving approximately 2.6 million customers in the south of England, including Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, has cautioned its customers about potential hosepipe bans due to a prolonged dry spring. The company is advising residents to take shorter showers and allow their lawns to turn brown, as the dry spell has negatively impacted local chalk streams and the Test and Itchen rivers, which are primary water sources. If river levels continue to decline, Southern Water may need to implement hosepipe bans or cease using these streams altogether to conserve water resources.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team of scientists has successfully used a 2-watt laser on a satellite in stationary orbit to transmit data to Earth at 1Gbps, which is five times faster than Starlink. The team, led by Wu Jian and Liu Chao, overcame challenges posed by atmospheric turbulence by using a combination of adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR). This innovative AO-MDR synergy allows for sharper light and the capture of scattered signals, even under strong turbulence. The breakthrough could enable the beaming of high-definition movies from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds.</p>

          <h2>China Hints at Imminent Commissioning of Advanced Aircraft Carrier Fujian</h2>

          <p>China has suggested that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned, with state media referencing an ‚Äúera‚Äù when the Chinese navy would have three carriers. New satellite images reveal 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, indicating a higher capacity than China‚Äôs existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping believes the new markings suggest the Fujian is preparing to be commissioned, potentially entering trial service for testing and coordination between the carrier, aircraft, and weapon systems. More sea trials and carrier group coordination exercises may be conducted before the Fujian formally enters service by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited pitching debut for the Dodgers in a 6-3 win against the Padres, marking his return to the mound for the first time since undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits, and touched 100 mph with his fastball. As a hitter, he struck out in his first at-bat but then tied the score with an RBI double in the third. The Dodgers plan to gradually increase Ohtani's pitching workload, with the goal of having him fully ready for the stretch run of the season.</p>
