          <p>Britain holds significant aspirations beyond the announced business deals during President Trump's second state visit, primarily aiming to refine the existing U.S.-U.K. trade agreement. A critical objective for the UK is securing the reduction of steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to zero, a move vital for protecting jobs in its vulnerable steel industry. Furthermore, the visit is intended to provide a much-needed confidence boost for the beleaguered British government, which has recently navigated a period of intense pressure due to tax rises and a major cabinet reshuffle. The UK seeks to leverage the pageantry and discussions to project unity, strengthen the "special relationship" with the U.S., and underscore its role as a global player amidst ongoing domestic political challenges.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu experienced a significant surge in its Hong Kong shares, climbing nearly 16% to reach a two-year high, primarily fueled by strategic advancements in its artificial intelligence initiatives. The company secured a major AI-related partnership with the state-owned China Merchants Group, specifically targeting applications for large language models, AI agents, and "digital employees." Furthermore, Baidu announced a substantial 4.4 billion yuan offshore bond offering, supplementing a prior $2 billion issuance, to aggressively fund its AI development and maintain a competitive edge. This article emphasizes Baidu's commitment to its AI business, including its Ernie Bot, and its efforts to develop internal chips to lessen reliance on external suppliers like Nvidia amidst shifting export controls.

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. is characterized by a lavish stay at the historic Windsor Castle, where he and First Lady Melania are being hosted by King Charles III. The elaborate itinerary includes occupancy of grand guest suites, full military honor guards, performances by three brass bands, and a highly anticipated banquet in St George’s Hall. This article meticulously details the extensive preparations and adherence to centuries-old royal traditions surrounding the event, emphasizing the significant pomp and pageantry of the nearly 1,000-year-old castle. Trump expressed his honor at being hosted by his "friend" King Charles, viewing Windsor Castle as the quintessential setting for this occasion, aiming to further solidify the "special relationship" between the two allied nations.</p>

          <p>Labour deputy leadership contender Lucy Powell, recently removed from her position during a cabinet reshuffle, has openly criticized the government's "unforced errors" concerning welfare policies. She asserted that proposed cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel payments caused voters to question the party's commitment to their well-being. Powell urged Labour leaders to be more explicit about their desire to abolish the two-child benefit cap and strongly refuted suggestions that her bid for deputy leadership was merely a proxy for other prominent male politicians. This article underscores her independent political voice and her stated intention to serve as a direct conduit for party members' views, especially on critical social welfare issues, within the Labour Party's leadership.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK offers a timely focus on pageantry for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has endured a challenging fortnight marked by intense scrutiny over a cabinet reshuffle and the Peter Mandelson scandal. The visit aims to highlight the "unbreakable friendship" between the nations and secure economic advantages, such as a significant new investment announcement from Microsoft. However, this article acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of the U.S.-UK relationship, citing ongoing steel tariffs as a point of contention. Despite the diplomatic bonhomie, underlying disagreements on sensitive issues like the recognition of a Palestinian state, the war in Ukraine, and questions surrounding Jeffrey Epstein are expected to emerge during political discussions, adding layers of complexity to the state visit.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is actively working to eliminate bureaucracy within the company, which he considers "anathema" to innovation and its entrepreneurial spirit. Speaking at Amazon's annual conference for third-party sellers, Jassy emphasized the critical need to reset the company's culture to operate more akin to the "world's largest startup." Key initiatives include a mandate to increase worker-to-manager ratios by at least 15% and the creation of a "no bureaucracy email alias," which has already resulted in changes to 455 internal processes. This article highlights Jassy's broader strategy to slash costs, including over 27,000 layoffs since 2022, and to invest heavily in artificial intelligence, all while striving to maintain a nimble and competitive edge across Amazon's diverse and expansive businesses.</p>

          <p>An opinion article advocates for Hong Kong to actively pursue co-hosting China’s proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, presenting it as a strategic alternative to Shanghai. While Shanghai possesses robust AI infrastructure and significant government support, Hong Kong's unique "one country, two systems" framework could provide invaluable international credibility, thereby assuaging Western skepticism amidst escalating U.S.-China tech tensions. This article suggests that Hong Kong's independent judiciary and established legal system could foster broader global participation, positioning the city as a crucial hub for China's AI diplomacy and enabling it to influence the shaping of global AI standards. Singapore is also highlighted as a credible alternative, primarily due to its comprehensive AI regulatory framework and proven governance expertise.</p>
