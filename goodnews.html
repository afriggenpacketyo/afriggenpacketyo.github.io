          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers star, hit his major league-leading 16th home run in a 6-2 loss to his former team, the Los Angeles Angels.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, finding that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, which led to genetic mutations that helped them adapt to extreme environments.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expressed their frustration on the course at the US PGA Championship, resulting in outbursts that could lead to fines. Shane Lowry angrily hit his club into the turf and swore after being denied relief for an embedded ball, while Tyrrell Hatton swore at his driver after a poor tee shot. Hatton acknowledged his behavior, attributing it to running hot in the moment. This is not the first time Hatton's temper has been seen on the course, as he was previously criticized for his behavior during the DP World Tour Championship.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election on May 18 that could determine the future of the pro-European government's reform plans, which have been hindered by the current president. The two front-runners are left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by the government, and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition. The election's outcome will decide whether Prime Minister Donald Tusk can advance his agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing abortion legislation, or if the existing political stalemate will continue.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates has been marked by honor and respect, with standing ovations, investment pledges, and awards. He announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and the three nations. The tour contrasted with backlash at home over his tariff policies and immigration crackdown. Trump also made campaign-style rallies at events and surrounded himself with friendly audiences, while gulf leaders highlighted deals with private firms unrelated to Trump's personal business interests.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment, aid, and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its wealth and influence. The UAE is investing heavily in key economic and strategic spots across the continent, such as ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. These efforts are part of an ambitious plan to increase the country's influence, particularly over global supply chains, as it seeks to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels.</p>
