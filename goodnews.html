          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools, benefiting mostly wealthier students already in private education. The signing marks the culmination of a long-fought battle over school choice in Texas.</p>
