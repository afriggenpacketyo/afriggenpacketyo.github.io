          <p>Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has made a significant investment of $900 million in real estate company Howard Hughes, acquiring 9 million newly issued shares. This deal increases Pershing Square's stake in Howard Hughes to 46.9% and reflects Ackman's strategy to diversify the company into a holding firm. The investment aims to enable Howard Hughes to acquire controlling stakes in other high-quality public and private operating companies, while continuing to grow its core real estate development and Master Planned Communities business. The purchase price of $100 per share represents a substantial premium over the stock's previous closing price.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that pro-family policies should embrace diverse family structures beyond the traditional model of married men and women. With American households changing significantly, policies should support single parents, unmarried couples, and those raising children with friends. The author contends that focusing solely on marriage as the ideal family structure is a moral and strategic mistake, and policies should instead lower barriers for all individuals hoping to start or support families.
