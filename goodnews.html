          <p>Quarterback Shedeur Sanders voiced his appreciation for President Donald Trump's public support after experiencing an unexpected drop in the NFL Draft. Trump had expressed his frustration on social media, questioning why NFL owners were not selecting Sanders earlier, citing his "phenomenal genes" and potential for greatness. Sanders, ultimately chosen by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round, acknowledged the widespread support he received from fans and others, including Trump. He will now compete for a starting quarterback position with the Browns, joining a crowded quarterback room.</p>

          <p>A preliminary 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, rattling homes and waking residents across parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina. The U.S. Geological Survey initially reported the earthquake as a 3.5 magnitude quake before increasing it to 4.1. While no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries were received, the USGS noted a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the coming week. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes in the eastern U.S. are typically felt over a larger distance due to the region's geology.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for a rapid end to its surprise heat wave, with cooler temperatures expected for Mother's Day and the potential for fog and drizzle early next week. After record highs in some areas, temperatures are forecast to drop by about 5 degrees by Sunday, bringing relief to residents. The National Weather Service anticipates temperatures to be below average by Monday, with the return of fog and breezes, and the possibility of light rain by Tuesday. This shift marks a return to more typical May weather conditions after an unseasonably hot spell.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, offering women a more convenient option for cervical cancer screening. The Teal Wand, developed by Teal Health, allows women to collect a vaginal sample at home and mail it to a lab for HPV testing. A U.S.-based study found at-home screening to be as effective as in-office procedures and preferred by women, potentially increasing screening rates. The self-testing device will be available by prescription through a telehealth service, initially in California, for women 25-65 years old who are at average risk.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean after 53 years in orbit. The mission failed due to a rocket booster malfunction, leaving the spacecraft stranded. The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War-era space race and the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. While the United States focused on Mars, the Soviet Union made significant strides in studying Venus, achieving several firsts in planetary exploration.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses his career and the importance of instinct over data in decision-making. Diller argues that relying solely on data can be harmful to creative and business decisions, emphasizing the value of simple human instinct and common sense. He shares anecdotes from his time at ABC, highlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were driven by instinct rather than extensive research. He believes that too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal.</p>
