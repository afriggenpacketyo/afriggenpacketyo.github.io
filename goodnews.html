          <p>China is proceeding with a monumental 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, considered one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects. The line will traverse extreme terrain, including glaciers and permafrost, at an average altitude over 4,500 meters, requiring immense engineering prowess. With an estimated cost potentially reaching US$56.2 billion, the project underscores Beijing's strategic focus on integrating and developing its western regions, despite the significant financial and construction hurdles involved.</p>

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will replace passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. The system requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first entry, with the registration remaining valid for three years. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns have been raised about potential delays and queues during the initial rollout phase, which will continue until full implementation in April 2026.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football coach, Steve Clarke, is determined to lead his team to the next World Cup, framing the goal as a chance to "put right" their failure to qualify for the 2022 tournament. He specifically recalled the painful 3-1 playoff loss to Ukraine, a match played under difficult circumstances that ended their hopes for a spot in Qatar. Having already guided Scotland to consecutive European Championships, Clarke is now focused on breaking the nation's 28-year drought from the men's World Cup finals.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the option for Muslim students and employees to take unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays has clarified existing legal practice. The move, which was initially misrepresented by some media as granting "extra holidays," reflects Germany's broader efforts to accommodate its evolving religious demographics within a framework of state-regulated public holidays. Legal scholars note the policy is not a new entitlement but an affirmation of constitutionally protected religious freedom, similar to provisions already in place for other non-Christian faiths across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has made a significant breakthrough in understanding plant biology. They discovered how a single differentiated plant cell can be reprogrammed to regenerate into an entire new plant by manipulating just two key genetic switches. This process, known as somatic embryogenesis, was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized egg cells. The findings, published in the journal Cell, offer profound insights into the fundamental processes of life and could have major implications for agriculture and plant science.</p>

          <p>A look at the performance of several major strikers signed during the summer transfer window reveals a mixed bag of results early in the Premier League season. While some, like Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres and Newcastle's Nick Woltemade, have made an immediate positive impact with crucial goals, others have had a slower start. Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak is still integrating into the team, and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko has shown flashes of promise. The analysis highlights the pressure and varying adaptation periods for expensive forwards in England's top flight.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her personal journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen investigated the process for a documentary, gaining rare access to Cardiff University's anatomy centre where her mother's body will eventually go. She learned how donated bodies serve as "silent teachers" for medical students, providing invaluable, hands-on learning that cannot be replicated by textbooks, and discovered the profound, lasting impact of this ultimate gift on future generations of doctors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite breaking goal-scoring records for both England and his club teams, a debate continues over whether striker Harry Kane is fully appreciated for his sustained brilliance. With 74 goals for England and over 100 for Bayern Munich, his statistics place him among the all-time greats. Pundits argue that his consistent, high-level performance and all-around game, including his ability to create plays, are sometimes undervalued compared to other top strikers. His humble demeanor and the immense pressure of captaining England in major tournaments may contribute to a perception that overlooks his true superstar status.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series, a matchup that presents several key challenges. The Brewers built their successful season on a disciplined, small-ball offensive approach, ranking high in on-base percentage and stolen bases rather than home runs. Their pitching staff is a major strength, boasting the second-best team ERA in the majors, led by ace Freddy Peralta and a deep, effective bullpen. Having been swept by Milwaukee twice in the regular season, the Dodgers will need to find a way to counter this well-rounded and resilient team.</p>
