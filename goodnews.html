          <h2>China Creates "Drone Flight Planner" as a New Official Occupation Amid Low-Altitude Economy Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially designated "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's low-altitude economy. This new role involves planning multi-drone flight paths, developing flight missions, and managing on-site operations. The move is part of Beijing's strategy to cultivate the low-altitude sector—encompassing activities up to 1,000 meters—as a strategic emerging industry. Officials believe this field will stimulate economic growth, drive innovation, and attract a new generation of tech-savvy young professionals to these creative roles.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, an ancient seismoscope reputedly invented by polymath Zhang Heng nearly 2,000 years ago. According to historical texts, the ornate device could detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, an achievement described as being "as accurate as the gods." Despite its legendary status, the invention's existence has been debated by some scholars, leading to its removal from school curricula in 2017. The new project, supported by modern science and new evidence, aims to restore the lost wonder and validate its historical significance.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed ICE train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The incident left passengers in the dark and without air conditioning shortly after the journey began. The evacuation was complicated and delayed when some passengers reportedly exited the train and began walking in the tunnel, forcing a secondary power-down for safety reasons. All passengers were eventually evacuated via emergency exits and buses, with two individuals receiving on-site medical treatment but no serious injuries reported.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge is heading to the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious injury to his ulnar collateral ligament. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis after Judge experienced difficulty throwing, providing relief to the team and its fans who feared a long-term absence. The two-time MVP received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks, with hopes of returning initially as a designated hitter. The injury comes at a critical time for the Yankees, who have fallen behind in the AL East race.</p>

          <p>Beyond his heavy metal legacy, Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered as a pioneering reality television icon for his role in MTV's "The Osbournes." The show, which ran from 2002 to 2005, offered an unfiltered look into the domestic life of the rock star and his family, blending mundane frustrations with their extraordinary fame. Producers described it as a "reality sitcom" that portrayed Ozzy as a lovable, often confused patriarch, a "Ward Cleaver on acid." This format was groundbreaking at the time, paving the way for a generation of celebrity-driven reality shows and endearing the "Prince of Darkness" to a whole new audience.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been declared a martyr by the Catholic Church, a key step toward sainthood.

A devout Catholic and member of the Sant'Egidio community, Kositi was known for his integrity and work helping street children. His "mafia-style" killing was meant as a warning against honesty, but his story is now celebrated as an example of choosing faith and justice over corruption.</p>

          <p>As football fans prepare for the emotional intensity of the Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the science behind match-day anxiety. The body's stress response, involving hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, is heightened in loyal fans, leading to physical reactions like an increased heart rate. Experts advise managing these effects by getting adequate rest, having a clear plan for the day, and engaging in movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that provides a rare license for emotional expression, regardless of the final score.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west over the Pacific than usual. This has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, leading to persistent cloud cover and increased coastal upwelling of cold ocean water. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California.</p>
