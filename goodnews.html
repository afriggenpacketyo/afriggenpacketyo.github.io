          <p>Elon Musk's attempt to revamp government efficiency through the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) has ended, but his companies are set to face reduced oversight. Musk's disruptive approach created both fear and anticipation before he gave up on his governmental role. Despite his departure, Musk maintains powerful friends in Washington, suggesting his influence will continue to shape policy and regulation. The long-term implications of Musk's involvement in government and his subsequent exit remain to be seen as his companies navigate a landscape with potentially less scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Texas Longhorns football coach Steve Sarkisian has refuted claims that the university spent $40 million to build its roster, calling the reports "irresponsible." Sarkisian acknowledged that the program has significant financial resources due to name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing. He suggested that $25 million was a more accurate figure for Texas' investment and emphasized that many other schools are also spending money to acquire players. Sarkisian's comments come after assertions that Texas' spending was comparable to or surpassed the $20 million spent by Ohio State.</p>

According to Japan Boxing Commission rules, a boxer who has had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license, meaning Shigeoka will retire from the sport.

          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates predicts a potential surge in global inflows to Chinese stocks, driven by investors reassessing their US-heavy portfolios. The firm suggests that undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China can "provide defense" amid geopolitical tensions. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities, particularly Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, have outperformed, making them attractive from a valuation perspective compared to expensive US stocks. With compelling valuations and falling interest rates, the case for diversifying away from US equities is strengthening.</p>
