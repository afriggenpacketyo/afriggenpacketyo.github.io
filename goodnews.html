          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto, directing her to withdraw a request to lift a federal judge’s order preventing LAPD from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The council's unanimous vote came ahead of "No Kings" demonstrations against the Trump administration, where journalists had previously reported excessive force. Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez emphasized that journalism is "under attack" and Los Angeles should not contribute to undermining court-ordered protections. This article highlights growing council frustration with the city attorney's office over legal costs and proactive litigation without council direction, questioning whose interests the office truly represents.</p>

          <p>A viral phrase, "6-7," originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," is causing widespread disruption in classrooms as kids and teens shout it out. Skrilla stated he never intended a specific meaning, allowing the phrase to become a positive and fun, yet often distracting, phenomenon. Some schools have banned it, while others, like Giano Intermediate, try to manage it by letting students release their energy or by joining in. Experts note the trend's longevity is unusual, amplified by social media and teachers' reactions, making it a generational "secret code" that kids enjoy.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Orange County have arrested Jacob Daniel Rodriguez, 45, dubbed "Postal Malone" due to his resemblance to the singer, in connection with a series of package thefts. The Irvine Police Department, which affectionately nicknamed the suspect, announced the arrest for burglary, stating "Things are 'Better Now' that Jacob Daniel Rodriguez...has been arrested." Rodriguez was captured on camera stealing multiple packages from an apartment community on Spectrum Center Drive, appearing to have facial and hand tattoos, similar to the actual Post Malone. Police had previously sought public assistance in identifying the suspect, noting his love for "post" things, including postal packages.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly apologized for his previous remarks supporting President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco. Facing significant backlash, Benioff stated he no longer believes the National Guard is needed for city safety, attributing his earlier comments to "an abundance of caution" for his company's Dreamforce conference. His initial stance, which also included expressing avid support for Trump, marked a shift from his past liberal policy advocacy. This article highlights how Benioff's apology comes amidst strong opposition from California and city leaders, who assert that federal intervention is unnecessary and unwelcome.</p>

          <p>This article explores the financial outcome of investing every Social Security check into the S&P 500 over a decade, addressing a common criticism that private investment accounts could yield greater wealth than the current system. Data from 2015-2025 suggests that consistently investing monthly Social Security benefits could result in a nest egg growing by over $20,000. The article highlights this potential payoff for seniors who can afford to invest their entire checks, aligning with financial advice from gurus like Dave Ramsey to collect benefits early and immediately invest them for growth. This analysis underscores the debate around the efficacy of public versus private retirement investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have reduced a felony charge against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, to a misdemeanor for obstructing federal officers during an immigration raid. Huerta was initially accused of conspiracy to impede an officer, a charge carrying up to six years in prison, but now faces a maximum of one year for "obstruction resistance or opposition of a federal officer." His attorneys assert that the charges are baseless and a politically motivated attempt to silence a leading critic of immigration policies. The article notes that Huerta was detained while exercising his First Amendment rights, with his arrest video going viral.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals "exciting results" for the Galleri blood test, which can detect over 50 types of cancer, including many without existing screening programs. The trial, involving 25,000 adults, identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with more than half detected at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood and correctly pinpointed the cancer's origin in 9 out of 10 cases. While impressive, scientists emphasize the need for further research, particularly a three-year NHS trial, to confirm if this earlier detection translates into reduced cancer deaths.</p>

In an era of sophisticated technological infrastructure, the emphasis should shift from connectivity to understanding its purpose, prioritizing innovation and cultural development over property-led growth. The article suggests Hong Kong has an opportunity to establish the Metropolis as a global cradle for cultural content, akin to the international influence of Hollywood or K-pop, thereby elevating the Greater Bay Area's development through cultural impact.</p>

Despite playing a man down for half an hour due to JJ van der Mescht's two sin-bins, Saints demonstrated superior form with a five-try bonus point win, taking them ahead of reigning champions Bath. Newcastle showed resilience, closing the gap twice, but ultimately couldn't capitalize on their numerical advantage, a lasting frustration for Alan Dickens' side.

          <p>Boeing has received FAA approval to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, a significant milestone nearly two years after a midair near-catastrophe led to production caps. The FAA had restricted Boeing to 38 planes monthly after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight due to uninstalled bolts. This increase signals the FAA's growing confidence in Boeing's production safety and quality, following extensive reviews. The move is crucial for Boeing's turnaround after years of issues, including two fatal crashes, supply chain problems, and a labor strike, as the company aims to balance inventory with its supply chain.</p>
