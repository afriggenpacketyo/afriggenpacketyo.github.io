        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With three days remaining before the UK's spending review, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has yet to agree to a funding deal with the Treasury, while Housing and Communities Secretary Angela Rayner reached a settlement. Ministers are engaged in talks with Chancellor Rachel Reeves regarding departmental budgets for the next few years. Cooper's reluctance stems from concerns over police funding, particularly in relation to recruiting the 13,000 new police and community support officers promised by the Labour party. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the need for police to embrace change and contribute to public service reform.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists recommend walking regularly to improve heart health, with any amount being better than none. The American Heart Association suggests aiming for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. This breaks down to about 30 minutes a day, five days a week, to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. It is important to adjust the general recommendation depending on individual health conditions and to consult with a healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, even the happiest couples encounter conflict, with common triggers including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone or attitude is a frequent source of conflict, signaling contempt, a predictor of divorce. Arguments about family relations often reflect misalignments and unmet needs, while those about chores often stem from the uneven distribution of labor. Ineffective communication can escalate conflicts, requiring strategies such as the "five-second rule" to pause and regain perspective.</p>
