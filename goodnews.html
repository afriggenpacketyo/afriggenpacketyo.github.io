        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches and their status as ultra-processed foods (UPFs). The author argues that this concern is another way of inducing maternal guilt, suggesting that mothers are often unfairly criticized for choosing convenience over homemade meals. She highlights the time and labor involved in preparing fresh baby food and the societal pressures on women to prioritize domestic work. The author ultimately advocates for a more supportive society that facilitates good food choices for parents and children, rather than placing blame on individual mothers.</p>
