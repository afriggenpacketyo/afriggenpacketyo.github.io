        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has pledged ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear project, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and enhance energy security, although Prime Minister Starmer stated he is "not writing a blank cheque" for the project. The project, which is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, has faced opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding, reducing reliance on other countries and tackling climate change. However, concerns remain about the project's total cost, with some estimates suggesting it could double the initially projected ¬£20 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a partial reversal of the government's decision to withdraw winter fuel payments from most pensioners, citing an improved economy as the reason. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. This decision follows pressure from charities, unions, and backbench MPs, after the government initially limited eligibility to only those receiving pension credit or other means-tested benefits. The government estimates the change will cost around ¬£1.25 billion and will be detailed in the autumn Budget.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven nations are likely to forgo a joint statement at the end of their upcoming summit in Canada, marking the first time since 2014 that the meeting would conclude without a consensus document. This move is intended to prevent the G7 from exposing internal divisions, particularly with the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. The summit will address global challenges, but disagreements on trade and climate policy may hinder the ability to reach a unified agreement.</p>

          <p>Apple's annual developer conference featured a significant software update, introducing a new design language called Liquid Glass, but it underwhelmed Wall Street due to a lack of splashy AI announcements. The Liquid Glass interface represents the first major redesign of Apple's iPhone operating system since 2013, promising a fresh look across all of Apple's devices. However, investors were hoping for more substantial updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system, but the rollout has been slower than expected. Analysts suggest that Apple needs to make bigger changes to its AI strategy to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI.</p>
