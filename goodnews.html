          <p>Google introduced AI Mode, a new artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored search responses. Building on AI Overviews, AI Mode represents a significant step in reimagining Search, leveraging generative AI technology. The technology summarizes search results and offers a sidebar with relevant links. While AI Mode aims to improve user satisfaction, concerns remain about potential factual errors and the impact on website traffic, as AI-generated summaries may reduce the need to visit source links directly.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland, a country known for its vibrant metal music scene. Lim's selection is not solely based on his musical fame, as he previously served as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung cited Lim's human rights work and international exchange experience as key factors in his appointment. Chthonic has used its music to highlight Taiwan's struggles for international recognition, given China's claim over the island.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the "Golden Dome for America," a multilayered missile defense system designed to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. The system would incorporate ground- and space-based capabilities to detect and destroy missiles, even those launched from space. China has criticized the plan, arguing that it could increase militarization of space and fuel an arms race. The initiative is still in the conceptual stage, lacking specific funding, but aims to counter both China and Russia's growing missile capabilities.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer announced a U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments following mounting political pressure. Over 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments after the pension top-up became means-tested last year. The policy change will be implemented at the autumn Budget, with the specific threshold for eligibility yet to be determined. The move follows criticism from unions, pensioner charities, and some Labour MPs who blamed the policy for recent election losses. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown supported the reconsideration, emphasizing fairness to pensioners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees should carefully consider HELOC borrowing options before tapping into their home equity, as financial flexibility is crucial for those no longer in the workforce. HELOC interest rates have been declining, making them an attractive option compared to credit cards and personal loans. A HELOC can function as a useful emergency fund, only requiring interest payments on the borrowed amount during the draw period. However, retirees must strategically approach their finances and assess their ability to repay, as failure to do so could result in foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Before applying for credit card debt forgiveness, cardholders should explore alternative relief options such as credit counseling, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans. Applicants should also assess their qualifications, including having a debt load of at least $5,000 to $10,000 and being delinquent on payments due to financial hardship. Gathering necessary documentation, such as medical bills or proof of job loss, is crucial for a successful application.
