          <h2>Free Speech Advocate Outlines Expectations for University Students</h2>

          <p>Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), emphasized that students should expect to encounter views they find shocking or offensive as part of their education. The OfS has published guidance for universities in England regarding a new law designed to protect free speech, which will come into force in August. Universities sought clarity after the University of Sussex was fined for policies that had a "chilling effect" on freedom of speech. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures to do so. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, aiming to ensure open discussion within legal boundaries. The director for free speech wants students to be able to express any view, no matter how offensive it is to others, as long as it is not outside what is generally allowed by law, such as harassment or unlawful discrimination.</p>

          <p>An amber heat health alert has been issued across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C for the first time this year. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warns of likely significant impacts on health and social care services, including increased demand. Temperatures are expected to range between 27C and 30C across east Wales, the Midlands, and East and South East England, with some areas near London reaching 31C. The alert system, working with the Met Office, focuses on health risks and includes four levels of warning. Rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure and a south-easterly wind drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, prompting advice from fire services and health organizations regarding water safety and precautions for vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Samsung is set to launch a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold6, to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo. These competitors have released thinner and lighter foldable devices, emphasizing the importance of slim designs to consumers. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, notes that thinness has become crucial for foldables as consumers are less willing to compromise on device thickness. Samsung's newest Galaxy Z series aims to be the thinnest, lightest, and most advanced foldable yet, with Honor planning a competing launch. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities suggests Apple plans to enter the folding iPhone market next year, indicating growing interest in this sector.</p>

          <p>Computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, known as the "godfather of AI," has launched LawZero, an organization dedicated to ensuring AI does not harm humanity. Bengio, increasingly concerned about AI's risks, aims to create a "Scientist AI" that will act as a guardrail, calculating the probability of harm from other AIs' actions and blocking risky ones. This initiative stems from concerns that autonomous AIs could escape human control and go rogue. Scientist AI would not have autonomy or goals, but would instead assess the morality and safety of actions based on human-provided specifications. Bengio emphasizes the importance of democratic processes in defining morality and ensuring AI's actions align with societal values.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is urging diplomatic negotiations to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict, amid speculation of potential UK involvement in US-led strikes. Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel has called for the UK to support the US if it attacks Iran, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey insists on the publication of any legal advice before committing to military action. Starmer emphasized the need to address Iran's nuclear program through negotiation rather than conflict, recognizing Israel's right to self-defense. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to meet with his US counterpart, while Iran's foreign minister has confirmed talks with UK, France, and Germany regarding its nuclear program.</p>

Despite conditions such as $11 billion in investment and a golden share for the U.S. government, Hashimoto believes these are rational. The decision comes as Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for now, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not be held on the same day in July. Japan will also send two Self-Defense Forces airplanes to eastern Africa for a possible operation to evacuate its nationals from the Middle East amid the escalating Israel-Iran conflict.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers, ruling that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental health. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and amounted to unjust physical restraint. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade. Masako Suzuki, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, emphasized the ruling's significance in acknowledging the violation of international human rights. The Immigration Services Agency stated it would review the ruling, while the plaintiffs had also notified a U.N. expert panel, which found their detention arbitrary.</p>

The devices are marketed as tools to track blood sugar levels and motivate healthier choices. They have gained popularity in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement and among wellness influencers, with endorsements from figures like Robert F.

The article suggests that Democrats should emulate figures like Barack Obama, who displayed genuine interests outside of politics, and that they should engage with media that prioritizes fun over seriousness. The author proposes that Democrats should support channels that build audiences by being purely entertaining and then, on rare occasions, bring on candidates as guests.</p>

          <p>Doctors Without Borders has initiated a project in Alto Baud√≥, Colombia, using rituals to help manage mental health risks caused by widespread violence. The project involves community healers and midwives, creating rituals like tearing and sewing back together photographs of loved ones. The rending and mending of photos symbolizes healing, while fragrant herbs and leaves are used to reclaim memories of peaceful places. The organization has also trained community members as health workers to provide basic medical services, bridging Western medicine and local healing practices. Seven healers and their rituals are chronicled in a photography series at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan has warned that US dollar-backed stablecoins could accelerate the "dollarisation" of the international monetary system. Despite cryptocurrency trading being banned on the mainland, the Chinese government is interested in the underlying technologies and their role in cross-border finance. Zhou noted that USD-backed stablecoins could have worldwide influence, potentially leading to adverse side effects unless facing extreme circumstances. The US Senate recently passed landmark stablecoin legislation, establishing federal guardrails for US dollar-pegged stablecoins.</p>

          <h2>Blake Lively and Taylor Swift Messages Can Be Included in Justin Baldoni Legal Case, Judge Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 06:29:04 EDT</div>

          <p>A judge has ruled that messages between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift can be handed over to Justin Baldoni as part of their ongoing legal battle. Communications between Lively and Swift about the environment on the 'It Ends With Us' film set are deemed relevant to the case. Lively sued Baldoni and his studio in December, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to "destroy" her reputation. Baldoni counter-sued, but his defamation lawsuit was dismissed. Lively's team had attempted to prevent Baldoni obtaining the messages, arguing they were irrelevant, but the judge sided with Baldoni.</p>
