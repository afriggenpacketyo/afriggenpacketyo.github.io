          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. This decision, revealed during the company's annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that Abel, the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment. Buffett stated he could still be helpful during periods of great opportunity, while Abel has been the designated CEO successor since 2021. Berkshire shares experienced only a slight dip despite the announcement and somewhat disappointing earnings, with the company also cautioning about potential tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>Temu, the low-cost retailer based in China, has stopped shipping goods from China to U.S. customers after the de minimis tariff exemption expired on May 2.

Now, Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all U.S. sales handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from within the country. The company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, aiming to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced that he will step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, recommending Greg Abel as his successor. Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies, has been the designated successor since 2021. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 and transformed MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, becoming a key figure in the company's utility operations. While Abel is highly regarded, analysts note he will face the challenge of matching Buffett's performance and operating with less control over the company's stock.</p>

The study also found that more people are sticking with therapy after starting it, with more visits recorded in a year for new patients.

          <p>Amid potential cuts to Medicaid and the dismantling of a federal agency supporting independent living for disabled Americans, Ari Ne'eman discusses the importance of the disability rights movement's history. Ne'eman points to the successful fight against Reagan-era cuts, which involved both massive mobilization and reframing disability rights in terms that appealed to a broad political spectrum. He also notes that disability remains a constituency with crossover appeal, making it a valuable focus in defending against cuts. Ne'eman also criticizes Secretary Kennedy's focus on preventing autism rather than improving services and support for autistic people.</p>
