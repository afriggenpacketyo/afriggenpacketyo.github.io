Analysts from Swiss banks and JPMorgan Private Bank predict further increases, with gold potentially reaching US$3,900-US$4,150 an ounce in the next year. This surge is attributed to gold's role as a portfolio diversifier and hedge against economic and geopolitical risks, alongside robust central bank demand and a weakening dollar. The article indicates a strong, positive market trend for gold investors, with 13 gold ETFs on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges returning 42% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a deal with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower drug costs in the United States to match prices charged in other developed countries. This agreement, a significant win for President Trump after years of failed attempts to curb drug prices, also includes Pfizer's participation in the new TrumpRx website offering discounted drugs. While new drugs will launch at parity prices, existing drug price reductions primarily apply to Medicaid patients. The article notes the deal was influenced by threats of 100% tariffs on non-domestically produced drugs, marking a shift in industry resistance. (not investment advice)</p>
