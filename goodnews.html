          <p>Famed astronaut Jim Lovell, best known for commanding the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. NASA and his family honored his legacy, highlighting his critical role in safely returning the Apollo 13 crew to Earth after an in-flight explosion. Lovell was a four-time spaceflight veteran, also serving on the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first to orbit the Moon. His career, marked by courage and leadership, was famously depicted in the film 'Apollo 13' and he remained a celebrated figure in the history of space exploration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin very soon to discuss the war in Ukraine, with a location to be announced shortly. The announcement coincides with a deadline Trump had set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant secondary sanctions on its oil customers. Trump expressed that he believes both Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy desire peace, suggesting a potential for territorial swaps as part of a complex resolution. This meeting follows increased pressure from the Trump administration to find a diplomatic end to the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, mistakenly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as potential illegal migrants, prompting an alert to authorities. He posted on social media demanding mass deportations before it was revealed the boat contained a crew raising money for motor neurone disease research. The rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident hilarious. After learning of his error, the MP, who has been a vocal critic of illegal immigration, pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed all federal agencies to delete records of employee COVID-19 vaccination status, noncompliance with past mandates, and exemption requests. Issued by the Office of Personnel Management, the guidance is framed as a reversal of 'harmful pandemic-era policies' from the previous administration. Agencies are now prohibited from using an individual's vaccination history in any employment decisions and must remove the data from personnel files unless an employee opts out. This move follows the 2023 repeal of the federal employee vaccine mandate, which had faced numerous legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the possibility of U.S. military operations against drug cartels within Mexico. Her statement comes in response to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to take action against Latin American cartels, which revived nationalist concerns in Mexico. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico collaborates with the U.S. on security issues, any presence of foreign troops on its soil is unacceptable and would be a violation of sovereignty. This stance is maintained despite the Trump administration's increasing pressure on Mexico to curb fentanyl trafficking, including the imposition of tariffs.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a historic peace agreement at a White House summit hosted by President Trump, aiming to end decades of conflict. The deal establishes a new transit corridor, named the 'Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,' to connect Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory. Both leaders praised President Trump's role in brokering the agreement, which signifies a major diplomatic achievement and a shift in geopolitical influence away from Russia in the South Caucasus region. The accord is expected to unlock significant economic and technological cooperation.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House appearance where CEO Tim Cook and President Trump announced Apple's plan to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, particularly the commitment to buy more American-made chips, has eased investor concerns about the potential negative impact of tariffs on the company's profitability. The successful meeting has been viewed as a masterful handling of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report from Realtor.com indicates a divided U.S. housing market, with home prices falling in some major metropolitan areas while rising in others. The largest price declines since the 2022 peak are concentrated in the South and West, including cities like Austin and Miami, where housing inventory has increased. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest, such as New York and Milwaukee, are seeing prices climb due to more limited housing supply. This regional variation is primarily driven by differences in inventory levels, with more new construction in the South and West creating a more balanced market. (not investment advice)</p>

This project aims to reduce reliance on foreign sources like China for materials essential for electric vehicle batteries and national defense.

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison. Her conviction stems from lying to a court that a chimpanzee named Tonka, who she was accused of mistreating, had died. In reality, she was hiding the primate in her basement to prevent his transfer to a sanctuary, an act she later admitted to in the documentary. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice, with prosecutors noting her lack of remorse and continued defiance of court orders.</p>
