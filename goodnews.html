          <p>SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship's 10th test flight was scrubbed for the second consecutive day, this time due to adverse weather conditions, specifically an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This milestone mission is critical for demonstrating fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, aiming to clear the path for a faster launch cadence. While SpaceX founder Elon Musk acknowledges "thousands of engineering challenges," particularly perfecting orbital refueling for NASA's 2027 moon landing, many observers and engineers doubt the system will be ready in time. The article highlights the significant hurdles remaining for the ambitious space program.</p>

          <p>Hangzhou, a prominent Chinese city, has implemented compulsory artificial intelligence (AI) classes in its school curriculum, reflecting a broader national effort to cultivate AI talent. This initiative aims to establish a robust talent pipeline and enhance educators' proficiency in utilizing smart tools while also addressing data protection. Schools are granted flexibility in integrating AI content, either through dedicated weeks or by weaving it into subjects like information technology and science. The article highlights that even young primary students will be introduced to everyday AI applications and the importance of responsible technology use, including privacy, underscoring China's strategic investment in future AI leadership.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully halted the progression of a brush fire that scorched approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek, on Monday afternoon. While the fire's spread is contained, full extinguishment requires the use of heavy equipment to address burned material along the control lines, with operations expected to extend into the early evening. No injuries were reported from the incident. However, fire officials have warned of potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway, which is already experiencing overnight lane closures due to a major repavement project. This event underscores the persistent wildfire threat in the region.</p>

          <p>Korean Air announced a substantial deal to purchase 103 Boeing aircraft, including 787, 777, and 737 passenger jets, immediately following a meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and President Donald Trump. This agreement is deemed crucial for modernizing Korean Air's fleet and maintaining competitiveness amidst its merger with Asiana Airlines. The timing aligns with Trump's broader strategy to encourage international partners to increase business with American companies, especially after the U.S. imposed tariffs on South Korea. Boeing lauded the "landmark agreement," estimating it would support around 135,000 jobs across the U.S. and bolster its market position against Airbus.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United endured a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat to Liverpool in a dramatic Premier League match, conceding a 100th-minute goal after valiantly fighting back from a two-goal deficit with ten men.

Fans' palpable frustration over Isak's unsettled status fueled the already charged atmosphere at St James' Park. Manager Eddie Howe acknowledged Isak's potential impact, emphasizing the urgent need for a resolution to the transfer impasse before the window closes, as it deeply affects team morale and strategic planning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the conventional wisdom about posture, suggesting that rigidly sitting "straight" all day can actually be detrimental to back health. Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a BBC presenter, outlines three key rules for improving back health: prioritizing consistent movement, building fundamental strength, and cultivating a positive mindset. He emphasizes that posture is inherently dynamic, not static, advocating for regular breaks and varied positions rather than prolonged stillness in any single posture. The article also highlights the importance of strengthening core and back muscles through simple exercises like pilates or yoga, and recognizing that stress and emotional factors significantly contribute to back pain, necessitating a holistic approach to overall well-being.</p>
