          <p>A California court has granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the California Coastal Commission, ordering Sable Offshore Corp. to halt construction and repairs on offshore oil pipelines until necessary approvals are obtained. The ruling supports the commission's claim that Sable violated the Coastal Act by performing work without proper permits. Sable insists it is operating under original permits and plans to appeal the decision, but the court sided with the Coastal Commission who argued that the work Sable performed falls under the definition of 'development' in the Coastal Act. The ruling comes after Sable resumed oil production at one of its offshore platforms.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that Beijing's increasing focus on marine science diplomacy could help calm tensions in the South China Sea. The region, rich in marine biodiversity and geological significance, offers opportunities for collaborative research and conservation efforts. China's investments in ocean technology, scientific expeditions, and international research partnerships position it to lead a collaborative marine science agenda. The vision of building a network of marine protected areas across the South China Sea could promote cooperation and shift the focus from conflict to shared scientific enterprise.</p>

The warehouse club retailer's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, and comparable sales increased 8%. Costco could benefit from rising economic worries and potential consumer price increases due to tariffs, as customers seek value and discounted goods. The company's strong buying power and supplier relationships allow it to negotiate prices effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
