          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 02:56:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld Illinois' ban on carrying firearms on public transit, reversing a lower court's decision that had found the restriction to violate the Second Amendment. The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the ban is consistent with a long-standing historical tradition of regulating firearms in "sensitive and crowded, confined places," such as public transportation systems. The court emphasized that while the Second Amendment protects self-defense, it does not prevent representatives from enacting laws to ensure public safety. This significant ruling, which could face an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, impacts gun owners and public safety measures across Illinois.</p>

          <p>Premier League teams have formally submitted their player rosters for the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League, navigating regulations that cap squad sizes and specify quotas for "locally trained" players. Several new high-profile signings, such as Florian Wirtz for Liverpool and Martin Zubimendi for Arsenal, are confirmed to participate. The squads also highlight emerging young talents, including Liverpool's 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha and Arsenal's 15-year-old Dowman, who stands to make history as the youngest Champions League player if he plays before his 16th birthday. However, key players like Gabriel Jesus and James Maddison are notably absent due to injuries, impacting their clubs' European campaigns.</p>

          <p>British boxing sensation Tiah-Mai Ayton, at just 19 years old, has boldly set her sights on becoming the youngest undisputed champion in the four-belt era, a record currently held by Gabriela Fundora at 22. With an exceptional combat sports background, boasting only three avenged defeats in over 300 fights across Muay Thai, MMA, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, and boxing, Ayton is preparing for her second professional bout. She aspires to achieve undisputed titles in four different weight classes, an unprecedented accomplishment in the sport. Despite her ambitious goals, the Bristol fighter, signed by Eddie Hearn, maintains a grounded perspective, with a long-term dream of living a quiet life on a farm.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 rose significantly, fueled by tech stocks like SoftBank Group, though Nidec Corp plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also climbed on strong household spending data. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated. Global bond markets remained a focus, with US 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% after a court ruling challenged Trump-era tariffs, and Japan's 30-year bond yield hitting a record high amidst inflation and political uncertainty.

          <p>Martha's Rule," a vital initiative empowering families to request an urgent second medical opinion for a loved one whose condition is worsening, is now being implemented across all acute hospitals in England. This significant rollout follows a successful pilot program in 143 sites since April 2024, which recorded almost 5,000 calls and led to 241 potentially life-saving interventions. The rule honors Martha Mills, a 13-year-old who tragically died from sepsis after her family's concerns were overlooked. Martha's mother welcomed the expansion on her daughter's 18th birthday, advocating for a more balanced doctor-patient relationship and urging for its adoption across the entire UK, including in maternity services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, after no tickets successfully matched all winning numbers in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This monumental sum now ranks as the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, offering an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. The current run of 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner has tied the game's record, with Saturday's drawing poised to be the 42nd. A single winner could opt for either an annuity, paid over 29 years with increasing annual payments, or a substantial lump sum. The elusive odds of claiming the top prize stand at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Over a thousand dedicated Welsh football fans have undertaken an extraordinary 7,000-mile round trip to Astana, Kazakhstan, for a World Cup qualifier, making it the furthest the men's national team has ever traveled for such a match. Dubbed "Wales Away" veterans, supporters have embraced the unique cultural experience, including horseback riding and sampling local cuisine, even if "horse four ways" proved unappetizing for some. The fans' adventurous spirit and warm reception from locals highlight the Red Wall's loyal and respectful following. This arduous journey underscores their commitment, contrasting with the players' focus solely on securing a crucial victory for their World Cup qualification hopes.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that the Chinese public holds nuanced and flexible perspectives on US rivalry and China's role in global leadership, suggesting avenues for reducing US-China tensions. Conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre, the survey indicates that nearly half of respondents envision China in a "shared leadership role," implying a desire for peaceful coexistence with the United States and the West. Despite widespread optimism about their nation's future, economy, military, and culture, the findings suggest a curiosity and skepticism among the Chinese regarding American interest in them. Authors caution that self-censorship may have influenced some responses.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has reversed the Trump administration's decision to cut billions in research funding to Harvard University, ruling that the government violated the Ivy League college's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that while Harvard should have done more to address antisemitism, the administration's "true aim" was not to combat it, but rather to launch an "ideologically-motivated assault" on premier universities. The ruling blocks further funding stoppages and ensures payment on existing grants, marking a significant legal victory for Harvard. The White House, however, has vowed to appeal the decision, criticizing the judge as an "activist."</p>

This effort comes as Southeast Asia increasingly accepts Chinese aircraft deliveries, despite the market dominance of Airbus and Boeing. The workshop, organized by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, covers essential topics like safety management, airworthiness certification, and green development. Experts view this as a strategic move by China's Comac to "break the duopoly" of Western giants and enhance its influence in the regional aviation sector, fostering deeper China-Southeast Asia economic cooperation.</p>

New Hampshire presents a challenging landscape for GOP Senate candidates, with no Republican winning a Senate race there since 2010.
