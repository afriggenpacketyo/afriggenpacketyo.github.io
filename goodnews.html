          <p>The LA Galaxy secured their first victory of the 2025 MLS season, defeating Real Salt Lake 2-0 at Dignity Health Sports Park, with goals from Lucas Sanabria and Joseph Paintsil. This win marks a significant relief for the defending league champions, who had endured a 16-game winless streak, the worst start to a season in MLS history. Coach Greg Vanney expressed pride in his team's resilience, noting that they had maintained their commitment throughout the challenging season. Although this victory offers a respite, it may be a temporary reprieve, as Real Salt Lake has also been struggling, having gone six games without a win.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard successfully rescued two individuals after a small Piper PA-32 aircraft crashed into Long Island Sound near Branford, Connecticut. The plane, which had declared an emergency while communicating with New York Air Traffic Control, was en route from Bridgeport's Sikorsky Memorial Airport before being redirected to Tweed New Haven Airport. Airport personnel activated emergency protocols, but the plane went down in the water. The rescued occupants were taken to Stony Creek Pier for medical support and then transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, prompting relief and gratitude from airport officials.</p>

Rushdie, who has a new book coming out, mentioned that he and his wife returned to the site of the attack to show himself that he could stand up where he fell down. He expressed a desire to discuss fiction again, as most conversations since the attack have focused solely on the incident. Despite suffering life-changing injuries, including blindness in one eye and a paralyzed hand, Rushdie affirmed that he is in better shape than expected and remains optimistic about the future.</p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly focusing on short-term bonds, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns and volatility in the market. The 3-month T-Bill is yielding above 4.3% annually, attracting investors to ultrashort opportunities, as evidenced by significant inflows into ETFs like iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL). Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries. Experts suggest that long-duration investments are currently less appealing, prompting a shift towards shorter-end maturities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump withdrew his nomination of Jared Isaacman for a NASA position due to donations he had made to Democrats, but sources indicate that Trump was aware of these contributions prior to the nomination. Isaacman, an ally of Elon Musk, had disclosed his political donations, suggesting the withdrawal was not due to newly discovered information. The situation highlights the complexities of political appointments and the scrutiny nominees face regarding their past affiliations and contributions. This event underscores the potential for pre-existing knowledge to influence decision-making processes in government appointments.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 led England to a three-wicket victory over the West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series with a game to spare. Root became England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, surpassing Eoin Morgan's tally, as he guided England to their target of 309. Despite a shaky start at 93-4, Root's partnerships with Harry Brook and Will Jacks propelled England to victory. Earlier, Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total of 308, but sloppy fielding from England allowed the visitors to capitalize.</p>
