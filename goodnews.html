          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coastline. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, with the Treasury hailing it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment's necessity for achieving a 'golden age of clean energy'. However, critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue that the government has not been transparent about the plant's total cost and that the funds could be better allocated elsewhere.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have seen a significant decline, particularly among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in overdose risk. Data from the CDC shows that drug deaths among those under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, researchers caution that sustaining this progress may be difficult, especially for those struggling with severe addiction.</p>
