          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round, marking the largest private fusion investment in Europe to date. Investors are optimistic about the company's potential to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, is seen as a pivotal technology for the energy transition, potentially providing virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy. While some researchers remain skeptical about the timeline for commercial scalability, Proxima Fusion aims to bring the first European fusion power plant online within the next decade. The company believes it is well-positioned to leverage momentum in the fusion energy sector and shift global energy dependence from natural resources to technological leadership.</p>

          <p>A court ruling ordering the Tokyo government and the state to compensate Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and others for an unlawful investigation has been finalized. The case involved a suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment, specifically spray-drying apparatus that investigators believed could be used in biological weapons production. Okawara and two other men will receive approximately 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages after their arrests and indictments were recognized as illegal. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation, prompted by a petition with over 40,000 signatures and concerns raised by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry regarding the legal interpretation of export control rules.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has indicated that the current share price of Commerzbank is too high for a potential takeover bid to be viable. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank through derivatives and has the ECB's authorization to increase its holding to 29.9%. Orcel stated that an acquisition offer at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value would not be in the best interest of UniCredit's investors. He emphasized that UniCredit is not currently pursuing a merger bid and would seek a "constructive solution" to address opposition from the German government before considering such a move.</p>

          <p>Asia is progressively reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committing to increasing the use of local currencies in trade and investment. The move is driven by concerns over the dollar's potential weaponization in trade negotiations and sanctions, leading countries to re-evaluate their U.S. dollar portfolios. This de-dollarization trend is also evident in central bank reserves and trade transactions, as Asian economies seek to mitigate foreign exchange risks by using their own currencies. Investors are increasingly hedging their U.S. dollar exposures, further fueling demand for local and alternative currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

The skeletons, dating back to 1862, were found with their arms crossed and buried in comfortable clothes rather than uniforms. Historians believe a makeshift hospital operated nearby, treating wounded Confederate soldiers. Researchers are working to identify the soldiers, with the bodies reinterred at a local burial ground.
