          <p>Stock markets across Asia saw significant gains, with mainland China's CSI 300 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index leading the surge. The rally was largely driven by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which signaled that the central bank might begin easing its monetary policy soon. Analysts suggest that momentum could be sustained by capital rotating from the U.S. to China and from maturing time deposits into equities. Chinese property and technology stocks were among the top performers following the news. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative aims to slow the expansion of the Gobi Desert, a major source of the sand and dust storms that increasingly affect the wider East Asian region. With nearly 80% of Mongolian land impacted by degradation, this cross-border collaboration is crucial for mitigating the severe environmental and health challenges posed by desertification.

This rally follows the launch of its new ES8 SUV, which is priced more affordably under a battery subscription plan designed to lower the initial purchase cost. The move is seen as a strategic effort by Nio to capture a broader customer base amid intense competition in China's EV market. The company has also recently launched two other cheaper brands to target different market segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation for July cooled to 0.6%, a rate lower than economists had forecast and the lowest level recorded since January 2021. The dip was attributed to falling prices for retail goods, electricity, and gas. This easing inflation has increased speculation that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) might loosen its monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting. The central bank anticipates that inflation will remain moderate due to slowing global demand and modest domestic cost pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists are observing a significant shift in labor market dynamics, from the "Great Resignation" to a new phase dubbed the "Great Stay."

This has created what some call a "no-hire, no-fire" market, characterized by very low turnover. This trend of stabilization, driven by worker insecurity and employer caution, is evident in recent data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
