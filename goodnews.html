        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anduril has topped the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for 2025, signaling a significant increase in interest and investment in the defense technology sector. This marks the first time in the list's 13-year history that a defense tech company has secured the top spot, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also making the list. These four companies collectively boast a valuation exceeding $45 billion and have attracted nearly $10 billion in investor funding, demonstrating the sector's rapid growth and diverse geographic presence outside of Silicon Valley. The growth is expected to accelerate with President Trump's proposed increase in defense spending, with a focus on modernizing military capabilities and opening opportunities beyond the legacy defense sector. Optimism is fueled by the sector's increasing focus on dual-use technologies and the explosion in generative AI's capabilities. </p>

          <p>Nintendo has launched the Switch 2, its first new console in eight years, building upon the success of the original Switch, which sold 15 million units in its first year. The Switch 2 boasts a larger screen, improved performance, and a higher price tag of $450, but still sold out within minutes of pre-orders opening. Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser says the new console enhances gameplay with powerful new features. Analysts predict Nintendo will sell 15 million units in the first year, despite potential initial supply constraints. </p>

          <p>Uber is partnering with Wayve, an AI firm, to pilot fully driverless rides in the UK, with trials beginning in spring 2026. This pilot program will allow users to take Uber rides without a safety driver, reaching Level 4 autonomy. The move follows the increasing popularity of self-driving vehicles in San Francisco, where Waymo, Google's autonomous driving venture, already offers commercial ride-hailing services. Uber's COO Andrew MacDonald said the partnership brings the company closer to making autonomy a safe and reliable option for riders everywhere. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hummingbird feeders, intended to aid these tiny birds, can become deadly traps if not properly cleaned and maintained. Spoilage of sugar water in feeders leads to microbial growth, causing infections like candida in hummingbirds, which can lead to tongue swelling and starvation. Wildlife rehabbers report frequently rescuing hummingbirds with feeder-related infections. The solution involves using the correct sugar-to-water ratio (1:4) and cleaning feeders every one to three days, with more frequent cleaning in hot weather, to prevent harmful microbial growth. </p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to partially reverse cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners in England and Wales with annual incomes of ¬£35,000 or less. Miliband stated that Reeves had to initially make cuts to stabilize the economy, but the improved financial situation allowed for the partial reversal. The Conservative shadow chancellor criticized the government for leaving pensioners in the cold last winter. Critics argue that the change creates complexity and administrative costs. </p>

          <p>Gen Z is showing signs of increased religious engagement, reversing previous trends of declining religiosity among younger generations. Experts are exploring potential reasons for this shift, including rebellion against atheist parents and the appeal of traditional religious structures. Catholicism is seeing a rise in young men. This trend suggests a complex interplay of social, political, and personal factors influencing Gen Z's spiritual journeys. </p>
