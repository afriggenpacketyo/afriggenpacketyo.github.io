          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the company behind cereals like Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies, skyrocketed by over 50% following reports that it is in advanced acquisition talks with Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The potential deal, valued at approximately $3 billion, could be finalized as soon as this week and would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. This move comes as WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles and significant debt, having been split from its former parent company, Kellanova, in 2023. The breakfast cereal industry faces challenges from shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options and rising operational costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent government measures designed to cool down Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% year-over-year in June, prompting authorities to address the rapid expansion of household debt. Despite a slight economic contraction in the first quarter, the central bank prioritized financial stability over immediate growth stimulation. Analysts suggest that the bank may consider rate cuts later in the year, likely in August and November, once the new mortgage lending restrictions have had a discernible impact on the property market and household borrowing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, successfully rehabilitated after being poisoned by a toxic algal bloom, were released back into the wild in Huntington Beach. This year's bloom was the most severe in Southern California since 2015, sickening hundreds of seabirds and other marine animals like sea lions with domoic acid. The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center treated the pelicans and nearly 200 other seabirds during the crisis. The public release event, attended by community members and junior lifeguards, served as a hopeful symbol of the positive impact of wildlife rescue efforts, though two of the birds had to be returned for further care after failing to take flight.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA, filling the leadership vacuum at a critical time for the space agency. This appointment follows the recent withdrawal of billionaire Jared Isaacman's nomination, a move Trump later explained was due to Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his close professional ties to Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX is a major NASA contractor. Duffy, who will now serve in a dual-hatted role, takes charge as NASA advances its ambitious plans to return astronauts to the Moon and pursue human exploration of Mars. The agency had been led by an acting administrator since the start of Trump's term.</p>

          <p>A tentative contract agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that had disrupted city services. The strike, involving 9,000 workers including sanitation staff and 911 dispatchers, led to trash piling up across the city. The new three-year contract reportedly includes a 3% raise in each year and a one-time $1,500 bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm during negotiations, insisting on a fiscally responsible deal. Workers began returning to their jobs immediately, with trash collection resuming ahead of the union members' ratification vote.</p>
