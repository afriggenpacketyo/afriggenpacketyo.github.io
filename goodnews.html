          <p>Phil McNulty's end-of-season Premier League review highlights Liverpool's dominant victory, exceeding pre-season expectations to secure their 20th title.

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, initiatives focusing on police officer mental health are gaining momentum.  The killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests highlighted the already poor mental health of officers, leading to increased attention and action.

          <p>This article advocates for a new Memorial Day to honor civilian victims of war, highlighting the disproportionate number of civilian deaths compared to military casualties throughout history.  The author points to the vast number of civilian deaths in conflicts like World War II, the post-9/11 wars, and the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan.  The current Memorial Day, focused primarily on military personnel, overlooks the immense suffering of civilians caught in the crossfire.  The proposal aims to provide equal recognition to the victims of war, regardless of their military status.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Robert Macfarlane's book, "Is a River Alive?" which challenges the traditional separation between animate and inanimate nature, particularly relevant in the context of climate change.  Macfarlane's work highlights the experiences of people living on the front lines of environmental disasters, where the aliveness of nature is undeniable.  The article also discusses the Rights of Nature movement, which seeks to grant legal rights to natural entities.  The author emphasizes the importance of time, attention, and a shift in language to recognize the inherent aliveness of the natural world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the resilience of American democracy in the face of Donald Trump's actions during his second term.  Despite concerns about democratic erosion, the author identifies six key features that contribute to America's resilience: advocacy groups, an independent judiciary, a difficult-to-change constitutional system, a free press, federalism, and strong free speech protections.  These features, while potentially having trade-offs in normal times, offer significant advantages when democracy is under threat. The author concludes that while threats are real, America's democratic institutions are better positioned than many foreign counterparts facing similar challenges.</p>
