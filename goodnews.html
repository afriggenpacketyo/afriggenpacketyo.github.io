          <p>Daniel Levy is ending his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, a move understood to have been decided by the club's ownership. Despite overseeing significant infrastructural growth, including a new £1 billion stadium, and achieving a recent Europa League victory, his leadership was often criticized by fans for a lack of consistent on-field success. The club's ownership reportedly believes a change in leadership is necessary to achieve greater sporting success. Peter Charrington will assume the new role of non-executive chairman as the club enters a new era.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order centered on "true multilateralism" is resonating with developing nations, particularly in the Muslim world. As the era of uncontested U.S. global primacy wanes, many countries in the Global South feel disillusioned with Western-led institutions, citing unresolved issues like debt dependency and vaccine inequality. Beijing's vision offers an alternative framework that promises greater inclusivity and appeals to nations seeking to diversify their political and economic alliances away from Washington. The piece suggests this represents a significant paradigm shift in international relations.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving subsidiary, Waymo, announced it will begin testing its driverless robotaxi service at San Jose Mineta International Airport this fall. This marks the company's first expansion into a California airport, with plans to offer paid rides to the public later in the year. The service will connect the airport's terminals to Waymo's existing service area in the San Francisco Bay Area. This move follows the successful launch of a similar service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become a popular destination for the company's autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Gradual Decline in Mortgage Rates Through 2025 with Potential for Further Drops</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 17:27:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a downward trend throughout 2025, providing some relief for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For example, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen by more than half a percentage point since the beginning of the year. This decline is attributed to shifts in the broader economy and Federal Reserve policy, with further small rate cuts anticipated. While rates are not as low as they were at the start of the decade, the consistent downward trajectory offers a reason for cautious optimism in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Broadcom reported strong fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by a significant increase in its artificial intelligence-related business. The company's AI revenue jumped 63% to $5.2 billion, thanks to high demand for its custom AI accelerators and networking components used by major cloud companies. Overall, the chipmaker's revenue grew 22% year-over-year, and it provided an optimistic forecast for the upcoming quarter. The strong performance reflects the ongoing boom in AI infrastructure and Broadcom's key role in supplying critical hardware for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ESPN analyst and former NFL player Ryan Clark caused a stir by stating that legendary quarterbacks Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Peyton Manning were not "generational talents." During a discussion on "First Take," Clark argued that players like John Elway and Patrick Mahomes fit the description, but not the aforementioned trio, who are the top three all-time in passing yards and touchdowns. The New Orleans Saints' official social media account quickly responded by posting screenshots of the NFL's all-time passing records, highlighting the statistical dominance of Brees, Brady, and Manning in a pointed rebuttal to Clark's controversial opinion.</p>

          <p>A new fiscal package signed into law by President Trump includes a temporary provision that exempts tips from federal income tax for workers in 68 specified occupations. The Treasury Department has released a preliminary list of eligible jobs, which includes traditional tipped roles like bartenders and waitstaff, as well as some less conventional ones such as plumbers and electricians. To qualify, workers must earn less than $150,000 annually and can claim a maximum of $25,000 in tax-free tipped income per year. This tax break is currently scheduled to be in effect through the 2028 tax year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial rule of thumb known as the "$1,000 a month rule" helps individuals calculate how much they need to save to generate a specific monthly income in retirement. Based on the widely used 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that a person needs between $240,000 and $300,000 saved to safely generate $1,000 per month without depleting their principal over a 30-year period. This guideline transforms abstract retirement goals into concrete savings targets, making it easier for people to plan. For example, to generate $4,000 monthly, one would need a nest egg of approximately $960,000 to $1.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from New Hampshire, Jackson Denio, caught a massive 177-pound Atlantic halibut during an overnight deep-sea fishing trip in the Gulf of Maine. The fish outweighed the teenager by nearly 60 pounds and required a 30-minute struggle to reel in. Denio was fishing about 100 miles off the coast on Cashes Ledge, a location known for its rich marine biodiversity. The captain of the charter boat praised the teen's composure and determination, noting that he never let anyone else touch the rod during the intense fight to land the potentially record-breaking fish.</p>
