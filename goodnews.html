          <h2>Another 'China Shock' Could Bring Lower Inflation Globally</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a flood of low-cost exports, sparking concerns in Asia about squeezing local industries. However, economists suggest this "China shock" could also bring a silver lining: lower inflation for consumers worldwide. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., the country's production overdrive is rippling through global markets, potentially easing the cost-of-living crisis in some economies. This influx of affordable goods may also provide central banks with some relief as they balance lowering living costs with reviving economic growth.

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth, with his work reflecting a life spent between diverse worlds. After escaping Nazi Germany in the 1930s, Mann became a voice for democracy, writing political essays and delivering radio speeches against the German regime. His early works, such as "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," brought him global fame, while later works reflected his opposition to authoritarianism. Despite facing challenges and criticism, Mann remained steadfast in his commitment to democracy and left a lasting legacy through his literature and actions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank has surprised markets by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. While the RBI acknowledged growth concerns amid global uncertainties and tariffs, it also revised its inflation outlook downward. Given the significant rate cut, the RBI is shifting its monetary policy stance to neutral, signaling limited room for further easing. The optimism score is not mentioned in this summary.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's proclamation that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. The judge stated that Harvard had demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. This is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, who make up a significant portion of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge, calling the ban illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The optimism score is not mentioned in this summary.</p>

          <p>Despite fears that AI could automate jobs and cut wages, a new PwC report suggests that AI actually makes people "more valuable, not less." The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, challenging six common myths about AI's impact. It found that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, and productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI. The report suggests that AI can enrich jobs, create broader opportunities, and even be helpful in countries with declining working-age populations.
