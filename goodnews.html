          <p>Shares of Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group experienced a massive surge during their market debut in Hong Kong, trading at nearly four times their initial public offering price. This strong performance reflects robust investor confidence in China's pharmaceutical sector, which has seen rising valuations and successful IPOs from other biotech firms recently. Innogen's offering was particularly popular among retail investors, raising approximately $87.2 million and capitalizing on favorable market conditions for pre-revenue biotech companies under the exchange's specific listing rules. The success is part of a broader trend, with major biotech companies in Hong Kong gaining an average of 137 percent this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's economy demonstrated resilience by expanding 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, outperforming economists' forecasts despite trade pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in net exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, also beating expectations and leading to a rise in the Nikkei 225 index. However, the Bank of Japan remains cautious, warning that global trade policies could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and affect domestic corporate profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump shrugged off concerns about Latin American countries, such as Brazil, increasing their economic coordination with China in response to U.S. tariffs. At the White House, Trump asserted that the U.S. economy is outperforming all other countries, including China, stating, "we’re blowing everyone away." His comments came as Brazil is working with Beijing to develop a multilateral response to a 50 percent tariff Washington imposed on a range of Brazilian exports. The tariffs, announced in late July, have threatened billions of dollars in trade and pushed affected nations to seek alternative economic partnerships.</p>

The song's release coincides with the announcement of his Sendé World Tour, which will include stops in five major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This tour marks a significant step for the 31-year-old singer, who began his career busking on the streets of Medellín.

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are initiating a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts to counteract a Republican effort in Texas to create more GOP-favorable seats. The move, described as meeting "fire with fire," aims to create up to five new Democratic-leaning districts in California if Texas proceeds with its plan. However, the process in California is more complex, likely requiring a constitutional amendment approved by a two-thirds legislative vote and then by voters in a special election. Newsom framed the action as a transparent and temporary response to what he called President Trump's attempt to "rig the system."</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decline after the collapse of its steel industry, is experiencing a quiet economic and social revival. Entrepreneurs are transforming abandoned factories and mills into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market, bringing new life to the city's historic structures. This revitalization effort has helped stabilize the population and bring the local unemployment rate closer to the national average. Local business owners champion the city's resilience, embodying the slogan, "Tough times don't last. Tough cities do," as they forge a new identity for Youngstown beyond its steel-producing past.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to educate the public about the potential dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic procedures. This initiative is a response to a growing trend of Britons seeking cheaper treatments like hair implants and dental work overseas, which sometimes result in life-altering injuries and require the NHS to fix botched surgeries. The campaign will feature content creators providing guidance, such as advising people to consult a UK doctor first and to avoid package deals that include procedures. The goal is to help individuals make safer, more informed decisions before undergoing cosmetic surgery abroad.</p>

          <p>Four years after making a groundbreaking shift to an entirely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park will begin serving animal products again. Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative imperative, cited a desire for inclusion and business realities as reasons for the reversal. He noted that the all-vegan concept was excluding some diners, particularly for corporate events, and that wine sales had declined. While the restaurant will continue to offer a plant-based menu, it will now also feature select dishes with fish, meat, and other animal products to broaden its appeal.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama joined a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats to praise their efforts in blocking a Republican-led redistricting plan. By leaving the state to deny a legislative quorum, the Texas Democrats have temporarily halted a GOP proposal to redraw congressional maps in their favor. Obama told the legislators that their courage has prompted a response from other states like California and has helped lead a long struggle to protect democracy. The meeting, which also included former Attorney General Eric Holder, signals high-level support within the Democratic party for the Texas lawmakers' controversial but impactful actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Trump and President Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, their primary objectives for the summit appear to be distinct. For Putin, the meeting itself signifies a diplomatic victory, demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate Russia have failed and re-establishing the country at the top table of global politics. For Trump, the summit represents an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of acting as a global peacemaker by brokering an end to the war in Ukraine. While Putin seeks territorial concessions and a direct line with the U.S., Trump is focused on securing a deal, though his approach has been described as vacillating and unpredictable.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history as the oldest player to compete in the U.S. Open singles tournament since 1981. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and two-time U.S. Open winner, received a wild card invitation to participate in her 25th singles championship at the event. Her return follows a series of injuries but comes after a recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004. Her participation highlights the remarkable longevity seen in professional tennis, where many athletes continue to compete at the highest level well into their 30s and 40s.</p>

          <p>Three of Dame Vera Lynn's first audition records, made 90 years ago, are set to be released for the first time. The silver aluminum discs were discovered by her daughter after she donated the late singer's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. The tracks, including "What A Difference A Day Makes," will be released by Decca to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, with more previously unheard material to follow on a new album. The release offers a rare glimpse into the early career of the beloved "Forces' Sweetheart," who became a symbol of hope for Britain during the Second World War.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven technology developed by the company Flawless is changing how foreign language films are dubbed, potentially breaking down barriers for international cinema in markets like the U.S. The tool, called DeepEditor, manipulates an actor's lip movements in the video to perfectly sync with the dubbed audio, creating a seamless viewing experience. The technology was recently used on a Swedish sci-fi film, enabling a theatrical release in over 100 U.S. cinemas that would have otherwise been impossible. This innovation could significantly expand the reach of non-English films by overcoming audience aversion to traditional dubbing and subtitles.</p>
