          <p>A new S&P report indicates that China's exports to the Global South have surged, doubling since 2015 and accelerating significantly after the U.S.-China trade war. This shift, motivated by U.S. tariffs and China's domestic slowdown, has resulted in China's exports to developing nations now exceeding its combined exports to the U.S. and Western Europe by over 50%. The trend suggests a potential reordering of global commerce, with South-South trade gaining prominence and Chinese multinational corporations becoming key players in this new economic landscape.

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump announced he has contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin to arrange a direct meeting between the two warring leaders. Trump stated that a trilateral meeting including himself would follow. While Zelenskyy confirmed readiness for such talks, the Kremlin's official statement was more reserved, mentioning only an agreement to continue direct negotiations and potentially raise the level of representatives. The development comes after previous attempts to orchestrate a high-level meeting failed.</p>

          <p>Discussions in Washington between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, joined by European leaders, have yielded several key developments, including a potential face-to-face meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. Trump has also signaled a willingness to provide U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, a significant step, though he appeared to back away from Ukraine's demand for a ceasefire before negotiations. The meeting also saw a concerted effort from Zelenskyy and European leaders to present a united and appreciative front, a notable shift from a previous acrimonious White House visit.</p>

As the latest variant in the Type 99 series, which entered service in 2001, the 55-tonne vehicle features an improved 125mm smoothbore main gun and a larger turret. The continued prominence of such land-based systems highlights their strategic importance, a lesson reinforced by recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, even as China heavily invests in its navy and air force.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed concerns about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence investment, stating that valuations have become "insane" and some investors will likely get "very burnt." Despite this, he affirmed his belief in AI's long-term value and OpenAI's plans for massive spending on infrastructure. In contrast, some market analysts downplay comparisons to the dot-com bubble, arguing that today's leading AI companies are funding growth with strong cash flow and solid earnings, unlike the over-leveraged companies of that era.

          <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is making a $2 billion investment in Intel, purchasing shares at $23 each, which caused the chipmaker's stock to rise in extended trading. This move makes SoftBank one of Intel's largest shareholders and is seen as a vote of confidence in the company, which has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom. The investment comes as Intel's foundry business seeks major customers and the U.S. government reportedly considers taking its own equity stake in the strategically important American company.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy demonstrated a markedly different approach during his recent White House meeting, contrasting with a contentious visit in February. Heeding advice from European allies, Zelenskyy adopted a more gracious tone, repeatedly thanking President Trump and avoiding confrontation, which appeared to de-escalate tensions. This strategic shift in demeanor and dress was part of a broader effort by Zelenskyy and European leaders to manage Trump's unpredictable style and keep the focus on securing a ceasefire and future security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tesla has started taking orders for its new Model Y L in China, with a starting price of approximately $47,200.

The original Model Y, launched in 2020, was the world's best-selling car in 2023 but has seen its sales momentum slow, prompting this update to maintain its market position.</p>

Alibaba claims its model's strong performance is due to high-quality, code-heavy training data and reinforcement learning. The success of Qwen 3 Coder highlights the intensifying competition in the AI-assisted coding sector, with numerous Chinese tech firms launching their own tools.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western conferences. He argued that such a change would reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason and broadcast schedules, particularly for West Coast audiences. While the idea faces potential pushback from traditionalists, it reflects the league's strategic thinking as it considers adding new teams in cities like Nashville and Salt Lake City.</p>

          <p>An international research team has collected long tubes of sediment from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of the Southern Ocean's history. By analyzing the distinct layers of mud, scientists can reconstruct past marine life, measure pollution levels, and calculate how much carbon is stored on the seafloor. A key goal is to use environmental DNA analysis to understand the impact of industrial whaling, which removed vast numbers of whales, and to quantify how these large animals contribute to carbon sequestration when they die and sink.</p>

This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's center, which is at risk from ground fissures.

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency ban on the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax," making its sale and possession illegal in the state.

The unregulated drug, which has been linked to dozens of overdose deaths in Kentucky, poses a growing public health threat nationwide.</p>
