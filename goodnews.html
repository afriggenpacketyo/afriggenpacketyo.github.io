The band recently received the Ivor Novello Awards, becoming the first Irish group to be given fellowship of the Ivors' songwriting academy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass‚Äô public safety initiatives due to a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall. The budget cuts funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than any point since 1995, and reduces the number of new hires for the Los Angeles Fire Department. The council aimed to spare 1,000 city workers from layoffs, but the budget still faces criticism for potentially making the city less safe. The council did restore positions at the Department of Cultural Affairs, averting the closure of the historic Hollyhock House in East Hollywood, protecting its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
