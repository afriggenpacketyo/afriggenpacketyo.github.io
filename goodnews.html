          <p>Musician John Fogerty, at 80 years old, has released a new album featuring re-recordings of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs, a project undertaken after he regained the rights to his music catalog. For decades, Fogerty had lost control over his own compositions following the band's breakup, a painful experience that led him to stop performing his classic hits for a period. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he embarked on the new album, "Legacy," which features his sons Shane and Tyler in his band. Fogerty reflects on the emotional journey of revisiting the songs and the pride he feels in finally owning his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates designed to operate jointly in northern Europe. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the UK's defense industry over its competitors.</p>

          <p>During a college football game between the New Mexico Lobos and the Michigan Wolverines, a notable moment occurred when a New Mexico lineman chose to de-escalate a potential conflict. After a play in the third quarter, some pushing and shoving began, and Michigan linebacker Ernest Hausmann appeared to confront Lobos guard Richard Pearce. Rather than engaging further, Pearce was seen on replay running away from the developing scuffle as officials intervened to separate the players. The game concluded with Michigan securing a decisive 34-17 victory over New Mexico in their opening-week matchup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary piece, comedian Jim Gaffigan reflects on the perils of being an overly ambitious but unskilled home gardener, particularly concerning his cucumber plants. He describes his annual cycle of May optimism, where he plans to "do it right this year," followed by the August realization that his efforts have produced an unmanageable surplus of cucumbers. Gaffigan jokes about his use of "succession planting," which, instead of providing a steady supply, has resulted in a deluge of produce. The commentary details his family's attempts to consume the bounty before he ultimately resorts to begging others to take his cucumbers.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta investigates the complexities of chronic pain, revealing that its source often lies within the brain itself. The article highlights the story of a musician who suffered from a debilitating condition until a revolutionary clinical trial mapped his pain signals directly in his brain. This groundbreaking research allowed doctors to predict and interrupt pain signals with targeted deep brain stimulation before he could even consciously feel them. Dr. Gupta explains that this approach demonstrates that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering hope for millions who suffer from chronic conditions.</p>

          <p>A tribute from CBS News' Susan Zirinsky honors the life and career of legendary White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who passed away recently. Knoller was revered as the unofficial records keeper of the presidency, meticulously logging every presidential action, trip, and comment for over three decades. His detailed statistics were so reliable that even the White House would consult him for information. Colleagues remembered him not only for his unparalleled work ethic and distinctive radio voice but also for his generosity, warmth, and intuitive editorial sense. Knoller's dedication to factual record-keeping made him an institution in Washington journalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A slow-moving cold front is expected to bring significant rainfall and a risk of flooding to Central Florida throughout the upcoming week. Forecasters predict that rain chances will be elevated, peaking on Tuesday or Wednesday, with some areas potentially receiving five to six inches of rain over several days. The primary threat associated with the weather system is isolated flooding, with Volusia, Flagler, and Lake counties identified as areas of particular concern. The increased cloud cover and precipitation will also keep temperatures slightly below normal for this time of year, with daily highs expected in the upper 80s.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building genuine, long-term cooperation with children relies on making them feel emotionally safe and connected. The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and encourage them to listen without resorting to power struggles. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" defuse shame and empower children as problem-solvers. The expert emphasizes that these techniques are most effective within a broader parenting approach that consistently protects a child's dignity and follows through on boundaries, making listening a natural outcome.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal writer makes the case for hunting as a morally complex but honest and sustainable way to consume meat, challenging the reflexive disdain for the practice often found on the left. The author recounts her own journey to hunting, emphasizing the deep connection to nature and the responsibility one feels when taking an animal's life. The article argues that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, funding wildlife management through licenses and taxes on firearms. It posits that hunting, when done ethically, is more sustainable than consuming factory-farmed or globally shipped vegan products, fostering a direct link between life, death, and sustenance.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This makes the current prize the fifth-largest in the game's history, attracting widespread participation despite the astronomical odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million. The last time the jackpot was won was on May 31, allowing the prize to accumulate over several months. A potential winner could choose to receive the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or opt for an immediate lump sum of approximately $498.4 million before taxes.

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is highlighting the little-known story of how surfing was first introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885. The sport was brought to the shores of Santa Cruz by three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were attending a nearby military school. Using boards fashioned from local redwood to replicate the ones they used at home, the princes demonstrated what was then called "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. Their display of the traditional royal sport of Hawaii planted the seed for a culture that would eventually sweep across the nation.</p>

His focus is on selling OpenAI's powerful AI models directly to large corporations like Moderna and Morgan Stanley, a move that creates both partnership and competition with key investor Microsoft.

          <p>As part of a broader effort to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia is banning single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The iconic plastic fish, a staple in many takeaway restaurants, will be prohibited from sale or distribution starting Monday. Officials stated that while the containers are used for mere seconds, they can persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process effectively. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted other single-use plastics like straws and carrier bags to protect marine life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open's signature cocktail, the Honey Deuce, is now priced at $23, a cost that has risen faster than the general rate of inflation over the last decade. Since 2015, the price of the popular vodka-based drink has increased by approximately 53%, while the consumer price index has risen by about 36% during the same period. If the cocktail's price had tracked inflation, it would cost just over $20 today. Despite the steep price, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue and proving its popularity among tennis fans attending the New York City championship.
