          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to survive the Venusian atmosphere, is likely to remain partially intact upon impact. While the event poses minimal risk of injury on the ground, recovered pieces would legally belong to Russia, as the registered owner of the object.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not run for Senate in 2026, citing the Senate's ineffectiveness and obstructionism. Greene criticized fellow Republicans, consultants, and donors for failing to deliver on campaign promises and obstructing the will of the people. She claimed beating incumbent Senator Jon Ossoff would be easy but argued that the Senate is designed to protect the Uniparty's grip on power. Greene stated she will continue to serve the American people fearlessly from her current position in the House of Representatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signaled potential flexibility on tariffs with China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of high-level trade talks in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators, marking the first publicly announced meeting since the trade war began. Investors are hopeful for a reduction below 80%, with some analysts suggesting tariffs could be cut to 50%-60% following the negotiations. The U.S. and China have been engaged in a tense trade standoff since Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from China.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, effective through Oct. 31, warns against eating mussels harvested along the West Coast due to the potential for paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. These toxins can accumulate in mussels during algae blooms, making them poisonous to humans, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the risk. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine, as they undergo frequent testing.</p>
