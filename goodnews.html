          <p>Despite recent military strikes by India within Pakistani territory, Indian markets have shown remarkable resilience, driven by strong domestic demand, structural reforms, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals. Investors remain optimistic about India's growth prospects, viewing any market dips as momentary pauses rather than derailments. The progress in India's trade talks, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., further bolsters market confidence. The country is expected to be among the first in the region to strike a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. before the third quarter of 2025, further strengthening India's economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, anticipating the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant had previously reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales for Wegovy, leading to a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast. However, the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA is expected to allow sales to pick up again later in the year. CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen expects compounding to be knocked off, so to say, and we get that business growth going forward.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander is set to return to the stage after a 17-year hiatus, making her UK theatre debut in a West End production of Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea.' Vikander, who grew up around theatre due to her mother's stage acting career, will play the lead character Ellida, a sea-loving woman torn between her current marriage and a former lover's return. The play, adapted and directed by Simon Stone, will run for eight weeks at London's Bridge Theatre, also starring Andrew Lincoln.

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade concerns. The measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with initiatives for consumption and elderly care. However, some analysts suggest that borrowing may be insensitive to interest rates, limiting the measures' impact on domestic credit demand. These broad stimulus announcements showed the officials were acting with greater urgency to bolster the economy and the easing depreciation pressure on Chinese yuan has created more desirable condition.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), was elected chancellor in a second round of voting on Tuesday, after an unprecedented first round where he failed to secure enough votes. A total of 325 lawmakers voted in favor of Merz the second time around, bringing him over the necessary 316 threshold required to be chancellor in the 630-seat parliament. The first round of voting stunned the country because it had never happened before in the country's postwar history and sent social media into a frenzy. Merz becomes Germany's tenth postwar chancellor and the CDU's sixth holder of the post.</p>

While the U.S. explores potential trade agreements with Canada and China, other nations are advancing bilateral deals. The U.K. and India have agreed on a trade agreement to remove tariffs on most items within a decade, and ASEAN and China are set to negotiate improvements to their free-trade agreement.
