          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese aviation authorities have banned air passengers from carrying portable power banks that do not meet the mandatory "3C" safety certification. This emergency measure follows several incidents where defective units caught fire on commercial flights, raising significant public safety concerns. The ban has caused confusion among travelers and led to large numbers of abandoned devices at airports, while regulators are expected to conclude a review of power bank products by the end of July. This action is part of a broader trend in Asia to tighten regulations on lithium-ion batteries during air travel.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to hire Varun Mohan, the CEO and co-founder of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This arrangement involves licensing fees and compensation, but it is not an acquisition, allowing Windsurf to continue operating and license its technology to others. The move highlights the escalating "talent war" in the artificial intelligence sector, with major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft aggressively recruiting top personnel from promising startups. This follows similar talent-focused deals, such as Microsoft's with Inflection AI.</p>

          <p>China is poised to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with approximately 60 domestically developed medications currently in clinical trials. These drugs aim to compete with popular GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic, whose patent for its active ingredient is set to expire in China in 2026. This development is expected to significantly increase the availability and affordability of treatments for obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that the entry of numerous generic manufacturers will drive down prices in a market estimated to be worth over $150 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a Chicago federal court to running a significant part of the Sinaloa Cartel. He admitted to coordinating large-scale drug trafficking operations, including fentanyl, and using violence to protect the cartel's activities. As part of a plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will forfeit $80 million and cooperate with authorities, marking a major success for U.S. law enforcement's "Operation Take Back America." U.S. officials hailed the plea as a significant step in dismantling the cartel's leadership.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, signaling confidence despite a recent slowdown in activity attributed to global trade tensions and rising tariffs. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will add 19 acres of new land and extend the quay to accommodate larger cargo ships. Officials state this will boost the port's cargo-handling capacity by 50% and strengthen the American supply chain. This forward-looking investment proceeds even as both the Port of Long Beach and the nearby Port of Los Angeles report recent drops in container movement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops based on factors like race, language, or location in Southern California. U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled that there was sufficient evidence that agents were not meeting the 4th Amendment's requirement for reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit was filed by immigrant rights groups, alleging that agents have been unlawfully targeting individuals at places like car washes and bus stops. The order also mandates that detainees at a specific downtown facility be given 24-hour access to legal counsel.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle a 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague is facing strong opposition from preservationists and the public. The authority argues that the historic Vysehrad bridge is corroded and can no longer handle the projected increase in rail traffic, proposing to replace it with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of experts, endorsed by Unesco, contends that the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. This conflict highlights the classic urban dilemma of balancing the needs of modern infrastructure with the preservation of historic landmarks.</p>

          <p>This article provides an analysis of the upcoming Wimbledon women's singles final, pitting five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek against the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. The match is notable as neither player has previously reached the final at the All England Club. The analysis suggests the outcome will depend on who better manages the pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek having more big-match experience but Anisimova playing with the freedom of an underdog. Key tactical elements include Swiatek's powerful top-spin forehand and her adjustment to playing further behind the baseline on grass.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a more independent foreign policy course, signaling a shift to an "Australia first" doctrine amid rising global tensions. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interests rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While maintaining the Aukus security pact and the U.S. alliance, the government appears to be recalibrating its relationships with both Washington and Beijing. This assertion of sovereignty comes as Albanese prepares for a state visit to China.</p>

          <p>A judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state of New Hampshire, allowing the case to proceed. The state alleges that the social media platform uses intentionally addictive and manipulative design features to exploit young users, putting them at risk. New Hampshire's Attorney General argues the suit targets the app's "defective and dangerous features," not its user-generated content, a key legal distinction. This case is one of several recent legal challenges by states against tech companies, focusing on product design and child safety rather than content moderation.</p>
