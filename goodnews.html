          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a plasma drive technology that significantly boosts the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones. Wind tunnel tests revealed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could increase an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 percent. This advancement could extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance drones, enabling them to fly for extended periods. The research team, led by Zhang Xin from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre, published their findings in the Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.</p>

          <p>During his Middle East tour, Donald Trump brokered multi-billion dollar tech deals with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, involving the sale of advanced U.S. technology. These agreements stand to significantly enrich tech CEOs like Nvidia's Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman by opening new markets. The deals also break with Biden's policies restricting tech sales to these nations due to their ties with China. Elon Musk's presence highlighted his continued influence, securing a Starlink agreement for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia, and demonstrating Tesla's Optimus robots.</p>

          <p>Japanese automakers are strategizing to mitigate the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars, with measures including focusing on popular fuel-efficient models and potential price increases. Toyota and Honda anticipate significant profit declines due to the tariffs, prompting considerations of shifting production and adjusting pricing strategies.

          <p>With the Trump administration ramping up collection efforts, student loan borrowers are advised to understand the difference between delinquency and default. Delinquency begins after missing a payment, while default occurs after 270 days of non-payment, leading to garnishments. Borrowers should contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in affordable repayment plans. Options for those in default include contacting the Default Resolution Group and pursuing income-driven repayment or loan rehabilitation. (not investment advice)</p>
