          <p>A significant security operation is underway for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to Scotland, where he is staying at his Turnberry golf resort. The US president played a round of golf and is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has prompted protests in Edinburgh and Aberdeen and raised concerns about security costs. Roads around the resort are closed, and a large security presence, including police and military personnel, is managing the area to ensure safety during his stay.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old dog trainer, Christopher Kennedy, who had no prior symptoms, was diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis during a routine pre-surgery scan. With less than a year to live, he was initially hesitant but ultimately agreed to a double-lung transplant, a procedure his brother had not survived. After a successful surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic, his lung capacity is now at 98%. He has resumed his life and his passion for training hospital therapy dogs, viewing his experience as a profound second chance.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its establishment 72 years ago, the People's Liberation Army Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students. The ten women who were accepted achieved top scores on their university entrance exams and expressed a desire to contribute to the nation's defense. The academy, founded in 1953, is a key institution for training China's submarine personnel. This historic move marks a significant development in the roles available to women within the Chinese military, reflecting a broader shift in armed forces globally.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry, the great-granddaughter of 1930s star Will Rogers, reveals that despite being Hollywood's highest-paid actor, his true passion was being a cowboy. Rogers, who made over 70 films, saw his acting career as a means to fund his travels and ranch life, never losing touch with his Oklahoma roots. He was known for his "common man" persona, humor, and friendships with figures like Charles Lindbergh, whom he sheltered after his child's kidnapping. His death in a 1935 plane crash was a global event, remembered for the profound impact he had on bringing people together.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected an attempt to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall effort, backed by supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was seen as a chance to shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the KMT and its allies hold a majority. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face legislative resistance. The vote highlighted deep political divisions over Taiwan's relationship with China, a central issue in the island's politics.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, veteran closer Kenley Jansen, now with the Angels, could potentially be traded, with his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, emerging as a possible destination. Jansen, who spent most of his career with the Dodgers, has expressed a willingness to pitch in any role for a contending team to pursue another World Series ring. With the Dodgers in need of right-handed relief pitching and the Angels unlikely to make the playoffs, a trade could be mutually beneficial. The move would mark a homecoming for Jansen, who once thought he would play his entire career in Los Angeles.</p>

The 39-year-old, chosen by President Zelensky, faces skepticism and overtly sexist criticism, with some dismissing her as a mere loyalist. The article compares her situation to that of other female leaders in the region, like Moldova's Maia Sandu, who overcame similar disparagement to become effective reformers. Svyrydenko, who has extensive experience in international trade and reconstruction, now faces the immense tasks of managing the economy and war effort while navigating a political culture wary of female leadership.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Using a credit card for large wedding expenses can help couples earn significant rewards points or sign-up bonuses, which can be used for a honeymoon. However, this approach is only advisable if the couple has the savings to pay off the balance immediately to avoid high-interest debt. With the average wedding cost rising, experts stress that taking on long-term debt for a short-term event can create significant financial stress for a new marriage. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights the story of Violeta, a smuggled spider monkey being rehabilitated at the Oakland Zoo, to illustrate the suffering these animals endure. The pet trade often involves killing adult monkeys to poach their babies, who then suffer from trauma, malnutrition, and social deprivation. The proposed legislation aims to shut down this brutal industry, which is often fueled by the romanticized depiction of pet monkeys on social media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 25 years of trying to remove invasive smallmouth bass from an Adirondack lake, scientists made a surprising discovery: the fish evolved to outmaneuver them. A long-term study by Cornell University researchers found that the sustained removal efforts created evolutionary pressure on the bass, causing them to mature earlier and at smaller sizes. This rapid adaptation allowed their population to rebound despite the culling, demonstrating how human management can inadvertently drive swift evolutionary changes. The findings highlight the complexity of managing invasive species and the importance of long-term ecological research.</p>
