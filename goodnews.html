          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Monday, reacting to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend, which came after his national election defeat. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.5% and the Topix reached a record high, reflecting investor excitement around potential successors such as agricultural minister Koizumi Shinjiro and deregulation-focused Takaichi Sanae. However, the Japanese yen weakened and bonds continued to sell off, driven by concerns over persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate an extended period of uncertainty for Japan into Q4 2025, even as the market shows a positive, albeit surprising, initial response to the political shift.</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has secured approximately $100 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, marking its eighth financing round in less than two years and bringing total investment to about $280 million. This significant capital infusion underscores the accelerating global race for household robots, particularly those integrating generative artificial intelligence to transform human-machine interaction. The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, and its Quanta X2 robot, designed for advanced cleaning and human-like functionality. While acknowledging that AI for robots still lags behind generative AI advancements, X Square Robot aims for "robotic butlers" within five years and plans for an initial public offering next year.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz claimed his second U.S. Open trophy, and sixth major overall, by defeating defending champion Jannik Sinner in a four-set final with scores of 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. This victory marks Alcaraz's second Grand Slam title of 2025, following his French Open win against Sinner, and propels the 22-year-old Spaniard back to the world No. 1 ranking. The match, delayed by extra security for President Trump's attendance, showcased Alcaraz's superior strength and aggressive forehand, leading to twice as many winners as his opponent. This article highlights the historic rivalry between "The New Two," who have now contested three consecutive Grand Slam finals in a single season.</p>

The 22-year-old Spaniard highlighted his exceptional consistency throughout the event, dropping only one set and losing his serve just three times, a testament to his focused training. This triumph also propels Alcaraz back to the ATP world No. 1 ranking for the first time in two years, fulfilling a major seasonal goal. In contrast, Sinner acknowledged his own play was "very predictable" and expressed plans to implement significant changes to his game to better challenge Alcaraz in their ongoing rivalry.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This discovery is significant as most bodies in the solar system have not cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core, challenging previous assumptions about Mars' internal structure. The finding suggests Mars, like Earth and the Moon, has an inner core, a similar proportion to Earth's, which might revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. This article highlights a major advancement in planetary science, reshaping our understanding of Mars' geological evolution.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, drawn by Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence boom and expectations of an easing U.S. monetary policy, according to Bank of America. While U.S. equities attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020-2024, inflows have slowed this year, with capital now evenly split between U.S. and international markets. Asia is perceived as offering significant stimulus potential, robust competition in the tech space, and more favorable valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks.
