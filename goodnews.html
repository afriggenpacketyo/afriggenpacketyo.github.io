          <p>A new biography examines the life and influence of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of National Review and host of "Firing Line," who is credited with catalyzing the modern conservative movement in America. The article details how Buckley's intellectual and cultural politics elevated figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, reshaping the Republican Party. It explores the line from Buckley's foundational work to the rise of President Donald Trump, suggesting that Trump's anti-elite populism has roots in the critique of liberalism that Buckley championed decades ago. The analysis portrays Buckley's legacy as complex, blending civility with a movement that ultimately led to today's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The upcoming holiday-shortened trading week will be heavily influenced by key labor market data, including the JOLTS report and the monthly nonfarm payrolls figures. Investors are closely monitoring these indicators for signs of economic softening, which could impact the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. Additionally, the market will be watching for policy updates from the White House regarding trade negotiations and the progress of the Republican tax and spending bill in Congress. These economic reports and political developments are expected to be the primary drivers of market sentiment in a week with light corporate earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has significantly altered its welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own Labour backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the initial plans, which included cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), were mishandled and that the government has now shifted its approach. Key concessions include limiting PIP cuts to new claimants and allowing the health-related component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a major defeat for the prime minister but raising questions about his leadership.</p>

          <p>The upcoming film "Superman," directed by James Gunn, aims to present a more vulnerable and relatable version of the iconic superhero. Actor David Corenswet, who takes on the role, emphasizes that he is not trying to replicate Christopher Reeve's classic portrayal but rather embody the character's inherent loneliness and desire for human connection. Gunn explains that his Superman is not indestructible and that the story explores the challenge of being a good person in a world filled with meanness. The film, the first from the newly branded DC Studios, seeks to re-imagine the Man of Steel for a modern era.</p>

          <p>British sports car manufacturer Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it is committed to its UK operations and does not plan to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk. The meeting was prompted by reports that the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, a move that would have threatened 1,300 jobs. Lotus had paused production in May due to U.S. tariffs, but with those duties set to be reduced, the company insists the UK remains the "heart of the Lotus brand" and it is exploring options to enhance global competitiveness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to financial experts, the most significant mistake Americans make when planning for retirement is simply waiting too long to begin saving. Procrastination during one's 20s and 30s, often with the intention of starting after earning more or paying off debt, results in the loss of decades of potential compound interest growth. Another critical error is focusing solely on a total savings number rather than creating a reliable income strategy for retirement. Experts advise starting immediately, even with small amounts, to build the habit and take advantage of employer matches and the power of long-term investing. (not investment advice)</p>

Khosrowshahi also addressed the future of the company, including the expansion of robotaxi services, which he believes can grow alongside human driving for the next decade. The CEO, an immigrant from Iran, also spoke on the importance of the U.S. remaining a welcoming country for those seeking to build a life.</p>

This growing depth of talent is attributed to factors like Andy Murray's inspiring success, improved training facilities, and players developing through the U.S. college system.

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan to partner with major food retailers and manufacturers to encourage customers to make healthier choices. Under the voluntary strategy, businesses will decide on methods such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to make nutritious food more appealing. The plan, part of a broader 10-year NHS strategy, aims to tackle rising obesity rates, which cost the health service ¬£11 billion annually. While the Health Secretary framed it as a collaborative approach, critics from the opposition have labeled it a "nanny state" measure.</p>

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate underlying unhappiness in a relationship, even if it's not consciously recognized. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, are genuinely curious about each other's inner worlds, and take accountability for their mistakes. According to research, negative answers in these areas can point to a lack of emotional intimacy, trust, and teamwork. The article advises that if these core components are missing, it may be time for couples to reflect on their connection.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the most appropriate framework for his coalition government following the crucial House of Councillors election in July. The prime minister called securing a majority in the upper house a "must-attain" goal for his Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, Komeito, though a recent poll shows half of voters want the ruling bloc to lose control. The election is seen as a verdict on Ishiba's government amid public frustration with inflation and stagnant wages. The outcome will determine the political landscape and the stability of his administration moving forward.</p>

          <p>A new analysis argues that despite statistics showing Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, they are actually leading a new sexual revolution by challenging traditional definitions and political control over sex. The article posits that this generation, shaped by the post-Roe era and online discourse, views sex and identity through a highly political lens. They are redefining concepts like virginity and resisting gendered expectations, all while facing increased legislative restrictions on sexual and reproductive freedom. This has created a generation that is both more progressive in its thinking and more fearful of the consequences of physical intimacy.</p>
