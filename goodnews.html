          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has identified the remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Bowden, 29, was serving aboard the USS California when it was sunk, resulting in the deaths of over 100 crew members. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades but were successfully identified using modern dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis after being exhumed in 2018. Bowden's surviving family has been notified, and he will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

          <p>Researchers at UCLA have found that a new treatment strategy significantly delays disease progression for men with recurrent prostate cancer. The study, presented at the ASTRO annual meeting, combined standard radiation therapy with a PSMA-targeted radioactive drug. Patients who received the combination therapy remained disease-free for a median of nearly 18 months, compared to about seven months for those who received radiation alone. This approach could offer a significant benefit by delaying the need for hormone therapy, which often comes with challenging side effects for patients.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in average 30-year fixed mortgage rates, from 6.93% in January to 6.34% currently, has resulted in significant potential savings for homebuyers. For a $700,000 loan, this decrease translates to a monthly principal and interest payment reduction of approximately $273, amounting to over $3,200 in annual savings. Over the full 30-year term, borrowers could save nearly $100,000 in total interest payments. The article also explores refinancing options and advises borrowers to compare offers from multiple lenders to secure the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After experiencing significant difficulty conceiving, Marissa Chase of the Bay Area was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and often underdiagnosed cause of infertility. Affecting about one in ten women of reproductive age, PCOS can prevent regular ovulation, making natural conception difficult. After receiving successful treatment at a fertility clinic, Chase is now a mother and advocates for greater awareness of the condition. She encourages others facing similar challenges to seek medical help early, sharing her story to offer hope and emphasize the importance of a proper diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Shares of Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, surged over 20% after it announced a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change could potentially bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose stocks fell on the news. The new model aims to eliminate unnecessary markups on FICO scores and give lenders more choice in how they access and price them. The move was praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director as a creative solution to make credit markets more competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. The rise in deliveries was partly driven by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of the quarter. Despite the year-over-year increase in deliveries, vehicle production for the quarter saw a slight decline. The company's performance was hampered by a sales slump in Europe but offset by strong demand in the U.S. ahead of the policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's vehicle sales saw a significant rebound last quarter, rising 7% year-over-year, largely due to customers rushing to utilize a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles before it was eliminated. This marks the company's first year-over-year sales increase in three quarters, following a period of decline attributed to market saturation and brand damage from CEO Elon Musk's political activities. While the sales boost provides a positive sign, analysts caution it may be a temporary "sugar rush" driven by the expiring credit rather than a structural turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock the company's stock value and allow it to restart its share buyback program.
