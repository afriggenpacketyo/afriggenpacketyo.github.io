          <p>The Keeneland September Yearling Sale, a major thoroughbred auction, achieved a record $531.7 million in sales, a significant increase attributed to tax incentives from the Trump administration. A key factor is the renewal of "bonus depreciation," which allows buyers to write off 100% of a racehorse's purchase price in the first year. This tax advantage has spurred investment in the highly speculative market, with 56 yearlings selling for over $1 million each. While breeders celebrate the boom, some experts caution that many buyers may ultimately face financial losses on their high-priced investments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Parent company Seven & i Holdings is planning a major overhaul of its U.S. 7-Eleven stores, aiming to replicate the success of its Japanese counterparts by focusing on high-quality prepared foods. The company will invest over $13 billion internationally to upgrade stores and supply chains, introducing popular items like Japan's famed egg salad sandwich. This strategy seeks to shift the brand's image from a typical convenience store to a destination for fresh, affordable meals. The move comes as U.S. consumer interest in Japanese convenience store culture, popularized online, continues to grow.</p>

Soliman describes his 72-day ordeal in an Ohio county jail as dehumanizing and traumatizing, comparing it to his previous detention in Egypt. His release marks a significant development in his case, as he is expected to have his visa status fully restored. His story highlights the experiences of those caught in the administration's aggressive deportation campaign and the legal battles faced by immigrants seeking asylum.</p>

          <p>According to exclusive data from JLL, the U.S. office market is experiencing a significant recovery, with investor demand strengthening considerably in the first half of 2025. Total industry transaction volume increased by 42% year-over-year to $25.9 billion, and the number of bids on transactions rose by 50%. This resurgence is driven by lower interest rates and a "flight to quality," with institutional investors showing renewed appetite for top-tier office properties. The report suggests this momentum will likely propel both leasing metrics and property valuations higher in the coming years (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that U.S. Latino immigrants generated $1.6 trillion in GDP in 2023, contributing to a total U.S. Latino purchasing power of $4.1 trillion. Research conducted by Arizona State University shows that the economic impact of this cohort grew by 50% since 2015, driven by factors like increased education and entrepreneurship. This economic data is presented as the Trump administration pursues a large-scale removal of undocumented immigrants, a move economists warn could reduce total U.S. GDP by as much as $2.3 trillion (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A prominent internet trend in 2025 involves users shamelessly sharing their own embarrassing or foolish moments online for viral consumption, a phenomenon dubbed "embarrassment porn." From travelers accidentally boarding flights to the wrong continent to people broadcasting their social faux pas, this content thrives on a lack of shame. This trend contrasts with the previous generation's fear of being labeled "cringe" for earnest or awkward behavior. Experts suggest Gen Z's comfort with this content stems from a greater awareness that owning one's embarrassment can destigmatize it and reinforce a sense of relatability.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have made baseball history by overcoming a 15.5-game deficit to take sole possession of first place in the American League Central division. After defeating the Detroit Tigers 5-1, they became the first major league team to erase such a large deficit to lead a division. The team's remarkable turnaround has been fueled by an 18-5 record in September and exceptional performance from their starting pitchers. With only four games remaining, the Guardians now control their own destiny for a postseason berth.</p>

          <p>This opinion article praises late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for his refusal to capitulate to pressure from the Trump administration, which led to his temporary suspension from ABC. The author frames Kimmel's defiance as a notable act of courage in an environment where many powerful individuals and corporations have acquiesced to political intimidation. The piece argues that such capitulation by leaders in business, media, and politics has amplified threats to democratic norms like free speech. It contrasts the actions of these elites with the resilience shown by ordinary citizens and activists who continue to resist.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce a new investment program, "Pride in Place," aimed at revitalizing more than 330 "overlooked" communities across the country. The funding will support local projects like improving high streets, tackling litter, and building new sports grounds, with an emphasis on community involvement in decision-making. The plan also encourages councils to use existing powers to buy and repurpose derelict buildings and block new betting and vape shops. The Conservative opposition criticized the move, claiming the investment would be offset by Labour's tax policies.</p>

The positive performance is attributed to tight cost controls, an improved gross margin, and a stronger customer offering under CEO Daniel Erver. While the company's autumn collections have been well-received, it warned that the full impact of U.S. tariffs on imports could lead to price increases later in the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Patricia Lockwood's latest novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," offers a mind-opening exploration of living with long COVID. The book follows a writer, closely resembling Lockwood herself, as she navigates the persistent and disorienting effects of the illness, including memory loss, fever, and cognitive changes. The review highlights Lockwood's poetic prose and her ability to capture the alienating yet sometimes strangely interesting experience of chronic illness. The narrative avoids a simple resolution, instead dwelling in the complex, ongoing reality of a life and mind fundamentally altered by sickness.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute between the United States and Norway appears to be settling, according to Norway's foreign minister. The disagreement arose after Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from U.S. company Caterpillar, citing the use of its equipment by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank. The U.S. State Department had expressed it was "very troubled" by the decision, and some Republican lawmakers suggested retaliation. The Norwegian government has since clarified that the divestment was an independent decision made by the central bank's board based on ethical guidelines, not a government policy.</p>
