          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. Judge Michael Farbiarz issued a preliminary injunction, citing potential damage to Khalil's career, reputation, and freedom of speech. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's activities compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. While the administration can still pursue deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application, the judge found that the primary reason for detention was Rubio's determination.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has experienced a relative calm after a night of curfew enforcement and mass arrests following days of protests sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration raids. Mayor Karen Bass attributed the unrest to the federal government's immigration actions, which she said have provoked fear and panic among residents. National Guard troops have been deployed to assist in quelling the unrest, and federal prosecutors have charged individuals for violent acts against law enforcement. The protests, which have also spread to other U.S. cities, have intensified the political row between the Trump administration and state officials.</p>

While the NHS and defence are considered the "big winners," some critics are calling the plans a "reckless splurge" that voters will be paying off for years. The review is seen as a rejection of austerity, but concerns remain about the impact on other departments and the likelihood of future tax rises to balance the books.

          <p>The White House attempted to clarify President Donald Trump's threat to use "heavy force" against protesters at the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president supports peaceful protests and the First Amendment, but does not support violence or assaulting law enforcement officers. Trump's initial comments had raised concerns about the administration's response to dissent, particularly following the deployment of troops to Los Angeles to quell immigration protests. Security measures are being implemented for the parade, which celebrates the Army's 250th anniversary.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of the posts he made about President Donald Trump during their social media feud. Musk's statement comes after Trump indicated he was open to reconciliation in a recent interview. The two had previously clashed after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had also made unsubstantiated claims about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to a public fallout and threats to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies.</p>
