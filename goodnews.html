          <p>Consumer goods giant Nestle has announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs as part of an accelerated cost-saving program under its new CEO, Philipp Navratil. The move, intended to improve operational efficiency, involves slashing 12,000 white-collar positions and 4,000 other roles over two years. Following the announcement, Nestle's shares surged nearly 9%, boosting the European food and beverage sector, as the company also reported better-than-expected organic growth in its third quarter despite challenges in its Greater China business.

Grabow, who only learned to swim at age 59 to compete in triathlons, serves as an inspiration, demonstrating that it is never too late to take on new challenges and achieve remarkable athletic feats.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that South Korea's democracy remains resilient and its alliance with the United States is strong, despite a recent period of political turbulence that included a declaration of martial law. The author argues that the peaceful election of President Lee Jae Myung's new government reaffirmed the nation's commitment to constitutional order. The piece refutes claims that the new leadership is undemocratic or anti-Christian, emphasizing that legal proceedings against the former administration are being handled independently and that religious freedom is a core value.</p>

Their return displaces the Salford Red Devils, who were ranked lower due to financial issues and a difficult season, marking a significant shift in the league's composition as it expands to 14 teams.</p>

          <p>This article provides analysis on several key topics in international football. It questions whether Italy, despite being Euro 2020 champions, could miss a third consecutive World Cup due to ongoing qualification struggles. The piece also examines why Liverpool's $155 million signing Florian Wirtz has had a slow start, suggesting his teammates are failing to convert the chances he creates. Finally, it notes that the U.S. Men's National Team is beginning to show positive signs of development under coach Mauricio Pochettino after a period of poor performances.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Explore 'Death Fold' Proteins to Control Programmed Cell Death for Disease Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying "death fold" proteins, which can trigger a cell's self-destruction, in hopes of controlling them to treat diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. In conditions like Alzheimer's, brain cells die too early, while in cancer, harmful cells fail to die. Scientists at the Stowers Institute have found that these proteins can implode and form a structure that initiates a chain reaction killing the cell, a process they believe could be manipulated to either preserve healthy cells or eliminate diseased ones.</p>

          <h2>Transit Advocates Divided on the Merits of Making City Bus Services Free</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The proposal to make city buses free, championed by New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, has sparked a debate among transit advocates. Supporters argue that eliminating fares would increase ridership, improve equity, and speed up service by allowing all-door boarding. However, critics suggest that the funds would be better spent on improving service frequency and reliability, which they believe are bigger drivers of ridership than cost. The mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares after struggling with funding, highlight the financial and logistical challenges of such a policy.</p>

          <p>As U.S. health insurance premiums continue to rise, a small but growing number of companies, from large firms like Boston Consulting Group to startups like Bartesian, are covering the full premium costs for their employees. These employers offer zero-premium health plans as a powerful recruitment and retention tool, believing that a healthy workforce is more productive. While this benefit represents a significant investment for the companies, they see a payoff in employee loyalty and well-being, providing a stark contrast to the rising costs faced by most American workers.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two major unions, who argued the layoffs were not an essential service and were politically motivated. The judge cited public statements by President Trump and his budget chief as evidence of political intent, providing a temporary reprieve for workers at over 30 agencies who had begun receiving layoff notices.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled an ambitious action plan to double its electric vehicle (EV) charging capacity by 2027, aiming to support a network of over 80 million EVs. The plan, released by the National Development and Reform Commission, includes adding 1.6 million new fast chargers in urban areas and upgrading older infrastructure. This major expansion is designed to address issues like uneven network layout and insufficient services, further bolstering the country's rapidly growing new-energy vehicle market, which already accounts for nearly 58% of domestic passenger car sales.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific research indicates that women may require more sleep than men, a need influenced by both biological and social factors. Studies show women sleep slightly longer on average and may need up to 20 extra minutes to support complex brain functions, with sleep quality fluctuating with the menstrual cycle. Beyond biology, societal demands and the burden of domestic labor contribute to a greater "sleep debt" for many women, impacting their mental and physical health. Experts note that women's bodies appear to have a biological resilience, but they also report insomnia at twice the rate of men.</p>

          <p>Uruguay has passed a law legalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so. The "Dignified Death" bill, approved by the Senate, allows mentally sound adult citizens with terminal, irreversible diseases to choose a medically assisted death. The legislation, which does not permit assisted suicide, reflects Uruguay's long history of socially liberal laws and has strong public support, with over 60% of the population in favor. This move distinguishes Uruguay from its neighbors, where the practice is largely decriminalized but not legally regulated.</p>
