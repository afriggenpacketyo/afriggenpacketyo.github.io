          <p>New federal requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID-19 shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. Scientific advisors are debating whether to continue recommending immunization for all Americans or switch to a risk-based strategy. The FDA has requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the need for the vaccine in children under 12. Some experts fear these changes could undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule.</p>
