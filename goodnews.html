          <p>The United States has declared its alliance with South Korea as "ironclad" following Lee's victory in the South Korean presidential election. This statement underscores the continued strong relationship between the two countries, particularly in the face of regional security challenges. The reaffirmation of the alliance suggests a commitment to maintaining stability and cooperation in the Korean peninsula and the broader Asia-Pacific region. The alliance has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy in Asia for decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The USDA has temporarily halted its request for states to hand over sensitive data about SNAP recipients after a lawsuit was filed alleging the directive violated federal privacy laws. The USDA's demand included names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses of people who had applied for or received SNAP benefits over the past five years. The agency cited President Trump's executive order calling for "unfettered access" to data from state programs receiving federal funds. A coalition of SNAP recipients and advocacy groups sued the USDA, arguing the request was unlawful and lacked proper procedures for data collection, prompting the agency to pause its data request.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a decline in extended trading after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast, despite surpassing earnings expectations for the fiscal first quarter. The company's revenue increased by nearly 20%, but costs also rose due to increased spending in sales and marketing, research and development, and administration, partly related to a software outage last summer. While CrowdStrike raised its full-year earnings guidance, it maintained its revenue expectations, leading to investor concerns. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program and previously announced plans to cut 500 employees.</p>

Senate Republicans are also expected to hold a closed-door conference to discuss the bill's parameters, as GOP leadership aims to expedite its progress in the upper chamber.

          <p>Jamie Smith's selection as an opener for England's cricket team demonstrates the team's commitment to aggressive, pressure-inducing batting, a philosophy known as "Bazball." Despite other potential candidates, Smith's style aligns perfectly with coach Brendon McCullum's vision for the team. Smith's ability to score rapidly and put bowlers under pressure was evident in the third ODI, where he excelled against good-length deliveries. England's fascination with Smith is based on his potential to perform exceptionally in various situations, making him a valuable asset to the team.</p>

Supporters argue that the current minimum wage is insufficient to cover basic needs, while opponents warn of potential economic consequences. The campaign has the backing of L.A.

          <p>A U.S. judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care to transgender inmates, despite an executive order by President Trump to halt funding for such care. The ruling allows a group of over 2,000 transgender inmates to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order. The judge ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations, but not surgical care. The decision was based on the likelihood that the inmates would succeed in their lawsuit, as the bureau did not analyze the impact of cutting off previously deemed medically appropriate treatments.</p>
