          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with President Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts and Medicaid changes, despite facing opposition from Democrats and internal dissent. The legislation, labeled the ‚Äúbig beautiful bill,‚Äù aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cut and enact his campaign pledges on tips and overtime pay, with cuts to Medicaid and food stamps to offset costs. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence in passing the bill quickly, but conservative lawmakers are pushing for deeper Medicaid cuts, while Republicans from high-tax states are concerned about limitations on state and local tax deductions. The bill faces further challenges in the Senate, where some Republicans have voiced concerns about its fiscal responsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pete Rose's daughter, Fawn, shared her emotional reaction to the news that MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred lifted Rose's ban from baseball, making him eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. The announcement came just before a celebration for Rose, who died in September. Fawn praised Manfred for his graciousness during discussions about her father and expressed gratitude for the overwhelming love and support from Cincinnati fans. Rose, who admitted to gambling in 2004, had been ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration due to the ban, but this changes with the new ruling which is likely to be up to the Classic Baseball Era Committee in December 2027.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses and accused of spreading Hamas propaganda and having connections to a suspected terrorist. The judge refuted claims he had ties to Hamas through his wife, whose father was a government official in Gaza. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings.</p>

          <p>While some Afrikaners have accepted President Trump's offer of refugee status in the US, many others remain committed to staying in South Africa. Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, a social media influencer, expressed his pride in being part of South Africa's journey and contributing to its success. However, Ilse Steenkamp, who lost her land after an invasion, sees herself as a persecuted minority and supports the refugee program. The US embassy in South Africa clarified that applicants need to be of South African nationality, Afrikaner or from a racial minority, and able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. Attorney Mark Geragos praised the judge's decision and stated that the resentencing will reverberate in the criminal justice system. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before being sent to the governor's office, with family members expressing hope for their release.</p>

          <p>Residents in Richmond, California, are puzzled by a series of dead birds found in their neighborhood, with some suspecting electrocution. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has evaluated two birds collected by PG&E, identifying them as a European Starling and a Mourning Dove, and determined they showed signs of trauma potentially caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. While PG&E stated that the birds showed no evidence of electrocution and that the pole is compliant with avian safe guidance, residents continue to believe that electrocution is the cause.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas and reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The governor emphasized the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis, praising Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener for sponsoring the bills. Newsom's revised budget proposal includes provisions to expedite permit deadlines, allow larger housing projects to use CEQA streamlining, and create a fund for affordable housing near public transit. These measures seek to accelerate urban infill and address the state's high cost of living.</p>

The initiative aims to boost foot traffic and support local businesses, which have suffered since the pandemic, by creating an "Entertainment Zone" between Wilshire Boulevard and Broadway, effective from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. every Friday through Sunday. Participants must be 21 or older, wear a wristband, and purchase drinks from licensed businesses, with officials hoping to revitalize the once-thriving commercial district.</p>

Despite the positive trend, the CDC praised President Trump for his declaration of the opioid crisis as a public health emergency in 2017, the new data was released as Mr. Trump‚Äôs health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was testifying on Capitol Hill about the administration‚Äôs proposed cuts to many federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, experts fear that proposed funding cuts to federal health programs could undermine this progress.</p>

The trial was one of the first to be televised gavel to gavel to a national audience and foreshadowed the public‚Äôs obsession with the O.J. Simpson trial, and the explosion of true-crime programming today. Lawyers for the Menendez brothers invoked the criminal justice policies of the era ‚Äî three-strikes laws, punitive long sentences and a rising prison population ‚Äî to argue that under today‚Äôs mores the brothers merited a second chance.</p>
