          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the sixth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin. Forecasters predict it will remain over open waters, strengthening into a hurricane by Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday. Located approximately 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, it is currently moving north at 10 mph, and is expected to move well east of Bermuda. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously forecast an above-normal hurricane season this year, anticipating between 13 and 18 named storms, with five to nine expected to become hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Max Dowman, a remarkable 15-year-old talent, delivered a dazzling Premier League debut for Arsenal against Leeds, becoming the club's second-youngest player. The midfielder, who has trained with the first team since age 14, showcased exceptional skill, winning two penalties and exciting the home crowd with weaving runs. Manager Mikel Arteta highly praised Dowman's maturity, stability, and hunger, noting he has never witnessed such conviction in a 15-year-old to deliver on the field. With potential injuries to key players like Bukayo Saka, more significant opportunities may arise for the promising young winger in what could be his breakthrough season.</p>

          <p>Rams second-round draft pick Terrance Ferguson made an impressive preseason debut against the Browns, showcasing his potential as the heir apparent to veteran tight end Tyler Higbee. After missing the first two preseason games due to a hamstring injury, Ferguson delivered a significant 33-yard over-the-shoulder catch and a subsequent 15-yard gain. Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's performance, noting his "nice pace to his game" and expressing satisfaction with getting him on the field. This strong showing suggests Ferguson will be a significant factor in the tight end group, which also includes Colby Parkinson and Davis Allen, as the team looks to finalize its 53-man roster.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has significantly outpaced his rivals in fundraising for the New York City mayoral contest, pulling in over $1 million between early July and mid-August. This financial dominance is mirrored in his polling numbers, where he leads by a substantial 13-19 points against his nearest rival, former governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, known for progressive proposals like rent freezes, free buses, and city-run grocery stores, has amassed considerable campaign funds and is eligible for millions more in public matching funds. Despite receiving a large PAC donation from a hedge fund billionaire's daughter, his campaign maintains a strong grassroots focus.</p>

          <p>Beirut's historic Hamra Street is witnessing a significant cultural revival with the reopening of Le Colisee, a once-revered cinema, as the Lebanese National Theater. This initiative, driven by a civil society NGO and volunteers, aims to preserve cultural identity and offer shared spaces despite Lebanon's ongoing economic collapse and political instability since 2019. Hamra, historically a melting pot where Christians and Muslims lived side-by-side, seeks to overcome national divisions and foster unity through art, reminiscent of its vibrant golden era. The theater even served as an emergency shelter for internally displaced people, embodying resilience and hope for the future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. The ruling expands previous restrictions, asserting that the administration's executive order to cut funds based on local immigration policies is likely unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. Sanctuary policies typically limit local resources for federal immigration enforcement, not prohibiting federal action or judicial warrants. The White House stated it expects to ultimately win on appeal, arguing sanctuary cities impede law enforcement and endanger American citizens, but the injunction protects the jurisdictions for now.</p>

          <p>Ron Howard's new film "Eden" dramatizes the true, lurid story of disenchanted Europeans who, seeking a handmade utopia on a remote Galapagos island in the 1930s, descended into petty power struggles and murder. The article describes the movie as a "sticky, sweaty hoot," praising its effective casting and disreputable beach-read pacing, despite its potentially shallow insights into the human condition. Starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney, the film explores the unraveling of societal norms and the raw nature of human behavior in isolation. The review suggests it's an entertaining, if melodramatic, watch.</p>

Her performance earned high praise from head coach Bryan Easson, who called her a "world-class finisher," and former players, solidifying her reputation as a crucial player for Scotland's campaign as they eye the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>David Mackenzie's "Relay" is a smart, paranoid thriller featuring Riz Ahmed as Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer who helps potential whistleblowers disappear using a unique text-telephone relay service. The article praises the film's nifty premise, which updates the 1970s paranoid thriller genre for the digital age, focusing on escaping dangerously far-reaching entities rather than assassins. The plot follows Ash's efforts to protect a rattled biotech scientist, Sarah, in a "dizzyingly enjoyable" cat-and-mouse chase through New York.

Despite successes, conservation biologists remain deeply concerned about the accelerating rate of species loss, emphasizing the cascading ecological effects when any species vanishes.

Replacing Ange Postecoglou, Frank's tactical approach, balancing defensive solidity with attacking freedom, has quickly won over fans and pundits. The article suggests that securing Frank from Brentford might be chairman Daniel Levy's most significant achievement this summer, especially after the collapse of deals for key transfer targets like Eberechi Eze. Midfielder Joao Palhinha, another new signing, has also excelled under Frank's leadership, earning player of the match honors.</p>

Diplomatic incidents between Russia and Azerbaijan, alongside a perceived weakening of Russia's superpower image, have emboldened these states to pursue multi-vector foreign policies.

Large crowds are anticipated at various festivals and events over the weekend, though travel disruptions due to rail strikes and engineering works are likely.
