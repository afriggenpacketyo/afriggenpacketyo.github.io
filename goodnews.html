          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 00:32:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of offering citizenship to foreign investors, effectively banning the last "golden passport" program in the EU. The court found that Malta's policy made nationality a mere commercial transaction, undermining solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, stating it had raised millions for charitable causes, the court's decision has led to discussions about extending the reasoning to "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for real-estate purchases or other major investments. These schemes raise concerns about security, money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption risks for the EU as a whole.</p>

          <p>The South Texas facility and launch site for Elon Musk's SpaceX has been formally approved as the new city of Starbase after a vote among residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees. The vote tally was overwhelmingly in favor of the incorporation. Musk celebrated the decision, highlighting the importance of Starbase for SpaceX's rocket program, which is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA. Critics, however, worry about Musk's increased control over the area and the potential for restricted access to a local beach and state park for launches, while SpaceX officials emphasize the need to streamline launch operations and manage local infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships have chosen not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name upon marriage. The survey indicates a higher rate among those in their 20s, with over 60% stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. While some political parties advocate for the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose the change, citing concerns about traditional family values. Common-law couples in Japan lack the same benefits as legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

          <p>The 151st running of the Kentucky Derby showcased a dazzling array of hats, from traditional styles to elaborate fascinators and headdresses, despite heavy rain throughout the day. Designer Steven Stolman emphasized the importance of selecting hats that complement the wearer, lamenting the decline of trained milliners who could assist with proper fitting. Attendees braved the weather, showcasing creativity and elegance, with some hats even incorporating rain gear into their ensembles. Despite the challenging conditions, the sartorial splendor of the Derby remained a testament to the enduring tradition of hat-wearing.</p>
