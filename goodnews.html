          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace successfully debuted on the Nasdaq, pricing its shares at $45, which was above the anticipated range. The Initial Public Offering raised $868 million, resulting in a company valuation of approximately $6.3 billion, reflecting strong investor interest in the space technology sector. This development comes after Firefly secured a major NASA contract and achieved a successful lunar landing earlier in the year. Despite reporting a net loss, the company's revenue has grown substantially, and it holds a backlog of projects valued at over $1.1 billion.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly has raised its 2025 financial forecast after reporting second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by soaring demand for its diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss treatment Zepbound. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for fiscal year 2025. The positive financial news was tempered by late-stage trial data on its new experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which showed less weight loss than investors had hoped, causing shares to drop. Despite this, the CEO expressed confidence in the company's strong growth and future prospects.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's new daily oral obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients achieve nearly 12% body weight loss in a 72-week late-stage trial, a result that paves its way to market but fell slightly short of Wall Street's higher expectations. The data caused Eli Lilly's shares to fall while boosting rival Novo Nordisk. While some doctors noted the weight loss was slightly less than injectable alternatives and pointed to discontinuation rates due to side effects, others praised the result as a transformative step for obesity care. The pill offers a more convenient, needle-free alternative that could significantly expand patient access.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly set to visit China at the end of August for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first trip to the country in seven years. This potential visit signifies a continued thaw in relations between the two Asian powers, which had deteriorated after a deadly border clash in 2020. The diplomatic engagement comes as India's relationship with the United States faces strain over trade tensions, including recently announced tariffs.
