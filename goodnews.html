          <p>Texas is advancing Senate Bill 17, which seeks to prevent governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from acquiring land in the state, especially near critical infrastructure. Representative Cole Hefner emphasizes that the bill targets actions and affiliations, not race or nationality, and aims to protect Texans from foreign espionage. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and block land deals posing risks to public health or safety, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful residents, and is set to take effect September 1, with Hefner hoping it will spark a nationwide effort to secure the homeland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, drawn by generous tax incentives like the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate, as well as lower labor costs. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to ¬£1.37 billion. President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries has caused concern in the industry, with some suggesting a federal tax incentive in the US to compete with the UK. The article highlights several films, including 'Barbie' and 'Indiana Jones,' that have utilized UK locations for filming.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not be running for the Georgia Senate race next year, citing her unwillingness to fight for a team that refuses to win. Her decision follows Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's choice not to seek the Republican nomination, leaving the primary field open. Greene's polling numbers against Ossoff lagged behind Kemp's, with one poll showing Ossoff leading her 54%-37%. The Georgia seat is crucial for both parties' Senate ambitions, with Republicans aiming to oust Ossoff and Democrats seeking to maintain control.</p>

          <p>Google will pay Texas $1.4 billion to settle claims that the company collected users' data without permission, according to Attorney General Ken Paxton. The settlement addresses claims related to geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data, with Texas arguing Google unlawfully tracked and collected users' private data. Google spokesperson Jos√© Casta√±eda stated that the agreement settles old claims, some of which relate to product policies the company has already changed. Paxton emphasized that this is the largest settlement won by any state against Google for this type of data-privacy violations.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay $1.4 billion to the State of Texas to settle lawsuits accusing the company of violating residents' privacy through tracking and data collection practices. Attorney General Ken Paxton brought the cases in 2022, citing state laws on data privacy and deceptive trade practices. The suits focused on Google Photos, Nest cameras, and Google Assistant, alleging the collection of biometric data without consent. This settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion agreement with Meta over facial recognition technology, highlighting the ongoing tension between tech giants and regulators over privacy issues.</p>

The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to survive Venus' atmosphere, may partially survive its descent through Earth's atmosphere. While the risk of ground impact is low, the event is expected to be visible as a bright streak in the sky if it occurs over a populated area at night.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled that the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff rate on Truth Social. This conciliatory tone comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The two nations have been in a tense stand-off since Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with a 125% levy on American goods. Analysts suggest that a reduction below 80% could positively impact markets.</p>

The quarantine, effective through October 31, covers the California coastline from Oregon to the Mexican border. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be dangerous or fatal to humans. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing, but officials caution against consuming clams and scallops without removing digestive organs.</p>
