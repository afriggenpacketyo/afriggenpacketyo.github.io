          <p>Tufts University doctoral candidate Rumeysa Ozturk, detained by ICE in March, returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk, speaking at a news conference with Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressed gratitude and faith in American justice. The federal judge said that the Trump administration had not provided any evidence for her detainment besides an op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper last year, the op-ed centered Israel's war with Hamas. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE officers in March, and Judge Sessions said that there was no evidence that she engaged or encouraged violence.</p>

Dyer, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, reflected on how fame led to "bad decisions" and drug use, but the letter prompted him to commit to treatment and reflect on the pain he'd caused his family. He credits his role in EastEnders in 2013 as a turning point when he "had no money" and was in a "weird spiral" of club appearances, drugs, and alcohol. This made him realize how addiction "affects so many people around you, not just yourself.</p>

Her detention stemmed from an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands, which supporters argue violated her First Amendment rights.

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking the activity of the protein‚Äôs tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signalling cell growth. Wang Xin, professor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital, said zongertinib had the ‚Äúpotential to establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC‚Äù.

Gallego suggested the party has become too pure, alienating potential voters and hindering electoral success, citing Joe Rogan as an example of someone "kicked out" of the tent. He touted his own success in Arizona, a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, as an example of how to win by building alliances with those who may not agree 100% of the time. He also said that Democrats messed up by not really focusing on the fact that people were hurting in the last election.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its imported food sources amidst global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming increasingly viable suppliers. Yunnan, the southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a crucial role in regional agricultural cooperation.

Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could serve as an effective way to support the country‚Äôs food security by diversifying its food supply sources, according to Feng Lu, a professor of agricultural economics and management at Yunnan Agricultural University.</p>

While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., this event is due to a "cutoff low," diverting the jet stream back East.
