          <p>Maro Itoje is anticipated to be named captain of the British and Irish Lions for their tour of Australia, making him the first Englishman to hold the position since 2001. The announcement is set to occur at the O2 Arena, where the full Lions squad will also be revealed. Itoje's leadership of England during the 2025 Six Nations, where they finished second, and his endorsement from former Lions, including Matt Dawson, have solidified his candidacy. The Lions are scheduled to play Argentina in Dublin before commencing their Australian tour with a match against Western Force, culminating in a three-Test series against the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>A piece of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. NASA believes that the lander probe, a durable, spherical object about a meter wide and weighing nearly half a tonne, may survive the descent. While the exact landing location is uncertain, experts consider the risk to people on the ground to be low, given that 70% of the planet is covered by water. The capsule's projected flight path spans most of the inhabited world, ranging from London to the southern tip of South America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to reduce interest rates, potentially lowering them to 4.25% from 4.5%, a move that would decrease borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. This would be the fourth rate reduction since last year's peak of 5.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee is closely monitoring the rate of inflation, aiming to keep it near the 2% target, and considering global economic uncertainties, including President Trump's tariff policies. A rate cut could influence mortgage pricing and savings returns, although lenders have already factored in the anticipated change.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has kept its base rate steady at 4.75% following the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its target range. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated a cautious approach to changing monetary policy, preferring to observe data for inflationary impacts from tariffs. This decision aligns with market expectations, as the Fed resists pressure from President Trump to implement rate cuts. The Fed has maintained its interest rate for three consecutive meetings, despite ongoing trade war tensions and Trump's calls for easing funding costs.</p>

          <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is contesting a federal judge's decision to halt the enforcement of a new state immigration law. Uthmeier argues that the law, which makes it a misdemeanor for illegal immigrants to enter Florida, aligns with federal law and that the judge's ruling violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. He asserts that Florida is aiding the United States in curbing illegal immigration and is seeking a stay of the motion from the 11th Circuit Court. Uthmeier emphasizes that he cannot order law enforcement officers to disregard the law, as they are not party to the order.</p>
