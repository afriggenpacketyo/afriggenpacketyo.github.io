          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell explained that the central bank's recent decision to lower its key interest rate was prompted by a weakening labor market, which now outweighs concerns about persistent inflation. He described the current economic landscape as a "challenging situation," with downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation, acknowledging that there is no risk-free policy path. Powell stated the Fed's current stance is "modestly restrictive" but leaves it well-positioned to respond to future economic developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The funds, primarily for medical research, were frozen over allegations of civil rights violations. The judge ruled that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific reasons for the cuts. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges against the administration's use of federal funding to influence policies at elite universities.</p>

These global bodies affirm that there is no new, robust scientific evidence to suggest a causal link and that the medication remains a safe and important option for treating pain and fever during pregnancy. Health authorities from the UK, Australia, and Spain have issued similar statements, cautioning against misinformation and reinforcing current medical guidelines.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian explores the possibility of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez making a run for the Senate or the presidency in 2028, positioning her as a potential force to lead the Democratic party beyond its current aging leadership. The article notes her broad appeal among progressive voters but also points to a perceived shift toward the center that has alienated some of her base. Despite these criticisms, the author argues that AOC's charisma and fighting spirit make her one of the best-positioned figures to challenge Trumpism and reshape American politics.</p>

          <p>A woman named Lara Friedman shared a story of unexpected kindness when a stranger came to her aid during a stressful situation. While walking her 120-pound Rottweiler, The Dude, a sudden barrage of fireworks sent the dog into a total panic on slippery sidewalks, making it impossible for her to get him home safely. A man named Blake noticed her distress, first offering to help walk the dog and then driving both Friedman and The Dude home. The small act of compassion left a lasting impression, reminding her of the goodness of strangers.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is more than just a barometer for the stock market; it's a highly profitable business for its parent company, S&P Global. The company earns hundreds of millions annually by licensing the S&P 500 name and data to financial products like index funds and ETFs, where trillions of dollars are invested. Its dominance is protected by a trusted brand, economies of scale, and its status as a common language for finance, making it difficult for competitors to emerge. However, its increasing concentration in a few large tech stocks has raised concerns about its diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, providing relief for homebuyers. For a $350,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128. This is about $210 less per month compared to the 7.04% average rate at the beginning of 2025, saving a borrower over $75,000 in total interest over the life of the loan. The lower rates have also spurred an increase in refinancing applications from current homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club notes that while megacap tech stocks have driven recent market gains, the banking sector is now experiencing a significant rally. This surge is attributed to the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates following its recent initial reduction. In light of the strong performance of bank stocks like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, Jim Cramer is reportedly considering taking profits on one of the Club's holdings to capitalize on the recent gains in the sector.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, urging support for the Democratic nominee. Her endorsement is significant as many other prominent Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have withheld their support for Mamdani. The reluctance from some party leaders stems from Mamdani's democratic socialist platform and his critical stance on Israel's actions in Gaza. Polls currently show Mamdani with a commanding lead in the race.</p>
