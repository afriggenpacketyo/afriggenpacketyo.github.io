          <p>At a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned the audience to be prepared before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where cameras feature crowd members on the big screens. This warning follows a viral incident at a previous show where a tech CEO and his head of HR were captured in an embrace, leading to the CEO's resignation. Martin joked that fans should do their makeup, a lighthearted nod to the controversy that ensued from the previous concert's unplanned broadcast. The original incident has since become a widespread internet meme.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by the year 2030. This is the first time the government has set a specific target on spill numbers, responding to public fury over the pollution of UK waterways. The pledge comes as data shows serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The government also acknowledged that the sector's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing," but stopped short of committing to its abolition or the nationalization of water companies.
