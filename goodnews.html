          <p>Several British newspapers are leading with stories on the government's new immigration plans, which aim to deport migrants who commit crimes and prevent lawyers from abusing human rights laws to block deportations. The Observer features a photograph of the Trump family and reports on potential corruption within the Trump organization. Other headlines include Danny Dyer's revelations about his drug use during his time on EastEnders, speculation about the cast of the next series of Strictly Come Dancing, and the arrest of a retired policeman for a social media post. The Sunday Times focuses on a businessman profiting from migrant housing, while the Sunday Mirror reports on the Duchess of Sussex's father living in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect mothering is harmful and unrealistic. She suggests that being flawed is essential for children to learn to accept their own imperfections and that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems by the field of psychiatry. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are already good enough, highlighting the importance of give and take in relationships and the value of exposing children to flaws.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party had sought to replace Kim due to concerns about his electability, but PPP members voted against the motion. Kim thanked his supporters and pledged to work towards the nation's happiness, while Han accepted the outcome. The PPP has faced turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the opposition Democratic Party's candidate currently leads in the polls.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn widespread condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum. The proposal, which surfaced ahead of a trip to the Middle East, has been viewed as an affront to Iranian national and cultural identity. The Persian Gulf has been known by that name since at least 550 B.C., and Iranians consider it a symbol of their nationhood. Trump's idea has sparked unity among Iranians, who are often divided on other issues, and has been criticized by both government officials and opposition figures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for Europe to import more American farm products, including beef and chicken, but European officials are resisting due to strict food safety regulations. European Union standards, particularly regarding food, health, and safety, are considered non-negotiable, with concerns over hormone-raised beef and chemically treated chicken. While the U.S. argues its meat production is superior, Europeans prioritize hormone-free, grass-fed products and maintain a robust network of smaller family farms, supported by subsidies and trade restrictions. This disagreement highlights fundamental differences in food culture and farming practices between the two regions.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed an algorithm that allows first-person-view (FPV) drones to execute autonomous aerobatic maneuvers. The algorithm enables drones to perform high-risk maneuvers that are typically difficult for human pilots, potentially surpassing human capabilities in complex flight missions. This advancement draws inspiration from the aerial acrobatics observed in nature, where birds and bats use complex maneuvers for hunting and navigation. The breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, could redefine traditional drone flight paradigms.</p>

Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also expressed skepticism about reducing the consumption tax. This debate comes as opposition parties support a consumption tax cut ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election. Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions to identify alternative ways to support those in need and expressed a desire for the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

The study, conducted across 82 sites worldwide, included a diverse patient population, with a majority from Asian countries.
