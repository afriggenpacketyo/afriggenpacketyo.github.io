          <p>China's largest banks have reduced one-year deposit rates below 1%, causing risk-averse savers to seek alternative investment options. This move, the seventh adjustment since September 2022, has left many households grappling with economic uncertainty and weak income prospects. A client manager at a Shanghai branch of CMB notes a surge in clients inquiring about alternative investments, lamenting the end of reliable returns from bank deposits. Millions of Chinese families now face an increasingly challenging financial landscape due to the decline in deposit yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister after a remark about gifted rice angered the public amid rising rice prices. The incident occurred when the minister joked about not needing to buy rice due to supporters gifting him so much, a comment seen as insensitive during a time of inflation. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister, gambling with his future as underperformance from Koizumi would put pressure on Ishiba's already shaky standing. Opposition parties seized the opportunity to pressure Ishiba to address high rice prices.</p>

          <p>The finance chiefs of the Group of Seven democracies showcased unity in addressing global challenges, including economic imbalances and the future of Ukraine, despite trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. While avoiding direct mention of Trump's tariff regime, the finance chiefs agreed to leverage their economic relationships to tackle global economic imbalances. Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda expressed concerns about the potential effects of Trump's tariffs, viewing the economic uncertainty stemming from the measures as continuing.

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, the highest in over two years, driven by rising rice prices and reduced energy subsidies. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs, as Governor Kazuo Ueda intends to raise rates given price trends. Rice prices have doubled over the year, leading Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to pledge to lower them. The country's prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has reportedly pledged to lower rice prices to below 4,000 yen ($28) per 5-kilogram bag, staking his job on the line.</p>

Three council members voted against the budget, citing concerns over cost-cutting efforts at the public safety agencies.
