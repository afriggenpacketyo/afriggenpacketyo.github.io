          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March, sparking public outrage and accusations of abusing the immigration system to deport international students. Her lawyers argued that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel, which they say is protected by the First Amendment. The judge agreed, stating there was no evidence she posed a threat and that her continued detention could deter others from exercising their First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Individuals can collect Social Security benefits while receiving annuity payments, as Social Security does not restrict income from annuities. However, claiming Social Security before full retirement age may result in a smaller monthly check. Social Security benefits may also become taxable depending on total income, including annuity payments. Consulting a retirement income specialist can help individuals structure their annuity and Social Security timing to maximize income.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity interest rates decreasing, homeowners with a HELOC should consider strategic payoff methods. Taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest can expedite payoff and protect against future rate volatility. Monitoring the interest rate climate allows for larger payments during lower rate periods. Using the HELOC for eligible home repairs and renovations can lead to tax deductions, which can then be used to pay down the HELOC.</p>

Apple still has the option to reject the submission, and is appealing the ruling. This is the latest development in the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple.</p>
