          <p>Coco Gauff triumphed over Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling French Open final, securing her first Roland Garros title with a score of 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4. The American second seed overcame a shaky start, where she trailed by a double break, to find her rhythm and capitalize on Sabalenka's errors. This victory marks Gauff's second Grand Slam singles title, adding to her US Open win in 2023, also against Sabalenka. Gauff expressed that this win was harder than her first, as she didn't want to be satisfied with just one, and Sabalenka conceded that Gauff was the better player. Her victory marks a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.</p>

          <p>Veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers has officially signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worth up to $19.5 million with incentives, including a $10 million guarantee. The announcement, made by the Steelers' senior director of communications, ends months of speculation about Rodgers' future after an unsuccessful stint with the New York Jets. Rodgers, 41, will address the media on Tuesday, following the team's first minicamp practice, and is expected to compete with Mason Rudolph for the starting position, addressing the Steelers' quarterback concerns. Rodgers' arrival in Pittsburgh marks his 21st season in the NFL. The Steelers' quarterback problems are solved, at least for now.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of new head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the England women's cricket team achieved a clean sweep in both the T20 and one-day international series against the West Indies. While this victory provides a positive start to Edwards' tenure, it comes with a cautionary note, as England has historically struggled to perform on the big stage despite dominating home series. The team faces tougher challenges ahead, including India's arrival and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The series win offers a glimpse of potential, but the real test will be whether this "new" England can perform under pressure in critical tournaments.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK just two days after resigning as chairman, taking on a new role leading the party's "Doge team," modeled after President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf had cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time" as his reason for quitting, but now regrets the decision, attributing it to exhaustion from 11 months of hard work. Reform leader Nigel Farage said Yusuf will now have a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media for the party.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent public falling out between President Trump and Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its operations within various government agencies.

The DOGE initiative, led by Musk, focuses on cost-cutting and streamlining government processes. The team's ongoing work suggests that its impact may extend beyond the personal relationship between Trump and Musk.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore cuts to police hiring made by the council last month. The agreement ensures that funds will be identified for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days, reversing a reduction in the number of officers hired in the coming fiscal year. The move aims to address concerns about public safety and invest in emergency response while balancing budget constraints. The restoration of police hiring would require an additional $13.3 million for the coming year.</p>

Attenborough emphasized the crucial role of the oceans in supporting life on the planet and urged leaders to recognize their importance.
