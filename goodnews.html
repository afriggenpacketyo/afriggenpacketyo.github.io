          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as the 10th President of Ireland, securing a landslide victory with an unprecedented 63% of first preference votes, defeating Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. An independent candidate, Connolly was backed by major left-wing parties and pledged to be an inclusive president, advocating for peace, neutrality, and addressing the existential threat of climate change. Her win represents a clear mandate from the people and a significant victory for the combined opposition against traditional parties. Connolly also expressed a desire to see a border poll on a united Ireland during her seven-year term, marking a notable shift in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Sikorsky, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, has introduced the U-Hawk, a fully autonomous variant of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, designed for military operations. This uncrewed aerial system (UAS) offers 25% more cargo space by eliminating the need for a physical crew, enabling it to carry up to 10,000 lbs of supplies or equipment into hostile areas. The U-Hawk can be easily controlled by a single soldier using a tablet, boasts 95% commonality with existing UH-60s for simplified maintenance, and can fly independently or in formation. With a prototype flight scheduled for 2026, this innovation aims to significantly enhance military capabilities and reduce operational risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump is engaging in the latest rounds of trade talks with China in Malaysia, ahead of his highly anticipated meeting with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea. Trump expressed hope for a "very good Meeting" with Xi, aiming to avert further 100% tariffs due to come into effect soon. He also indicated an openness to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time since 2019, provided Washington recognizes North Korea as a nuclear state. These diplomatic efforts highlight complex geopolitical maneuvering in Asia, addressing both economic and security concerns amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Misleading European Sexual Assault Statistics Circulating Online</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" has been debunked as misleading, despite using accurate numbers from the World Population Review. The article explains that cross-national comparisons of sexual assault statistics are problematic due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors across countries. The UK's seemingly higher reported rates reflect its consent-based legal overhaul and counting methods, rather than a higher actual prevalence of sexual assault. Furthermore, claims linking immigration to these rates are unsupported by evidence, with criminologists recommending victim surveys for more reliable cross-country comparisons of actual prevalence.</p>

          <p>Germany is significantly upgrading its maritime reconnaissance capabilities by acquiring eight Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft to detect Russian submarines in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea. This move is part of a broader NATO initiative, with Germany and the UK expanding cooperation in monitoring critical infrastructure and developing long-range precision missiles. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the urgent need for Europe to take on more defense responsibility, sending a clear message to both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin about NATO's resolve and enhanced ability to locate suspicious vessels. This acquisition is a small part of Germany's plan to more than double its defense budget by 2029.</p>

          <p>The recent Louvre heist, involving four masked thieves and nine "priceless" stolen items, has quickly transformed into a viral internet phenomenon, generating countless memes and jokes across social media. One of the stolen pieces, Empress Eugénie's diamond-and-gold encrusted crown, was later found damaged near the scene, apparently dropped during the escape. The public's fascination is attributed to the escapist fantasy of a thrilling crime, offering a stark contrast to more somber news events. Brands and celebrities have capitalized on the event, with the German machinery company that made the lift used in the heist even releasing a cheeky advertisement, highlighting the unusual cultural impact of the theft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Passive investing through broad market exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) may be losing its appeal, as investors increasingly seek diversification beyond the S&P 500. The index's heavy concentration in technology (over 35%) has led to an imbalance, with defensive sectors at record low weights. Consequently, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500 significantly over the past six months. This shift suggests investors are looking for growth opportunities outside of established large-cap tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is actively working to reduce its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that China's recent export curbs are causing significant economic damage to EU industries, forcing companies to suspend production. The EU plans structural changes, including increased recycling—with some companies achieving 95% recovery—and forging partnerships with other raw material-producing countries like Ukraine, Australia, and Canada. This strategic shift aims to secure access to critical resources and enhance Europe's independence in vital sectors, backed by a commitment to use all available instruments if needed.</p>

          <h2>Mark Cuban Advocates Bulk Shopping as a Practical Investment Strategy</h2>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban advocates for bulk shopping household consumables as a practical "best investment," rather than solely focusing on complex stock market strategies. He argues that saving 40% on typical annual expenses for items like toothpaste, toilet paper, and shampoo can yield significant returns, illustrating with an example of $800 savings from $2,000 spent. Cuban also stresses the importance of avoiding credit card debt, emphasizing that such savings are only beneficial if not accumulated through high-interest borrowing. This unconventional advice highlights that sometimes the smartest financial move is practical, not flashy, and rooted in managing everyday expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the historic removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, the ecosystem is experiencing rapid and significant recovery, surprising even experts. Threatened coho and Chinook salmon have returned to upstream habitats for the first time in decades, and diverse wildlife, including bald eagles and beavers, is flourishing. Indigenous youth, who were the first to kayak the entire river post-removal, are inspiring global river restoration movements, connecting communities through environmental stewardship. This project serves as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of collective action in healing massive ecological scars, demonstrating that ambitious environmental wins are indeed achievable.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, surged to record highs for the second consecutive week, driven by encouraging inflation data and robust corporate earnings reports.

Despite an ongoing government shutdown and trade tensions, the market remained resilient, with approximately 87% of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations.

          <p>The Octagon, a historic 10,000-square-foot home in Washington D.C. completed in 1801, holds a significant place in U.S. history, having served as a temporary White House for President James Madison after the British burned the original. Designed by the first U.S. Capitol architect, William Thornton, the building is known for its unique octagonal main room and a past where enslaved people lived and worked in its basement. Now a museum, it has a storied history of spooky occurrences, including unexplained alarms and the lingering scent of lilacs associated with Dolley Madison. The house is currently undergoing renovations to become part of the new AIA headquarters and will play a role in America's 250th Independence celebration.</p>
