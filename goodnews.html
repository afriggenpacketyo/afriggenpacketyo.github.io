          <p>Warren Buffett, at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, voiced concerns about President Trump's trade policies, stating that trade should not be used as a weapon. Buffett emphasized that global prosperity ultimately benefits the United States and its citizens, suggesting that a more collaborative approach is wiser than punitive tariffs. He acknowledged that Berkshire Hathaway faces risks from tariffs and geopolitical events, but the company is unable to predict the potential impact. Buffett's remarks come amidst concerns about a contracting GDP and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As college costs continue to rise, more high school seniors are choosing colleges based on affordability, according to CNBC. Reports indicate that a higher percentage of students are opting for public schools over private ones due to financial concerns.

          <p>Civil rights groups have launched a week-long campaign to condemn President Trump's attacks on Black history, including executive orders targeting the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Freedom to Learn campaign, led by the African American Policy Forum, aims to counter the mass erasure of Black history and culture. The campaign includes educational sessions, demonstrations, and a "Black history challenge" to promote awareness and preservation of Black history. This action comes as the Trump administration attempts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at all levels of government.</p>
