The bank now anticipates a Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) exceeding 11% for the year, revised upwards from approximately 11%. Guidance for net interest income, excluding investment banking and head office activities, was also raised to over £12.6 billion. Despite these positive developments, Barclays' pre-tax profit for the third quarter decreased by 7% compared to the previous year, totaling £2.1 billion, and the bank faced a £235 million charge related to the U.K.'s car loans scandal (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study has ranked the side effects of different antidepressants, revealing significant variations between drugs and their impact on physical health. The research, analyzing 151 studies of 30 commonly used antidepressants, found differences in weight change, heart rate, and blood pressure within the first eight weeks of treatment. Researchers emphasize the importance of matching antidepressants to individual patient needs and health conditions, as these differences can affect treatment adherence and overall health. The study highlights the potential for personalized antidepressant prescriptions to improve patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>The UK's annual inflation rate held steady at 3.8% in September, surprising economists and the Bank of England, who had anticipated a peak in price rises last month. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the rate has remained unchanged for three consecutive months. The Bank of England had previously forecast a peak of 4% for the consumer price index in September before a gradual decline next year. Economists suggest that the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates from 4% while inflation remains elevated, despite the British economy's lackluster growth of 0.1% month-on-month in August (not investment advice).</p>

Washington could reduce tariffs on Indian exports from 50% to 15%-16% as part of the deal. India is also considering increasing its import quota for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S., even with a 15% import duty, and seeking a mechanism to revisit tariffs and market access over time. The U.S.-India relations had soured after Modi met with Putin and Xi in Beijing last month (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Eurostar announced plans to introduce double-decker trains through the Channel Tunnel, marking a first for the cross-Channel rail operator. The company will order up to 50 trains from Alstom, increasing its fleet size by nearly a third. As part of the expansion, Eurostar will invest heavily in the Temple Mills depot in London, the only UK depot able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe. The move aims to increase passenger capacity and facilitate new routes to destinations like Geneva and Frankfurt from London.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed performance as investors analyzed trade data from Japan and reacted to the country's new leadership. Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, ending four months of decline, driven by strong shipments to Asia, while exports to the U.S. decreased. Sanae Takaichi was sworn in as Prime Minister, with Shinjiro Koizumi appointed as defense minister and Satsuki Katayama becoming Japan's first female finance minister. Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed losses to trade just above the flatline, while South Korea's Kospi index rose by 1%.</p>

          <p>Netflix is actively integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into its streaming platform to enhance various aspects of its operations. The company emphasized AI as a key focus in its recent earnings report, noting its potential to improve recommendations, advertising, and content creation. Netflix cited examples such as the use of AI tools to de-age characters in 'Happy Gilmore 2' and to explore wardrobe and set designs for the series 'Billionaires' Bunker'.

          <p>Japanese exports experienced a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, ending four months of decline, driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia. However, exports to the U.S. dropped by 13.3%, despite a recent trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth, while automobile shipments to the U.S. continued to decline. The article notes that policy factors, such as tariffs, appear to have a larger impact on exports than exchange rates. Japan recently appointed Sanae Takaichi as its first female prime minister.</p>

The storm is forecast to bring heavy rains to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with rainfall totals of up to 10 inches. A gradual turn to the north and northwest is expected in the coming days, with the storm potentially lingering over the Caribbean due to weakening steering currents. There is still significant uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of the storm, and the storm may stall near Haiti and Jamaica as a Category 1 hurricane.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned gambling advertisements featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo due to concerns about their influence on children. The adverts, published by Kwiff and Betway, were found to violate regulations against including individuals or characters with strong appeal to under-18s. The ASA cited Hamilton's significant public profile, social media following among youths, and appearance in a video game with a low age rating as factors contributing to the ban.</p>
