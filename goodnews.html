          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The first nationalized service departed on time from Woking to Surbiton, with the government calling the move a "new dawn for rail" focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits. Concerns have been raised by unions over outsourcing staffing for security and cleaning, while the Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on their promises. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that she could not promise lower ticket prices, but assured customers that she would strive to ensure they get good value for money.</p>

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham urges calm after West Nile virus fragments were detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. While acknowledging that mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change, the expert emphasizes that there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date. The public is advised to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide. This summer, Gamston in Retford will undergo mosquito surveillance as part of a national project to understand mosquito activity across Britain.</p>
