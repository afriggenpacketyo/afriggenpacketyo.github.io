          <p>The Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that deemed its tariffs illegal, arguing that the case addresses a significant economic and foreign policy initiative. The administration claims the tariffs promote peace and economic prosperity, while the appeals court decision undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. The ruling in question stated that Trump exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on trading partners using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as the power to impose tariffs primarily lies with Congress, according to the US Constitution. The administration warns that denying tariff authority could lead to trade retaliation and economic catastrophe. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains following a tech-driven rally on Wall Street, boosting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both saw increases, with the latter supported by positive household spending data. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi index also traded higher, while global bond markets remained in focus due to pressure on long-dated borrowing costs. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield rose after a court ruling challenged the legality of Trump administration tariffs, raising questions about future tariff revenues. These positive market movements suggest a degree of investor confidence in the tech sector despite broader economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF) is urging the Senate Finance Committee to question Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the removal of safety protocols for mifepristone, the abortion pill. ROAF argues that the Biden administration's rollback of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements endangers women by allowing abortion pills to be prescribed via telehealth and delivered by mail. The group claims that the removal of these safeguards, which were in place for over two decades, leaves women more vulnerable and shifts costs to taxpayers. The FDA originally required in-person dispensing of mifepristone to ensure women were screened for potential complications. </p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to expedite its review of an appeal seeking to overturn lower court decisions that found most of his tariffs illegal. The request follows a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that Trump overstepped his authority in implementing steep levies on virtually every country. Trump wants the Supreme Court to hear arguments in early November and issue a final decision soon afterward, rather than waiting until the following summer. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argues the appeals court ruling undermines the President's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has initiated aviation training programs for representatives from Southeast Asia to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, particularly the C919. Twenty participants from various Southeast Asian countries are attending a workshop in Beijing focused on safety management, airworthiness certification, and domestically produced large aircraft. This initiative aims to increase the acceptance of Chinese aircraft in the region, which is already leading in deliveries despite the dominance of Airbus and Boeing. The move is part of a broader effort by China to foster economic cooperation with Southeast Asia and challenge the duopoly of Western aircraft manufacturers. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University was illegal, calling it an ideologically motivated assault. Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard's argument that the funding freeze was retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with demands that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars the Trump administration from enforcing them, though the White House plans to appeal. The judge noted the administration's swift termination of Harvard's funding occurred before learning about antisemitism on campus, suggesting it was a pretextual action. </p>
