          <p>After losing her tongue and voice box to oral cancer, Sonya Sotinsky successfully used artificial intelligence to recreate her unique voice, complete with its characteristic sarcasm and intonation. Before her surgery, she recorded hours of audio, including children's books and curse words, which an AI company later used to build a vocal clone. Sotinsky now uses a text-to-speech app to communicate, advocating for better insurance coverage for such technologies, which are often not deemed a "medical necessity." Her story is inspiring research that could lead to broader access for others who have lost their voices.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has officially announced that its highly popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) will return to stores on August 26, marking another early start to the fall season for the coffee giant. Alongside the iconic PSL, the fall menu will feature returning favorites like the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew and introduce new items, including a Pecan Oatmilk Cortado. This seasonal rollout is a key part of Starbucks' strategy to boost sales and customer traffic, which have recently stalled. The PSL has become a cultural phenomenon and a significant revenue driver for the company since its introduction in 2003.</p>

          <h2>91-Year-Old Athlete Successfully Lobbies Peloton to Add Senior Age Brackets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 13:02:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old veteran athlete, successfully campaigned for fitness company Peloton to introduce new age categories for its oldest riders. After discovering that the competitive age brackets topped out at 60-plus, Dorion spent 14 months, with the help of lawyers, advocating for change. In response to her efforts, Peloton has now added 90-plus and 100-plus age categories, allowing senior athletes to compete more equitably with their peers. Dorion, who has completed hundreds of marathons and triathlons, continues to ride her Peloton daily and maintains a rigorous fitness routine.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed during an attack in Laos in 1968, have been officially accounted for, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers killed when their remote tactical air navigation site was overrun by enemy commandos, and their bodies could not be recovered at the time. After decades of recovery efforts, joint U.S.-Laos teams found possible human remains on the mountain earlier this year. Using DNA and anthropological analysis, scientists confirmed the remains belonged to Hall, who will be buried in Kansas in September.</p>

          <p>Several prominent AI-related stocks, including Nvidia and Broadcom, experienced a downturn following reports that the Stargate AI project between Softbank and OpenAI is facing difficulties. The initial plan for a $100 billion investment has reportedly been scaled back, creating uncertainty about the pace of AI capital expenditure. Despite the sector's dip, Morgan Stanley has identified Eaton, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia as companies they are confident in ahead of their earnings reports, citing factors like pricing power and strong demand.

          <p>As employees return to the office, companies are increasingly using technology to understand and improve workspace utilization, with some turning to body heat sensors. Startups like Butlr offer systems that use thermal sensors and AI to anonymously track occupancy, foot traffic, and interaction patterns without using cameras, thus protecting privacy. The data helps companies make informed decisions on office layout, hybrid work schedules, energy efficiency, and even lease negotiations. This focus on data-driven optimization comes as the costs for upgrading and redesigning office spaces continue to rise.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will meet with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm, Sweden, next week for a third round of high-level trade negotiations. The talks aim to build on previous discussions and could lead to an extension of the current pause on high tariffs that the two economic powers have aimed at each other. Since a call between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in June, trade relations have shown signs of thawing. Bessent described the negotiations as being in a "good place," a sentiment echoed by Chinese officials.</p>

The attack occurred on a well-traveled trail, where the cougar bit the child before the father intervened and pulled the animal off. The child was airlifted to a trauma center with injuries but has since been discharged. Park rangers later located and euthanized the animal, which was wearing a GPS collar. Officials emphasized that such attacks are extremely rare in North America.</p>
