          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated that he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year due to concerns about potential upward pressure on inflation. Bostic highlighted that the central bank is trying to balance inflation worries with recession risks, noting that tariffs have been larger than initially expected. He expressed concern about rising inflation expectations, which could complicate the Fed's job of maintaining stable prices and maximum employment. Bostic, while not a current voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, emphasized the economic significance of even reduced tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the third-largest school district in the U.S., is now integrating generative AI technologies into teaching and learning after initially banning them over cheating and misinformation concerns. The district has trained over 1,000 educators on AI tools and is introducing Google chatbots for more than 105,000 high school students. Students are learning to critically assess AI tools and use them responsibly, with educators emphasizing ethical use and fact-checking. This shift aligns with a broader push to incorporate AI skills into education to prepare students for future job demands and compete with countries like China, while also acknowledging potential risks like over-reliance on chatbots and erosion of critical thinking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to decrease by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This nearly 7% decrease means a typical household will pay ¬£1,720 annually for dual-fuel, down from the current ¬£1,849. While this provides some relief, prices remain significantly higher than at the start of the decade, and many households continue to struggle with affordability. Experts emphasize the need for government action to reduce energy bills through home upgrades and support for those facing energy debt.</p>

While no specific target was mentioned, this move signals the government's support for home-made EVs. Since 2017, Beijing has promoted the purchase of electric vehicles by state institutions, with recent guidelines requiring EVs to account for at least 30% of total annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities. The government is also directing departments to purchase EVs priced under 180,000 yuan (US$25,000) to cut costs.</p>

          <p>This article examines how views on friendship have changed over time, highlighting the contrast between passionate bonds between men celebrated in the Renaissance and modern depictions of male friendship. It discusses Aristotle's concept of 'perfect' friendship between men 'alike in virtue' and how women were historically considered incapable of such bonds. The article explores the shift in the 18th and 19th centuries, where women's friendships were idealized, while male bonds were often portrayed as superficial. The author suggests reexamining emotional rules to foster more connections in an age of social fragmentation.</p>

Despite the centrist victories, the strong showing of hard-right candidates indicates a fragmented political landscape.
