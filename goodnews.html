          <p>Conservationist Bindi Irwin has revealed she is recovering and healing after undergoing two major surgeries to treat her severe endometriosis, a condition she battled for over a decade. Doctors removed 51 lesions, a chocolate cyst, and her appendix, finally providing relief from years of debilitating pain that she had felt ashamed of as a young woman. Irwin shared her story to raise awareness and encourage open conversations about women's health issues, which are often dismissed or misdiagnosed. She reports that she is slowly regaining her strength and can now function in daily life without constant pain.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the United States and European nations to offer Ukraine "Article 5-like" security protections. This potential concession, which mirrors NATO's collective defense clause, is being described as a significant development in peace negotiations, as it addresses one of Ukraine's key security demands. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the news, stating the EU is prepared to contribute its part to these guarantees, though details remain to be clarified.</p>

          <p>Cricketer Sonny Baker celebrated his recent call-up to the England national team by taking a hat-trick for the Manchester Originals in their decisive 57-run victory over the Northern Superchargers. The 22-year-old bowler's key dismissals helped restrict the Superchargers to just 114 runs, well short of the target of 172 set by the Originals. The Manchester team's score was anchored by an unbeaten 64 from captain Jos Buttler and a powerful late-innings surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out. The win significantly boosts the Originals' chances in the men's Hundred tournament.</p>

          <p>British actor Terence Stamp, renowned for his roles as General Zod in "Superman" and his Oscar-nominated debut in "Billy Budd," has passed away at the age of 87. Rising from a working-class background in London, his intense presence and dashing looks made him a star of the Swinging Sixties, with notable performances in films like "The Collector" and "Far From the Madding Crowd." After a period of disillusionment, he reinvented his career, later earning acclaim for his versatile role as a transgender woman in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," leaving behind a remarkable and varied body of work.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara, the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, is single-handedly addressing the neurosurgical needs of the country's eight million people. Previously, patients with severe head and spine injuries had no hope of treatment unless they were wealthy enough to travel abroad. Supported by a global network of nonprofits like Mission Brain and dedicated physicians, Dr. Kamara received specialized training and has now begun performing complex procedures, including the country's first-ever spine surgery, at Connaught Hospital. His work represents a monumental step forward for the nation's healthcare system, inspiring a new generation of medical professionals.</p>

          <p>Actor Adam Scott, known for comedic roles in shows like "Parks and Recreation," has earned an Emmy nomination for his lead performance in the acclaimed drama "Severance."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stunning free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a little-known rule infringement. The decision was made because a Crystal Palace player was standing less than one meter away from the defensive wall formed by Chelsea's players at the moment the kick was taken. According to IFAB's Law 13, introduced in 2019, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a wall of three or more defenders. The rule was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting caused by attackers positioning themselves within the wall.</p>
