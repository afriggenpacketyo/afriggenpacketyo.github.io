          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's new domestic spending bill, arguing its economic growth projections are more accurate than those from the Congressional Budget Office. He dismissed concerns about its impact on the deficit and asserted that new Medicaid work requirements would encourage employment rather than cause a massive loss of coverage. Hassett also signaled that several international trade deals are close to being finalized ahead of an upcoming deadline, with the U.S. prepared to send letters to partners to accelerate negotiations.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first home victory at a dramatic, rain-soaked British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The race was marked by chaotic conditions and two safety car periods, which significantly influenced the outcome and shuffled the standings. Norris capitalized on a 10-second penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri for erratic driving during a restart, allowing him to take the lead in the final stages of the race before a massive home crowd. Nico Hulkenberg secured a surprising first-ever podium finish for Sauber.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" are looking back on the film's notoriously difficult production on Martha's Vineyard. Actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb recall a chaotic shoot plagued by a malfunctioning mechanical shark, budget overruns, and on-set tensions, which made them fear the movie would be a complete failure. Despite the many challenges, director Steven Spielberg's innovative approach and creative perseverance turned the troubled production into a cultural phenomenon that defined the summer blockbuster.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have stated that China's military needs to undergo structural changes to effectively combat threats from unmanned aerial vehicles. They argue for the creation of specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid response, addressing the inefficiencies of current systems where such duties are multitasked. This strategic shift reflects the increasing importance of drones in modern warfare, as demonstrated in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine and clashes in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow explores the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, in his latest book. Chernow details how Twain's sardonic humor was often rooted in personal pain and a lifelong fear of poverty, despite his fame and the construction of a lavish home in Hartford, Connecticut. The article highlights Twain's enduring relevance, noting how themes of politics, race, and get-rich-quick schemes in his work continue to resonate in modern America, solidifying his status as a vital presence in the nation's culture.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal came ashore near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning with sustained winds of around 50 mph. The storm is bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to the eastern Carolinas, with flood watches in effect for coastal and some inland areas. The National Hurricane Center expects Chantal, the third named storm of the season, to weaken into a tropical depression as it moves further inland and dissipate by Monday, though it could still cause localized flash flooding.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in northern Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a vital trading center, connecting coastal communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. The site, which contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes, is seen as crucial for understanding the evolution of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was likely impacted by major climate change events.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived not as a symbol of immigration, but as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, designed to be standing on broken chains and shackles. Its meaning transformed over time, largely due to Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus," which reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles." This new identity was solidified with the opening of the Ellis Island immigration center and later championed by President John F. Kennedy, cementing its role as a powerful beacon for immigrants worldwide.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has suggested that UK football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches. Arguing for a "polluter pays" approach, the commissioner questioned why organizers of large events that require a police presence do not pay for the service, which diverts resources from local communities. The proposal comes amid calls for radical police reform to better manage overstretched funding and the demands of modern policing.</p>

          <p>A recent stock market melt-up is being attributed to a growing investor belief that the Federal Reserve will implement a significant number of interest rate cuts in 2026. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, the market is already beginning to price in this future easing cycle, with some economists predicting as many as seven cuts that year. This forward-looking optimism persists despite current signals from the Fed and recent strong jobs data suggesting that even a single rate cut in 2025 is not guaranteed. (not investment advice)</p>
