          <p>The U.S. government has lifted its export controls on chip-design software for China, a move communicated to major industry players including Siemens EDA, Synopsys, and Cadence. These companies, which dominate the electronic design automation (EDA) market, had been required to obtain licenses for such exports since May. Following the reversal, the firms announced they are resuming full access, sales, and support to their Chinese customers. This decision is viewed as a sign of a potential trade truce, coming after China also signaled progress in resuming some technology and rare earth exchanges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated surprising strength in June, adding 147,000 nonfarm payrolls, surpassing the forecast of 110,000. This resilience was largely driven by a significant increase in government hiring, particularly at the state and local levels. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, although this was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate. These robust figures have led market analysts to conclude that a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July is now highly unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of online travel company Tripadvisor surged by 10% following the disclosure of a significant investment by activist firm Starboard Value. According to a securities filing, Starboard has acquired a stake of over 9%, valued at approximately $160 million. Starboard Value is known for taking large positions in companies to advocate for strategic changes, such as cost-cutting measures or leadership adjustments. The move comes after Tripadvisor's stock had a difficult year in 2024, and the company had previously formed a committee to explore potential strategic options. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid shifting economic conditions, including higher interest rates and healthcare costs, financial experts advise seniors to re-evaluate their life insurance policies. Key questions to consider include whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and if current plans align with estate goals. Professionals suggest that while needs may change from income replacement to covering final expenses or legacy planning, life insurance remains a crucial tool. They recommend reviewing beneficiaries, considering trust structures, and comparing different policy types like term and whole life to ensure adequate and appropriate financial protection for their families.

          <p>A new survey by Generation Lab for CNBC indicates that young Americans are surprisingly open to working in the office, with a majority preferring at least three days a week on-site. The study of nearly 18,000 young adults found that after compensation, career development and company culture are more important than remote work flexibility. While not committed to long-term company loyalty, they value regular, in-person feedback from managers. The survey also revealed negative perceptions of major tech companies like Tesla and Meta, and strong support for DEI initiatives, though most prefer to avoid discussing politics at work.</p>

Following a breakout 2024 season where he led the Sun Devils to a Big XII title and the College Football Playoff, Leavitt remains driven by a desire for perfection. He uses a list of top rival quarterbacks as daily motivation, a technique learned from his brother who played in the NFL. Despite his success, Leavitt feels he "left so much on the table" and is focused on outworking his previous performance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market remained solid in June with the addition of 147,000 jobs, a figure that suggests the Federal Reserve will not be rushed into cutting interest rates. While overall hiring was strong, driven by healthcare and government, the manufacturing sector showed notable weakness, shedding 7,000 jobs for the second consecutive month. A recent Institute for Supply Management report indicates that factory activity has been shrinking, with many factory managers blaming President Trump's import tariffs for a collapse in orders. This creates a mixed picture of the economy, with overall resilience masking specific sectoral struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell to 233,000, which was below analysts' forecasts. This data contrasts with recent high-profile layoff announcements from major corporations like Microsoft and Google. The low layoff rate, combined with a stronger-than-expected June jobs report, paints a picture of a resilient labor market, even as some companies implement cost-cutting measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of U.K. government borrowing has fallen, partially reversing a spike that occurred after Chancellor Rachel Reeves became emotional during a parliamentary session. The yield on 10-year government bonds decreased after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly backed the chancellor, stating they work "in lockstep." The initial market panic, which saw bond yields rise and the pound fall, was driven by fears that Reeves might resign, potentially leading to a loss of fiscal discipline. The subsequent market stabilization suggests investors were reassured by the demonstration of political stability and support for the chancellor's fiscal policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the American tradition of setting off fireworks for the Fourth of July, blending personal memories with a humorous exploration of the modern pyrotechnics industry. The author recounts past experiences with his father and embarks on a quest to legally set off a large cache of consumer-grade fireworks on a beach in Maine. The journey reveals a complex web of state and local regulations that complicates this seemingly simple goal. The article humorously catalogues the vast, patriotically and pop-culture-themed fireworks available, ultimately celebrating the simple, chaotic joy of the holiday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed significant housing legislation that provides a model for how the Democratic party can address scarcity and governance challenges, according to this analysis. The new laws streamline the construction of multifamily housing in urban areas by exempting them from parts of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This move represents a philosophical shift away from an anti-development stance that has historically constrained building and driven up costs. By prioritizing material abundance over the objections of some allied interest groups, California Democrats have shown a willingness to tackle a major crisis directly.</p>
