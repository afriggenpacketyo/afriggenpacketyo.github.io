          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedo boats in 1942 during the Guadalcanal campaign. Located over 2,600 feet deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound, the warship was found with its munitions, including depth charges, still intact. The discovery provides new insights into the ship's final moments, disproving the long-held theory that its own depth charges caused the sinking. The find is historically significant as there are no known photographs of the Teruzuki from its time of service.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. In a social media post, the president described it as a "great deal, for everybody" and stated that further details would be released soon. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent trade deal declared with Vietnam, which reportedly surprised Vietnamese officials and has not yet been formally accepted. Indonesia is a significant trade partner, with over $38 billion in goods traded with the U.S. in 2024.</p>

          <p>A new analysis highlights the ten U.S. states best positioned to meet the massive electricity demands of the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. With data centers projected to consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, states with reliable and affordable power are at a significant advantage. The report, which considers grid reliability and electricity prices, names Nebraska, Iowa, and Wyoming among the top contenders. These states offer a combination of low-cost power, often from diverse sources including renewables, and robust infrastructure capable of supporting the 24/7 energy needs of AI operations.

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced it will soon restart exports of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, causing its stock to climb 7%. The move follows an indication from the U.S. Commerce Department that it will resume reviewing license applications for such shipments. This development comes after the chip industry, including competitor Nvidia which made a similar announcement, urged the administration to loosen export controls that had been tightened over national security concerns. Chipmakers had previously warned of significant revenue losses, with AMD projecting an $800 million hit from the restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

The GENUIS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, and the more comprehensive CLARITY Act, which defines regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC, are up for consideration. While the industry is lobbying heavily for their passage, the CLARITY Act faces potential opposition in the Senate due to concerns over the Trump family's financial involvement in crypto projects, which some Democrats argue creates conflicts of interest.

While HBO's "The White Lotus" received widespread recognition with seven acting nominations, the article questions if this reflects a lack of imagination among voters. Key surprises included a drama series nod for "Paradise" and a nomination for Sharon Horgan, while notable snubs included Steve Martin for "Only Murders in the Building" and the critically acclaimed comedy "The Rehearsal."

The lifting of these restrictions is expected to pave the way for renewed engagement, with an official meeting between the EU Parliament's China delegation and China's National People's Congress planned for October. The sanctions were a major obstacle to normalizing ties, and their removal was reportedly a key demand from European officials before formal political meetings could resume after a multi-year hiatus.</p>
