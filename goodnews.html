          <p>President Donald Trump praised the Senate's advancement of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" after four conservative holdouts flipped their votes late Saturday night. Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, and Cynthia Lummis agreed to move the legislation forward after securing negotiations with Republican leadership on deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid. Johnson stated they were promised a vote on an amendment to lower federal Medicaid matching for new enrollees under the ACA. While the bill has overcome this procedural hurdle, final passage is not yet guaranteed, as several Republicans remain non-committal on the ultimate vote.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued four people after their 61-foot sailboat caught fire approximately one mile off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The passengers were able to evacuate safely to a bystander's boat and were brought to shore by the Brevard County Sheriff's Office with no reported injuries. Video from the scene showed thick smoke, and witnesses reported hearing what sounded like explosions as the vessel was quickly engulfed in flames. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are now investigating the cause of the incident.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Gen Z Is Leading a New Sexual Revolution Despite Having Less Sex</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the narrative of a "sex recession" among Gen Z, arguing that while they are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are leading a new sexual revolution. It posits that Gen Z's approach is not about frequency but about redefining sex, gender, and relationships, driven by a deep understanding of their political dimensions. Having grown up post-#MeToo and with the erosion of reproductive rights, many young people are rejecting traditional, heteronormative definitions of sex and virginity. This progressive shift focuses on inclusivity, consent, and dismantling outdated gendered expectations, making them a politically and sexually progressive generation.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Government Secures Path for Welfare Reform Bill After Major Concessions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:58:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government is now in a stronger position to pass its flagship welfare reform bill after making significant concessions to avoid a large backbench rebellion. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that concerns from over 120 Labour MPs led to crucial changes, including limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only. The government also reversed plans to freeze the health-related component of universal credit. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now support the bill, which aims to ensure the long-term sustainability of the welfare system.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on navigating the despair of the current political climate, which she describes as authoritarian, cruel, and complicit in global suffering. She argues that survival depends on embracing duality‚Äîfeeling rage but channeling it into action, and acknowledging reality without succumbing to hopelessness. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Congo and community organizers in the U.S., she posits that collective action, such as marches and local mutual aid, is essential for building community and resisting fascism. The essay concludes that protecting each other's humanity is a powerful form of resistance.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla has transformed from an experimental startup into one of the world's most valuable companies, with its stock up nearly 300-fold. An initial $10,000 investment would be worth close to $3 million today. However, the company faces new challenges, including sluggish 2025 sales, an aging vehicle lineup, and increased competition. CEO Elon Musk is now pivoting the company's focus towards autonomy and humanoid robots, telling investors that Tesla's future value lies beyond car manufacturing, despite Wall Street's skepticism and recent volatility in the stock.</p>

          <p>With the Dodgers' ownership group now holding a majority stake in the Lakers, this article analyzes the future of team leaders Rob Pelinka and JJ Redick. It argues that while there may be temptation to make immediate changes to overhaul a culture seen as mediocre, both men have earned a chance to prove themselves under the new, more professionalized regime. The piece credits Pelinka with building a championship team in 2020 and acquiring key superstars, despite subsequent missteps. It also notes Redick's respectable performance in his first regular season as coach, suggesting he deserves time to grow, before the new ownership makes any final decisions.</p>
