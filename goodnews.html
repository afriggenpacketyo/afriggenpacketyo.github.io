          <p>Max Verstappen, after winning both the sprint and grand prix at the U.S. Grand Prix, now openly acknowledges his strong chance at a fifth world championship, a shift from his previous dismissive stance. He has significantly closed the points gap to McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, gaining 64 points in the last four races. Verstappen credits car upgrades and better understanding of the vehicle for his recent dominant form. McLaren, despite their own struggles and a crash in the sprint, remain optimistic about their pace.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw an uptick at opening, influenced by China's decision to maintain its benchmark lending rates at 3%, as anticipated. This stability comes ahead of China's third-quarter GDP announcement, which analysts predict will show a 4.8% growth. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index recorded gains. The positive sentiment in Asian markets mirrored Friday's close on Wall Street, where U.S. averages rose amidst a softening stance on U.S.-China trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive statue of General Robert E. Lee, have been transformed into an art exhibit in Los Angeles, displayed as melted bronze and graffitied sculptures. Curator Hamza Walker aims to challenge the "Lost Cause" narrative by presenting these symbols of white supremacy alongside contemporary art, fostering dialogue about American history. The exhibit contrasts with President Trump's call to reinstall such monuments. This artistic intervention provides a critical re-evaluation of historical figures and their legacies, particularly regarding slavery and racial injustice.</p>

          <p>To combat workplace burnout and set effective boundaries, career coaches recommend replacing "I can't" with "I don't" when declining requests. "I don't" is presented as a more definitive phrase that discourages negotiation, allowing individuals to firmly protect their personal time and well-being. The article highlights the experience of TV chef Lorraine Pascale, who suffered burnout from an inability to say no. Experts stress the importance of adjusting goals to current capacity and sticking to routines to complete the "stress cycle" and prevent exhaustion.</p>

The 2011-15 plan prioritized "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, giving China a near monopoly in renewables and rare earths. The current 2021-2025 plan focuses on "high quality development" to challenge U.S. tech dominance, creating global economic and diplomatic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational V-level courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications and replace existing Level 3 BTecs. This initiative, part of a white paper on education and skills, also includes an alternative qualification to reduce GCSE maths and English resits. Ministers anticipate students will mix V-levels with A-levels or T-levels, providing practical, employment-focused routes. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association expresses concern about potential gaps, the move seeks to enhance vocational training and improve student outcomes.</p>
