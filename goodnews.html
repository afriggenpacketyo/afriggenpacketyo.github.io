        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is closely monitoring the tensions between Israel and Iran due to its position as the largest importer of Iranian oil and a close political partner of Tehran. Iran exports approximately 90% of its crude oil to China, despite U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's oil sales. China buys Iranian oil at a discounted rate and uses a "dark fleet" of ships to circumvent sanctions, highlighting the economic and political ties between the two nations. Any disruption to oil supplies in the region would directly affect China's energy security and economic interests. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A one-year certificate of deposit (CD) currently offers a slightly higher interest rate than a high-yield savings account, making it a potentially more lucrative option for savers. Calculations show that a $10,000 deposit in a one-year CD at 4.45% would earn $445 in interest, while the same deposit in a high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn $430, assuming the rate remains constant. However, CD interest rates are fixed, while high-yield savings account rates are variable, meaning the CD offers a guaranteed return. With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, locking in a higher rate with a CD may be a prudent choice. (not investment advice)</p>

While officials are not describing it as a "surge," the increased volume is expected to boost trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies.
