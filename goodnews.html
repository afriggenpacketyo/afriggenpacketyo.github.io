          <p>This article from DW examines the varying degrees of success and integration of far-right parties across Europe. While Germany considers banning the Alternative for Germany (AfD), other countries have similar parties in government or leading coalitions, such as the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ), Brothers of Italy, and the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands. The article highlights differences in ideology and approaches among these parties, ranging from anti-immigration stances to criticism of the European Union. The analysis also notes how some parties, like the Brothers of Italy, have distanced themselves from Russia due to the Ukraine war, further diversifying the European political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared a key hurdle in the House after negotiations with conservative holdouts, who initially opposed the legislation due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and increases military and border security spending, is offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Despite progress, the legislation still faces challenges, including conservative demands for stricter Medicaid work requirements and opposition from blue-state Republicans over state and local tax deductions. The bill now moves to the Rules Committee for potential modifications before a floor vote.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of its immigration process and further boost inbound tourism. The system, modeled after the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information in advance. This will allow the Immigration Services Agency of Japan to examine travelers' data for criminal history or illegal stay records, potentially denying boarding to those deemed a risk.
