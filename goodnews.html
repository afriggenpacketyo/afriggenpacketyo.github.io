          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in Texas, particularly near critical infrastructure such as military bases and food processing plants. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse land deals that pose risks to public health or safety. Exemptions are included for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents intending to use the property as a personal homestead. The bill is set to take effect September 1 and aims to secure the homeland from foreign espionage and influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives, such as a 25% tax rebate, as well as lower labor costs and centralized national funding for film. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major U.S. film studios and streaming giants, amounting to ¬£1.37 billion. The article discusses how President Trump's proposal to impose tariffs on foreign-made films could impact the industry and potentially increase costs for moviegoers. It also highlights several films shot in the UK, including Barbie, Jurassic World: Dominion, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, despite being too young for the next Winter Olympics, is gaining attention for mastering two quadruple jumps at the age of 15. Nishino recently landed a quad toe loop in competition and has previously executed a quad salchow. His coach, Misao Sato, notes his significant physical growth, which has required him to quickly adapt to larger boots and blades. Nishino aims to achieve strong results at the world junior championships and Junior Grand Prix Final next season.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back. Experts predict the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact timing and location remain unknown. The spacecraft is equipped with a heat shield designed to survive atmospheric entry, raising the possibility that some parts may reach the surface intact. The article notes that any recovered pieces would legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels, warning of naturally occurring toxins that make them potentially poisonous to humans from May 1 to October 31. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be deadly. The quarantine covers the entire California coastline, and there are no known antidotes for these toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing.</p>
