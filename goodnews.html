        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for Webtoon Entertainment saw a significant jump after the company announced a major partnership with Disney to create a new digital comics platform. The deal will consolidate over 35,000 comics from Disney's Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and 20th Century Studios brands onto a single subscription service. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. While some analysts see this as a validation of Webtoon's platform and a way to diversify revenue, others remain skeptical about the immediate earnings impact due to the necessary investment in building the new infrastructure.</p>

Both sides are now focused on finalizing the remaining details of the agreements.

The investment will be allocated to capital expansion and operational costs, including the development of the U.K.'s largest supercomputer in partnership with a British cloud firm. The announcement coincides with President Trump's state visit to the U.K., where he and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to sign a new technology deal. Microsoft President Brad Smith noted an improved business and regulatory climate in the U.K. as a key factor enabling this significant investment in AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing the date to December 16th to avoid a national ban. The extension follows reports of a "framework deal" in which an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz would acquire a majority stake in the app's U.S. business. This marks the fourth such delay, providing more time for the complex negotiations between U.S. investors and the Chinese parent company to be finalized. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the commercial terms have been largely settled for months but were delayed by broader U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Reignites Debate on Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannual</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 15:37:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed a push for publicly traded companies to report earnings every six months instead of quarterly, an idea the Securities and Exchange Commission is now considering. Proponents, including prominent figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, argue that less frequent reporting would encourage long-term strategic planning over short-term market reactions and reduce regulatory burdens. Conversely, supporters of the current quarterly system believe it provides essential transparency for investors, particularly smaller retail investors who lack access to other research methods. The potential change could have significant ramifications for market dynamics and investor access to information. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contentious provision that would have given the Secretary of State the authority to revoke U.S. citizens' passports for allegedly supporting terrorism has been removed from a larger bill. Representative Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, filed an amendment to eliminate the measure following widespread criticism from civil liberties advocates. The original language was believed to be aimed at pro-Palestinian activists, raising concerns about the weaponization of state power against political speech. The committee stated it did not want the passport issue to overshadow other bipartisan reforms within the State Department policy bill.</p>

          <p>The South American trade bloc Mercosur, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, has signed a free trade agreement with four non-EU European countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. The deal, signed in Rio de Janeiro, aims to deepen economic ties and is presented as a commitment to rules-based international trade amid rising global protectionism. This agreement comes as Brazil seeks to diversify its trading partners, particularly after the U.S. imposed significant tariffs. The Mercosur bloc is also working towards ratifying a much larger and long-negotiated trade deal with the European Union.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the critical factor that prompted China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that while the commercial terms of a sale had been essentially finalized for months, China had stalled negotiations following the imposition of U.S. tariffs. The president's firm stance on national security reportedly broke the stalemate, leading to renewed discussions. An executive order has now extended the divestiture deadline to December 16, allowing time for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of middle- and high-income consumers are shopping at discount stores like Aldi, Dollar General, and Walmart, a trend that has accelerated since 2021. According to data from GlobalData Retail, nearly 28% of high-income households now frequent these chains, up from 20% four years ago. Analysts attribute this shift primarily to persistent inflation, which has eroded the savings of even wealthier households and increased the cost of essentials. In response, discount retailers are actively courting these new customers by remodeling stores, improving the shopping experience, and expanding their selection of premium and name-brand products.</p>

The book covers topics from 16th-century prosthetic noses to modern breakthroughs in xenotransplantation, such as the use of genetically edited pig organs to prevent rejection by the human immune system. Roach also explores futuristic technologies like 3D printing of human tissue, profiling labs working to create functional muscle and even a tiny heart ventricle. However, she expresses concern that recent cuts to medical research funding could threaten this pipeline of innovation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, homebuyers are advised to be strategic as the mortgage rate environment remains volatile. This article suggests that prospective buyers should consider locking in a current rate if it is affordable, as there is no guarantee that rates will continue to fall. It also emphasizes the importance of shopping around with multiple lenders, as their responses to market changes will vary. Finally, buyers are encouraged to explore all financing options, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or purchasing mortgage points, to potentially secure a lower interest rate than widely advertised averages.
