          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the fiscal year 2025, estimating 3.1 trillion yen ($21.6 billion), primarily due to the impact of U.S. tariffs implemented by President Trump. The company anticipates a 20.8% decrease in operating profit, despite expected record sales, and U.S. trade policies could reduce operating profit by 180 billion yen. Toyota's president Koji Sato expressed uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of the tariffs, stating the company will focus on developing products tailored to local customers, and the CFO indicated no immediate plans to pass the costs onto consumers.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the cause of the fire that shut down Heathrow Airport on March 21 "remains unknown." The fire at a nearby electrical substation led to a power outage, causing the airport to close to all flights, affecting hundreds of thousands of journeys worldwide. The National Energy System Operator's (Neso) final report is due by the end of June, and the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence of suspicious activity. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband ordered an urgent investigation to prevent future incidents, and Heathrow welcomed the interim findings, hoping the final report will provide answers.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has presented a somber outlook for the fiscal year, projecting a decline in operating profit by about one-fifth, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and a $1.3 billion hit from President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The company's chief executive, Koji Sato, noted the extreme flux in the auto industry, including trade relations, making it difficult to forecast beyond a two-month tariff impact. This forecast underscores the whiplash effect of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariff agenda on the auto industry, leaving global companies unable to estimate future prospects, particularly with the recent extension of tariffs to auto parts.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the deceased mystery novelist, is now "teaching" an online writing course through BBC Maestro, using a digital likeness created with AI. Academic researchers wrote a script using her writings and archival interviews, and an actor was fitted with an AI-generated ‚Äúdigital prosthetic.‚Äù The course coincides with debates about AI ethics, though Christie's family estate approved the project with the stipulation that it use her words and likeness. While creators reject the idea that this is a deepfake, ethicists raise concerns about posthumous consent and the potential for misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on trading partners. A senior British official confirmed the agreement, stating it would benefit both nations, though details remain unclear. The agreement could lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and remove taxes on U.S. technology companies. Trade experts suggest this may be a framework for negotiations rather than a finalized deal, with difficult issues such as tariff rates and digital trade yet to be addressed.</p>

          <p>Maersk, a major shipping company, reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit of $2.71 billion, but revised its 2025 global container market volume growth to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The company's CEO, Vincent Clerc, noted that the current level of U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. Despite keeping its 2025 profit guidance unchanged, Maersk is navigating a complex tariff landscape sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration's trade policies. Clerc emphasized that the issue is mostly a China-U.S. one and has not yet affected other trade lanes.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. This forecast comes as the company reported a drop in revenue and profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, which was largely expected as fans await the new console. The Switch 2 will start at $449.99 in the U.S. and has improved features compared with its predecessor. Nintendo launched the original Switch in 2017, which became its second-best-selling console ever, and the company delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. due to tariffs.</p>

It is uncertain if both sides will sign a finalized deal or a framework for an agreement.
