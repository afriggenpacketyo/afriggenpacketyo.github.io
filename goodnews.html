          <p>Japanese farmers and chefs are exploring the culinary potential of the prickly pear cactus, incorporating it into dishes like tempura, quiche, and pizza. The plant, long a staple in Latin America, is gaining recognition in Japan as a "superfood" rich in minerals and fiber, with a mild taste. Research from Chubu University suggests the cactus may have immune-boosting properties, further fueling its appeal. As climate change presents challenges to traditional agriculture, experts see the resilient and nutrient-packed cactus as a promising and sustainable food source for the future.</p>

          <p>Scientists are increasingly investigating bacteriophages, or "phages," as a way to combat drug-resistant bacteria. These viruses naturally prey on and kill specific bacteria, offering a potential alternative to antibiotics, which are becoming less effective. A BBC correspondent details a project where phages were collected from household sources, including a toilet, and successfully used in a lab to destroy bacteria from a patient's persistent infection. While phage therapy is a century-old concept, the rise of superbugs is reigniting research and development, with regulators beginning to establish pathways for its clinical use.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on its plan to cut disability benefits, following a significant rebellion from within its own party. The proposed changes, which aimed to save ¬£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), were criticized as a short-term cost-cutting measure rather than a genuine long-term reform. The reversal raises questions about the government's strategy and its ability to manage its large parliamentary majority. The compromise will spare current claimants from the cuts and involve disability charities in designing the new system for future applicants.</p>

The band ran through fan favorites like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It," showcasing their musical tightness.

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the fund to $750 million from $330 million. The measure, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to keep production in California and reverse the trend of projects moving to other states and countries with more generous credits. The move is a response to a significant decline in Los Angeles-based production and job losses in the state's entertainment sector. Industry unions and advocates have applauded the decision as a crucial step to bring production back home.</p>
