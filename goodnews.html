        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry's future. A recent bumper harvest in Spain has significantly lowered raw material prices by 50%, allowing the company to reduce shelf prices and stimulate consumer demand. This recovery follows a turbulent period marked by poor yields, extreme weather, and high inflation that caused prices to soar. The company now anticipates a more balanced market and plans to increase its investment in advertising to reinforce olive oil's status as a household staple.</p>

          <p>China reported unexpectedly strong trade figures for July, with exports growing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% year-over-year, beating economists' forecasts. This performance suggests resilience in the world's second-largest economy, largely driven by increased shipments to alternative markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. However, exports to the U.S. continued to decline for the fourth consecutive month amid ongoing trade tensions and the looming expiration of a tariff truce. The data provides a significant boost to China's economic outlook, though concerns remain about the sustainability of this momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese financial experts assert that the country is successfully managing its significant local government debt, which has long been considered a major risk to global financial stability. Through a comprehensive debt-restructuring campaign, authorities have extended repayment periods and brought overall risks under control. Some analysts now suggest that the U.S. federal debt situation is comparatively more alarming. China's approach has involved swapping high-interest 'hidden' debt for lower-interest, long-term bonds, a strategy facilitated by the central government's ability to intervene and support local government finances, a structure different from the U.S. system.

Wilmore, who logged 464 days in space, is one of the few astronauts to have flown on four different spacecraft: the Space Shuttle, Roscosmos Soyuz, Boeing Starliner, and SpaceX Dragon. His career included five spacewalks and significant contributions to validating systems for long-term human spaceflight. In a statement, Wilmore reflected on his lifelong curiosity and expressed that the magnificence of the cosmos mirrored the glory of its creator, a sentiment he carried throughout his missions.</p>

          <p>British athlete Jonathan Edwards expressed mixed feelings about his triple jump world record of 18.29 meters, which has remained unbroken for 30 years since he set it in 1995. While proud of his achievement, Edwards suggested that the record's longevity might not be a positive sign for the health of athletics, pointing to a decline in investment and participation in field events. He attributes his historic performance to a change in technique and his unique physical attributes. Despite advancements in sports science and footwear, no athlete has come closer than Christian Taylor's 18.21m jump a decade ago, leaving Edwards' remarkable feat unchallenged.</p>

          <p>An analysis from Sky News considers the possibility of progress in President Trump's long-standing promise to end the war in Ukraine. Recent comments from the White House suggest a potential meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin could be imminent, following what was described as 'great progress' in talks led by a U.S. special envoy. This development comes on day 198 of a presidency that began with a vow to resolve the conflict within 24 hours. While significant questions remain about Russia's willingness to agree to a ceasefire and meet with Ukrainian leaders, the shift in tone indicates a potential step toward fulfilling that ambitious campaign pledge.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Genes Linked to Human Intelligence May Also Drive Cancer</h2>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has identified 37 'de novo' genes, which are unique to humans and thought to contribute to our advanced cognitive abilities. These genes, which emerge from previously non-functional DNA, were found to be significantly more active in tumors. The research, published in Cell Genomics, suggests these unique genetic elements may act like 'dormant bombs,' playing a dual role in both human evolution and disease. The findings indicate that while these genes are key to what makes us human, their increased expression in cancerous tissues could also fuel tumor proliferation, offering a new avenue for cancer research.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game, a landmark moment for the sport. Her debut this weekend follows years of work in the minor leagues and spring training games. This achievement places her among a distinguished group of women who have broken officiating barriers in major men's professional sports. The article highlights other pioneers, including Sarah Thomas in the NFL, who was the first woman to officiate a Super Bowl, and Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner, who were hired as the NBA's first female referees in 1997, paving the way for greater inclusion.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study from Harvard Medical School suggests that lithium, a metal commonly used to treat mood disorders, may play a crucial role in brain health and protecting against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that lithium is naturally present in the body and essential for normal cell function. Experiments showed that depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain aging and the buildup of plaques associated with Alzheimer's, while maintaining normal levels was protective. The findings suggest that beta-amyloid plaques deplete available lithium in the brain, creating a downward spiral, and open a potential new avenue for developing treatments.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring from the agency less than five months after returning from a challenging and prolonged mission aboard the International Space Station. Wilmore co-piloted the inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner, which was plagued by thruster failures and gas leaks, extending his planned eight-day mission to over nine months. Despite the difficulties, Wilmore consistently maintained that the crew was prepared for the risks of a test flight and not 'stranded' in space. His 25-year NASA career was distinguished by service on multiple spacecraft, and his retirement follows a pattern set by other astronauts after completing historic test missions.</p>
