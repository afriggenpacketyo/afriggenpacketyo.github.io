          <p>Canada has withdrawn its planned 3% digital services tax on large technology companies, a move made to restart trade talks with the United States. The tax, which would have affected giants like Google and Amazon, was set to be collected but was rescinded after President Trump threatened to terminate all trade discussions, calling the policy an "egregious" attack. The decision was praised by U.S. officials and business groups, aiming to mend recent tensions and focus on a new economic partnership ahead of a July 21 deadline for new trade terms.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage clinical trial. These positive results are a crucial step for the company, potentially paving the way for regulatory approval of both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to file for approval later this year, hoping to enter a multibillion-dollar market.

          <p>The price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, is subject to constant fluctuation based on various market forces. As of June 27, 2025, the price stood at $3,272.56 per ounce, but this figure is influenced by factors including supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Geopolitical uncertainty, interest rates set by central banks, and the strength of the U.S. dollar also play significant roles in determining its value. Investors often turn to gold during times of economic instability, which can drive its price higher. (not investment advice)</p>

For decades, the question of his succession has been a point of tension with China, which views him as a separatist leader.

This preliminary data from Europe's largest economy could provide reassurance to the ECB that its monetary policy is effectively curbing price pressures across the eurozone. However, analysts note that service inflation remains elevated and that the disinflationary trend is partly driven by external factors, such as falling energy prices.

While the U.S. has often viewed its southern neighbors with condescension, Latin American nations have a long tradition of embedding collective social rights into their foundational principles, unlike the U.S. Constitution's focus on individual rights. From early anti-slavery movements to enshrining rights to healthcare and education, the region's focus on "the common good" offers a different model for democratic governance that prioritizes societal well-being.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Understanding how dogs experience the world requires recognizing that smell is their primary sense, according to dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz. Unlike humans, who are visual creatures, dogs construct their reality from olfactory information, mapping their environment and even perceiving the passage of time through changing scents. For dogs, smells are not simply good or bad but are crucial data points about their surroundings. This fundamental difference in perception means that while humans can form deep bonds with their pets, the inner world of a dog remains a delightful and complex mystery, shaped by a sense we barely utilize.</p>
