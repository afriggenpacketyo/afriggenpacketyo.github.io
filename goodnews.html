          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 09:20:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that a "framework" deal has been reached between the U.S. and China concerning the social media platform TikTok, with private parties agreeing on the commercial terms. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Friday to finalize this agreement. This significant development precedes a September 17 deadline for TikTok to divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown, stemming from congressional concerns over its "foreign adversary-controlled application" status. The proposed framework aims to transition TikTok to U.S.-controlled ownership, potentially resolving the long-standing national security debate surrounding the popular video-sharing app and its data handling.</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports to Semiannual Basis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 09:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that companies cease quarterly earnings reports in favor of semiannual disclosures, contingent on SEC approval. He contends this shift would reduce costs and enable corporate managers to prioritize long-term strategic planning, contrasting it with China's perceived longer-term business outlook. This suggestion aligns with past advocacy from prominent figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the short-term focus induced by quarterly guidance. Although current U.S. regulations mandate quarterly reporting, potential changes from the SEC or Congress could bring American practices closer to those in the UK and European Union, where semiannual reporting is common.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career experts are increasingly warning job seekers about common pitfalls when using AI tools for resumes and cover letters, despite their widespread adoption by approximately 65% of applicants. Jen DeLorenzo, a career coach, notes that AI can "hallucinate" false information or exaggerate experience, leading to difficult interview situations. Jessye Kass Karlin, a fractional recruiter, adds that AI-generated applications often lack the authentic voice and unique value employers seek, sometimes even including AI prompts inadvertently. Experts advise using AI to refine existing drafts rather than generating initial content, stressing the critical importance of human oversight and thorough proofreading to avoid errors that could jeopardize job prospects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive tactical analysis of Manchester City's dominant 3-0 win against Manchester United, dissecting how Pep Guardiola's strategies capitalized on United's defensive vulnerabilities. City effectively created overloads on their left flank and in central midfield, notably through Jeremy Doku's inward movement and Nico O'Reilly's wide positioning, which disrupted United's man-marking system. The analysis highlights United's disjointed pressing and the ineffectiveness of their "pinning" tactics, leaving City players free to advance the ball. The article concludes that United's ongoing struggles are rooted in structural and philosophical issues, rather than solely individual player performance, placing manager Ruben Amorim's steadfast adherence to his system under significant scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares surged after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a rare $1 billion purchase of the company's stock, his first open-market acquisition since February 2020. This significant insider buy on Friday was interpreted by traders as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, causing shares to climb 8% in premarket trading. The purchase comes ahead of a shareholder vote on a new, ambitious pay package for Musk, potentially worth $975 billion if he meets aggressive market value milestones. Analysts remain divided on Tesla's stock, but many are optimistic about its long-term potential, contingent on a successful transformation into an AI and robotics leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arthur Sze, a highly acclaimed author and translator, has been appointed as the new US poet laureate for a one-year term, succeeding Ada Limón. The 74-year-old's designation occurs during a period of considerable upheaval for the Library of Congress, following President Donald Trump's contentious dismissal of Librarian Carla Hayden. Sze, who has authored 12 poetry collections and received a lifetime achievement award from the library, accepted the position with a desire to "give something back to poetry." He intends to focus his tenure on promoting translation, a long-standing passion. His appointment is viewed as maintaining the laureate's mission to elevate poetry, despite the recent political scrutiny and leadership changes at the institution.</p>

          <p>This article emphasizes Africa's crucial position in the global critical minerals supply chain, highlighting their indispensable role in renewable energy and emerging technologies, and projecting a potential 12% boost to sub-Saharan Africa's GDP within 25 years. Nations like South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Ghana are identified as leading producers of vital minerals such as cobalt, platinum, and manganese. However, the article also critically examines the significant challenges, including adverse environmental impacts, the inequitable distribution of revenues, and conflicts exacerbated by mineral exploitation. It underscores the necessity for robust governance, transparency, and increased domestic refining capabilities for African countries to fully leverage their mineral wealth.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing political turmoil in Nepal, marked by the dissolution of parliament and impending general elections, experts do not foresee a significant impact on its relationship with China. Beijing's foreign ministry extended congratulations to Nepal's newly appointed chief justice, the first woman in the role, reiterating China's respect for Nepal's independent development trajectory. China also expressed its eagerness to advance exchanges and cooperation across diverse sectors, underscoring the enduring friendship between the two countries. This indicates that Nepal's internal political changes are not expected to destabilize its established diplomatic and economic ties with its influential northern neighbor.</p>

          <p>Convenience stores, particularly those emphasizing fresh food offerings, are increasingly capturing breakfast market share from traditional fast-food chains. Data shows that while fast-food morning traffic increased by a mere 1% over three months, visits to "food-forward" convenience stores, such as Wawa and Casey's General Store, surged by 9% in the same period. This trend is attributed to consumers prioritizing value amid rising menu prices and a challenging job market, alongside the broader selection and perceived affordability offered by c-stores. Even industry leaders like McDonald's acknowledge the breakfast segment as their weakest, prompting them to adjust strategies, including introducing value meals, to counter this growing competitive threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The year 2025 has proven to be an exceptional year for horror movies, with domestic box office earnings exceeding $1 billion for the first time since 2017, driven by successful titles like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners." This article examines the genre's significant resurgence, highlighting that horror films, historically known for their profitability due to low budgets, are now also garnering substantial critical appreciation, with some even considered contenders for major Oscar nominations. Experts attribute this success to a "swing toward respectability," noting a trend of creators transitioning from comedy backgrounds, who effectively utilize shared elements of timing and surprise. The genre's enduring appeal lies in its capacity to provide a safe, cathartic environment for audiences to explore themes of darkness and danger.</p>
