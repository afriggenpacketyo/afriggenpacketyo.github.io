          <p>President Trump concluded a five-day trip to Scotland by officially opening a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, largely centered around promoting his family's business interests, also included playing golf at his Turnberry resort and meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss a U.S.-EU trade framework. The new course, designed by his son Eric, adds to the Trump Organization's portfolio in Scotland. The trip has been characterized by its blend of official duties with personal business promotion, a recurring theme of his presidency.</p>

          <p>Jody Plauché, whose father Gary Plauché famously shot and killed his karate coach and abuser on live television in 1984, is reflecting on the sensational case. In a recent interview, Plauché, now 53, advises parents against taking the law into their own hands, noting his father "got lucky" to avoid a long prison sentence. He recalls his initial anger at his father for the killing, wanting the abuse to stop but not wanting his father to become a killer. Plauché, who has since worked as a sexual assault counselor, emphasizes the importance of parental support for survivors in their recovery journey.</p>

          <h2>Newcastle United Has Not Received a Bid for Striker Alexander Isak, Manager Confirms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:00:34 EDT</div>

          <p>Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has stated that the club has not yet received any formal offers for its top scorer, Alexander Isak. The 25-year-old Swedish striker, who is reportedly exploring a potential move, did not travel with the team for its pre-season tour, officially due to a minor injury. While Howe expressed his desire for Isak to stay, he acknowledged that the player's future is not entirely within his control. Isak, who joined Newcastle in 2022 for around £60 million, has been a prolific scorer for the club and still has three years remaining on his contract.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, one of the most popular celestial events, is set to peak on the night of August 11 and 12. Known for producing as many as 100 meteors per hour, including bright fireballs, this year's spectacle will be compromised by a bright waning gibbous moon. The moon's glare is expected to wash out many of the fainter meteors, significantly reducing the number visible to stargazers. Experts advise those determined to watch to find a location far from city lights and hope for an increased number of the larger, more brilliant fireballs.</p>

          <p>A new production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" at the Hollywood Bowl is generating buzz for its groundbreaking casting, featuring Cynthia Erivo, a Black woman, as Jesus and Adam Lambert, a gay man, as Judas. The creative team and cast believe the casting brings a new, transcendent dimension to the classic rock opera, reflecting contemporary conversations about power, identity, and civil rights. Staged as a bare-bones rock concert, the production aims to capture the raw energy of the original 1970 concept album. The sold-out show is seen as a powerful artistic statement in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>An El Segundo-based startup, Shinkei Systems, is using robotics and AI to automate the traditional Japanese fish-handling method known as ikejime. The company's "Poseidon" robot performs the technique, which is said to result in a more humane death for the fish and enhances its flavor, texture, and shelf life. By automating the labor-intensive process, Shinkei aims to make this higher-quality fish more widely available in the U.S. market, moving beyond high-end restaurants. The company, which recently raised $22 million in funding, hopes to improve both culinary standards and animal welfare in the fishing industry.</p>

Rebellions, which merged with rival Sapeon last year, is being positioned as a major domestic competitor to Nvidia, focusing on chips for AI inferencing. The company is collaborating with Samsung's foundry business to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip. This strategic partnership could bolster both Rebellions' global ambitions and Samsung's efforts to gain market share in the competitive chip manufacturing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Average rates for credit cards have hovered just above 20%, while auto loan rates have also been stable. Mortgage rates, which are more closely tied to 10-year Treasury yields, have fluctuated in a narrow band, indicating that the Fed's direct influence on some consumer costs is limited.
