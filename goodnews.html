          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced that second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, increased by 67%, although this was slightly below analyst forecasts. The company's overall sales and net profit were generally in line with expectations, but it reiterated a recently lowered full-year outlook. Novo Nordisk is facing pressures from increased U.S. competition, disappointing trial results for a new drug, and potential White House tariffs, prompting a new commitment to cut costs and sharpen its commercial focus under a new CEO.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 03:02:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how Premier League teams could strategically revolutionize throw-ins, a largely untapped aspect of modern football. Referencing the iconic long throws of Stoke City's Rory Delap, it questions why more teams haven't developed specialized throw-in tactics, especially since the set-piece is not subject to the offside rule. The analysis suggests that with dedicated training and a shift in mindset, throw-ins could be treated like corners, with complex set plays, decoy runs, and direct attacks on goal, transforming them from simple restarts into potent offensive weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant strategic shift, U.S. artificial intelligence firm OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b. CEO Sam Altman described the release as a major development, positioning the models as highly capable and usable alternatives in a field where Chinese companies have recently gained prominence with their own open-source offerings. This move marks a return to OpenAI's origins and is seen as a direct challenge to the growing global popularity of Chinese models, such as Alibaba's Qwen family, though analysts note China still leads in the quantity of available models.</p>

          <p>Progressive activist Katie Wilson and incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell have advanced to the November general election after securing the top two spots in Seattle's nonpartisan mayoral primary. Wilson, known for co-founding the Transit Riders Union, narrowly led Harrell in the initial vote count, setting up a competitive race for the city's leadership. The election pits Wilson's progressive platform, which includes a pledge to "Trump-proof" the city, against Harrell's more established, incumbent position, with both candidates having significantly outraised their primary opponents in campaign funds.</p>

The region was one of 12 province-level jurisdictions targeted by Beijing for excessive debt, which had previously forced it to halt major infrastructure projects like a subway system in the city of Baotou. This development, revealed in a local budget review, signals progress in China's broader campaign to restructure and control debt accumulated through local government financing vehicles.</p>

          <p>China is actively strengthening its coffee supply chains from Africa, driven by a combination of surging domestic demand and a zero-tariff policy for certain African nations. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this effort, signing agreements in top-producing countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to secure large quantities of beans and invest in local processing facilities. This strategic move allows China to lock in supplies amid global market uncertainties and cater to its rapidly growing coffee-consuming class, representing a significant shift in global coffee trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has expressed confidence that his drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will not have a major falling out as they compete for the Formula 1 championship. With Norris closing in on Piastri's lead, Brown acknowledged that while he expects them to race hard and even "swap paint again," their mutual respect and the team's transparent communication will prevent any serious conflict. Brown emphasized the importance of their healthy relationship for the team's long-term success, as both drivers are on long-term contracts and will be teammates for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy's performance provided a much-needed spark for the team, which had struggled offensively during his month-long absence due to a knee injury he initially feared was season-ending. His comeback, along with strong offensive contributions from Teoscar Hernández and others, suggests a potential turnaround for the Dodgers' recently slumping lineup as they head into the later part of the season.</p>

Under the proposed terms, ESPN would acquire the NFL Network and other assets like NFL Fantasy, while the league would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN. This deal would integrate the NFL Network into ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service and merge the fantasy football platforms, significantly strengthening ESPN's content offerings while giving the NFL a direct ownership share in the sports media giant.</p>

          <p>China is facing a shortage of available rockets, creating a potential bottleneck as it races to build satellite internet constellations to rival SpaceX's Starlink. This scarcity is highlighting a divide between national projects like Guo Wang, which has secured multiple recent launches on state-owned Long March rockets, and locally-backed initiatives like Shanghai's Qianfan. To keep its project on schedule, Qianfan is now turning to private rocket companies, issuing a large tender for seven launches to deploy 94 satellites by early next year, indicating a growing reliance on the commercial sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions, while the state will attempt to reassign the 1,200 staff members. The prison's site was originally a luxury resort, and local officials hope it may one day be restored to its former glory.</p>
