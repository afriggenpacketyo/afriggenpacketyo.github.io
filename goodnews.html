          <p>U.S. Steel shares have stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange after Japan's Nippon Steel finalized its acquisition of the company. Despite initial opposition from President Trump, who later announced a "partnership" between the companies, the deal proceeded under the original terms. The New York Stock Exchange has notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that U.S. Steel's shares will be removed from listing, effective June 30. U.S. Steel will continue to operate under its name but will be a subsidiary of Nippon Steel. The optimism score is based on the completion of the acquisition, suggesting stability in the steel industry.</p>

The Princess was last seen at the Order of the Garter service in Windsor, and her public appearances have been increasing recently. The tone of the article is sympathetic and understanding of her situation.</p>

Economists are concerned that Trump's aggressive trade policies are weighing on the economy. The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged as it wraps up a two-day meeting Wednesday.

          <p>The trailer for the new Bruce Springsteen biopic, *Deliver Me From Nowhere*, has been released, featuring Jeremy Allen White portraying The Boss during the recording of his album *Nebraska*. The film follows Springsteen as he records his sixth album, testing the patience of a record label who want a follow-up to his 1980 pop hit *Hungry Heart*. White studied hundreds of archive videos to capture Springsteen's mannerisms and voice. Fan reaction to the trailer has been cautiously optimistic, with praise for White's portrayal and the film's recreation of the *Nebraska* era. The anticipation for the biopic influences the optimism score.</p>
