          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Super Heavy-Starship rocket from its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, after two previous flights ended in upper-stage failures. This mission incorporated several upgrades aimed at improving the rocket's performance and reliability. The Super Heavy first stage successfully separated from the Starship and executed a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage is targeting a splashdown in the Indian Ocean after releasing eight dummy Starlink satellites to test the deployment system and conducting other in-space experiments. This rocket is critical for NASA's Artemis program and Elon Musk's plans for Mars colonization.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff secured a victory in the first round of the French Open, defeating Olivia Gadecki in straight sets, despite an initial setback of arriving without her rackets. Gauff jokingly blamed her coach for the mishap, explaining that he usually ensures her rackets are in her bag before matches due to superstition. Gauff's opponent, Gadecki, lightheartedly suggested that the incident might have been the key to Gauff's win. The American tennis star will advance to the second round to face Tereza Valentova.</p>
