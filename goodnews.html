        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times opinion piece discusses the identity crisis in country music, torn between Nashville's manufactured sound and the genre's recent diversification with Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and queer artists. The author argues that outsiders entering the genre must choose between reactionary whiteness or reparative multiracialism, highlighting artists like Jelly Roll, Morgan Wallen, and Zach Top as examples of industry-anointed white saviors. The piece also celebrates the rise of Black country artists and criticizes Nashville's aesthetic codes that exclude non-white performers, noting that Black audiences across the nation will pay for country music that reflects their cultural sensibilities.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic analyzes a Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Bad Bunny and Marcello Hern√°ndez, highlighting the cultural and linguistic nuances that may have been missed by non-Spanish speakers. The sketch cleverly plays on the stereotypes of macho Latino men, contrasting it with the actual vulnerability and shared experiences of the characters. The subtitles provided elided some of the nuances of the dialogue, and the article argues that the sketch's success lies in the gap between perception and reality.</p>

Nike had hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.

          <p>Max Verstappen won the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix after a compelling race with multiple caution periods and strategic battles. The caution periods led to a see-sawing battle between the McLaren drivers for second place. Norris was ahead after the VSC because Piastri stopped for fresh tyres to avoid being vulnerable to cars behind. The closing laps were compelling viewing, with the field alternating position between drivers on old tyres and those on fresh. Hamilton finished just 1.4 seconds behind Piastri at the flag.</p>
