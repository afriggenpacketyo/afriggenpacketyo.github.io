          <p>The US Air Force has commenced ground tests of new AI-driven combat drones, escalating its technological rivalry with China in the development of unmanned weapons systems. The YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A drones, created by General Atomics and Anduril, are the first unmanned aircraft to receive fighter designations in US military history. General David Allvin, the US Air Force chief of staff, highlighted the tests as a crucial step for the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program. This program signifies a strategic move towards autonomous aerial warfare, using uncrewed aircraft alongside crewed fighter jets to enhance combat capabilities. Relevant context: This development underscores the intensifying global race to innovate in military technology, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brood XIV, a group of periodical cicadas, is set to emerge across large portions of the eastern US after spending the last 17 years underground. These insects, which have missed significant global events, will surface around May and June, living only a few weeks to mate and lay eggs. The map provided offers a general idea of where Brood XIV will appear, with a more detailed version available from the University of Connecticut. This emergence is expected to shape ecosystems by providing a food source for various species, potentially increasing bird populations and altering hunting patterns, essentially rewiring forest food webs.</p>

          <p>King Charles III has unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, featuring the monarch in his regalia from the crowning ceremony, aiming for a more positive reception than his previous portrait. Alongside the King's portrait, a second official portrait of Queen Camilla by Paul Benney was also revealed, depicting her in her silk coronation dress. These portraits continue the tradition of coronation portraits, with immediate reactions to Kuhfeld's work being more favorable compared to the previous polarizing artwork. Both artists have longstanding professional relationships with the royal family, underscoring the personal connection behind these significant commissions.</p>

He believes the administration's rationale is "laughable" and sees his release as a "light of hope" for other detained student activists.

She emphasized that she will not remain silent if the UK government makes decisions that harm Welsh communities, using the analogy of the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey to illustrate that what is right for Essex may not be right for Barry. Morgan called for a halt to disability benefit cuts, a rethink of winter fuel allowance reductions, and increased benefits for Wales from wind power via the Crown Estate.</p>
