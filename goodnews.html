          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly developing a financial aid package potentially exceeding $10 billion to support U.S. farmers affected by trade disputes. The relief is particularly aimed at soybean farmers, who have been severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans, leaving silos full and crops unsold. A top White House economic adviser confirmed that "big measures" would be announced soon, suggesting that revenue from tariffs could be used to fund the assistance. This move aims to mitigate the economic fallout for a key political constituency as the harvest season proceeds without significant purchases from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli and Hamas delegations have begun indirect talks in Egypt to discuss a 20-point ceasefire plan proposed by President Trump. The plan aims to end the two-year war in Gaza by securing the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and establishing an international body to govern the territory. While Hamas has agreed to some key points, it has not consented to disarmament or its future political role. The negotiations represent a significant diplomatic effort to resolve the long-standing conflict, with hostage families expressing cautious hope for a resolution.</p>

The company has evolved since its initial filing, adding a cloud business to its large-scale chip production for training AI models. Feldman stated the withdrawal is in the best interest of stakeholders and will allow potential investors to better understand the business's current value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a continued push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable for over a year. Workers are engaging in forms of "passive resistance," such as "coffee badging"—appearing at the office for only a few hours—and "micro-shifting" their work schedules to maintain flexibility. Experts suggest this trend persists because middle managers are often reluctant to enforce strict attendance policies, and some companies may even be using RTO mandates as a way to reduce headcount without layoffs. This dynamic highlights the ongoing tension between employer demands for in-person work and employees' preference for flexibility.</p>
