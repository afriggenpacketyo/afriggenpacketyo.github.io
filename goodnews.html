          <p>Joseph Harris-Birtill, a two-year-old from the U.K., has become the youngest member of Mensa, an organization for individuals with IQs of 132 or higher. Joseph's mother noticed his exceptional abilities early on, including rolling over at five weeks, speaking his first word at seven months, and reading his first book at one and three-quarter years. He is now learning Morse code, knows the Greek alphabet, and is interested in the periodic table. His parents hope that Mensa will provide him with a supportive community and resources to nurture his intellectual growth, and they hope sharing his story will raise awareness about the unique needs of gifted children.</p>

          <p>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy criticized the Indiana Fever's response to the WNBA's investigation into alleged racist comments made toward the Chicago Sky during a recent game. The WNBA concluded that it could not substantiate the claims, leading Portnoy to accuse the Fever and the league of giving credibility to a troll and creating a racial war based on angry TikToks. Pacers Sports & Entertainment CEO Mel Raines released a statement appreciating the swift and thorough process undertaken by the WNBA, while reaffirming the commitment to providing a basketball experience where hate speech has absolutely no place. Portnoy believes the situation was a mismanagement of public relations.</p>

          <p>The Labour government in England is reviewing Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements for small housebuilders, which mandate compensation for nature loss on housing developments. The government is considering ways to reduce costs for smaller firms while still delivering habitats for wildlife, as part of a broader package of housing reforms. Proposed changes include easing BNG requirements for developments of up to nine homes and granting planning officers the power to approve them instead of councillors. Ministers also suggested exempting sites of between 10 and 49 homes from a tax to fund the removal of unsafe cladding, which may cause some to be at odds with the environment.</p>

The review found that suppliers "fell short of required standards" in the way they had treated customers, switching often vulnerable customers to paying upfront without their agreement.

          <p>A Japanese high court has ordered the Tokyo metropolitan government and the state to compensate a company president and others for an unlawful investigation into the alleged unauthorized export of goods capable of producing biological weapons. The Tokyo High Court ruled the investigation on Masaaki Okawara, president of machinery maker Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two other men was illegal. The court ordered the state and Tokyo to pay about 166 million yen in compensation, and the ruling acknowledged that the case was "fabricated" by the police. Prosecutors withdrew the indictment in July 2021, but one of the accused died before redeeming his honor.</p>
