          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, highlighting his administration's focus on changes to military academies, including the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. These changes included disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books on diversity and race from academy libraries, actions criticized by former West Point teachers who argue they stifle critical engagement with controversial ideas. Trump also dismissed boards of visitors, claiming the schools were infiltrated by leftist ideologies. Two protests were planned during the ceremony, one outside West Point's gate and another on the Hudson River, and Trump's health was questioned due to his slow walk down a ramp during his last visit in 2020.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck southeastern France, disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, with police investigating possible arson. The outage affected 160,000 households and followed a fire at an electrical substation. Authorities condemned the acts and mobilized resources to find the perpetrators. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d‚ÄôOr ceremony, would proceed as planned, with the Palais des Festivals switching to an independent power supply. Power was restored hours before the ceremony, around 3 p.m. local time, as music began blasting again from beachfront speakers.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul secured a decisive innings victory for England against Zimbabwe in their one-off Test match at Trent Bridge. Bashir's performance broke Zimbabwe's resistance, dismissing them for 255 in their second innings. Despite some loose bowling from England's seam attack, Sean Williams's 88 and Ben Curran's resilience provided some challenge. Harry Brook's spectacular catch at second slip to remove Wesley Madhevere was a highlight, and Bashir's achievement made him the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets.</p>

This recall follows a similar incident in March when Target recalled its store-brand baby food pouches for the same reason, and the CDC's childhood lead poisoning program was eliminated in April due to federal funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's death, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is implementing reforms to improve community relations and reduce crime. While shootings are trending down, violent crime rates have not improved as much as in other major cities. O'Hara focuses on restoring trust and pride within the department, adjusting arrest tactics, and enhancing community engagement. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of six police agencies, including Minneapolis, but O'Hara said reform efforts will continue despite the lack of federal oversight.</p>

          <p>ValueAct Capital has acquired a significant stake in Rocket Companies, a financial technology firm specializing in mortgage, real estate, and personal finance. The activist investor aims to leverage Rocket's technological leadership, particularly in artificial intelligence, to boost operational efficiency and market share. Despite Rocket's competitive advantages, its share price has lagged due to a small float and complex share structure. ValueAct's involvement and potential board representation are expected to attract long-term institutional investors and drive value creation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's return to West Point for a commencement address highlights the administration's stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, the academy faced calls for anti-racism training, but now complies with an executive order banning DEI programs. This includes disbanding cadet clubs formed around race and gender. The president's address comes after Vice President J.D. Vance emphasized a shift in foreign policy against open-ended conflicts, as well as the administration's shift in foreign policy against forever wars and open-ended conflicts.</p>

          <h2>Violent Crime Rates in the US Decline, Challenging Public Perception</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are declining significantly after a spike during the pandemic, but public perception often lags behind reality. The FBI's 2023 crime report shows a decrease in murders, and early data for 2025 suggests further declines. The pandemic's impact on schools, social services, and policing contributed to the initial increase in crime, but government interventions and the easing of pandemic restrictions have helped to reverse the trend. Despite the positive trends, a majority of Americans still believe crime is rising, highlighting a disconnect between perception and reality.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move, supported by Bill Ackman, could benefit investors and streamline the housing market. However, critics warn it could disrupt the market and increase mortgage rates. The plan involves releasing the firms from conservatorship and holding IPOs, with the government gradually selling its stakes. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the importance of maintaining stable mortgage rates during any transition.</p>

Trump's announcement, citing frustration with the pace of trade agreement progress, prompted a firm response from European politicians. The EU is prepared to defend its interests and engage in negotiations, but will not be pressured by unilateral actions. The EU is one of the US‚Äôs largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (‚Ç¨528bn; ¬£443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in underwater communication, enabling error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean. The feat, detailed in Acta Acustica, marks significant progress in long-range undersea messaging with profound civilian and military applications. The team developed a self-tuning system that can map signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography, which is critical for naval applications. The technology could be used to awaken dormant underwater drones or synchronize attack coordinates.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid weight gain of 40 pounds due to pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens, preventing it from fully opening. The condition, possibly triggered by a COVID-19 infection, led to swelling in his legs and abdomen, and doctors initially struggled to diagnose the cause. Open-heart surgery was required to remove the thickened pericardium, allowing Mauceri's heart to function properly again. Since recovering, Mauceri has returned to conducting and feels healthier than ever.</p>
