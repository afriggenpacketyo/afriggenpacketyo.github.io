          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable because existing shareholders are selling more shares (60%) than the company itself (40%), a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. While Circle did not comment on the reason for the decision, the company is profitable and has almost $850 million in cash and equivalents. The large proportion of insider sales may reflect venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns and a multiyear drought in IPOs. The company stands to raise another $240 million in the IPO, based on the midpoint of its expected range of $24 to $26 a share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, potentially salvaging vacuum-tube maglev systems. Researchers found that even minor imperfections in the track could cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride "pronounced, but not unpleasant." The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests for the study.</p>
