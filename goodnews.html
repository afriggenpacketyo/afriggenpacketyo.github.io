          <p>President Donald Trump pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. The Chrisleys, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of millions in fraudulent loans and tax evasion. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, expressed gratitude for Trump's intervention, stating that the pardon "literally came out of nowhere."

          <p>Global financial markets responded favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports, leading to gains in U.S. futures, oil prices, and the U.S. dollar. The court's decision, which found that Trump exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs, brought relief to investors after months of turmoil caused by the trade war. While the White House immediately appealed the ruling, the market's positive reaction reflects hopes that the worst of the trade-related disruptions may have passed. The ruling's long-term impact remains uncertain, but it has provided a brief respite for global commerce.</p>

          <p>English rugby is experiencing the end of an era as several prominent players, including Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs, and Alex Goode, are retiring from the game. These players, who were part of a fresh-looking England group that shocked the rugby world in 2012, have given a huge amount to the English game. The simultaneous departure of such a high-caliber group marks a significant shift, with younger players increasingly replacing established figures in squad dynamics. Danny Care also noted the mid-season retirements of Joe Marler and Anthony Watson, further emphasizing the changing landscape of English rugby.</p>

The government is including a legislative back-stop, which will allow it to push through the new rules, if insufficient progress is made by the end of the decade. As part of the voluntary agreement, known as the Mansion House accord, agreed earlier in May, the 17 firms involved committed to investing 10% of their assets in things other than publicly traded shares, so that more money would flow into homebuilding, infrastructure projects and start-up businesses in fast-growing sectors.

          <p>A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs. The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, rattled financial markets and raised the risk of higher prices and recession in the United States and around the world. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says the court's decision "throws the president‚Äôs trade policy into turmoil.‚Äù</p>
