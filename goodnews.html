          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase, along with versatile outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated these additions "raise the floor for our ballclub" by adding depth to the bullpen and lineup. Stewart, a former Dodger, has reinvented himself as a high-leverage reliever with increased velocity. The team hopes these new players will complement their existing roster as they aim for a strong finish to the season and a deep playoff run.</p>

          <p>At an internal town hall meeting, TikTok's parent company ByteDance disclosed that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. The disclosure was made by co-founder and CEO Liang Rubo to address online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. These figures suggest that ByteDance is a relatively stable employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture, even after the company shifted away from the infamous "996" schedule in 2021.</p>

While China's vice-minister of commerce suggested that a pause on new tariff increases would be extended, the Trump administration has not yet confirmed this and has been sending mixed signals about the status of the trade discussions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who could have lost their legal status and work authorization in the coming weeks. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was racially motivated and did not fully consider the lingering crises in their home countries. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>Free-agent wide receiver Keenan Allen is scheduled to meet with the Los Angeles Chargers to discuss a potential reunion with the team. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was the franchise's longest-tenured player before being traded to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap measure. The Chargers are reportedly in need of a veteran receiver after the unexpected retirement of Mike Williams at the start of training camp. A return would reunite Allen with quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he previously had significant success on the field, providing a known quantity to the receiving corps.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process, known as expedited removal, on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling could curtail a controversial practice of arresting migrants at their immigration court hearings for immediate deportation. Judge Jia Cobb stated the administration's policy was illegal and unfairly targeted individuals who had "played by the rules." The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, including many from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who were paroled into the country.</p>
