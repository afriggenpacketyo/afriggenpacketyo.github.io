          <p>The UK is experiencing a shift from extreme heat to milder temperatures with the arrival of wind and rain, according to the Met Office. After the hottest day of the year, with temperatures reaching 33.2C (91.8F), a weather front is expected to bring scattered showers and a wet end to the weekend. An amber heat health alert remains in place for England, warning of potential impacts on health and social care services. The week ahead is forecast to be unsettled with rain and sunshine, though eastern parts of England may still experience warm weather at times.</p>

          <p>Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp., has passed away at the age of 80. Smith revolutionized the express delivery industry, starting FedEx in 1973 to deliver small parcels and documents more quickly than the postal service. Over the next half-century, the Marine Corps veteran oversaw the growth of FedEx into a global transportation and logistics company. Smith stepped down as CEO in 2022 but remained executive chairman, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and economic impact.</p>

          <p>During MLB games, Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz and Seattle Mariners reliever Trent Thornton both experienced illnesses due to the intense heatwave affecting much of the United States. De La Cruz vomited on the field but continued playing, while Thornton was helped off the field. In addition, an umpire, Chad Whitson, also fell ill during the Seattle game and required treatment. The high temperatures prompted the Milwaukee Brewers' game at Minnesota to be played under an excessive heat warning.</p>
