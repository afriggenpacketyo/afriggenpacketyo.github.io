          <p>Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has publicly questioned team owner Jerry Jones's priorities following the trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons. Speaking on "The Rich Eisen Show," Aikman suggested that Jones seems to prioritize keeping the team in the news over winning championships. He referenced Jones's own comments about enjoying the drama and noted that the franchise's valuation and media attention have seemingly become the scoreboard instead of on-field success. Aikman acknowledged Jones's desire to win but pointed to the team's 30-year absence from a Super Bowl as a source of frustration.</p>

          <p>China's film market experienced a modest recovery this summer, with box office revenue reaching 11.96 billion yuan (US$5.5 billion), a slight increase of 2.76% year-on-year. However, these figures remain significantly below the record-breaking summer of 2023 and pre-pandemic levels, indicating persistent challenges for the industry. Despite a rapid expansion in the number of cinemas, demand has not kept up, making it difficult for many large-budget films to be profitable. In the first half of the year, only a small fraction of films managed to surpass 100 million yuan at the box office, highlighting the ongoing struggle to attract audiences back in large numbers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A historical review of California politics reveals a consistent pattern of extremely wealthy, self-funded candidates failing to win elections for governor or U.S. senator. Over the past 50 years, numerous high-profile figures like Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina have spent vast personal fortunes on their campaigns only to be defeated. Political strategists suggest this trend stems from a voter perception of an "empathy gap," where the ultra-rich are seen as unable to understand the daily lives of average citizens. While wealth provides the advantage of statewide name recognition through expensive advertising, it also creates a burden for candidates to prove they offer substantive solutions beyond their money.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry reflects on her career of creative reinvention, her DIY fashion philosophy, and the band's upcoming album, titled "High Noon." The style icon, who recently launched a clothing line, emphasizes the importance of experimentation and doing the "wrong" thing to achieve artistic success. She describes the new album as a traditional Blondie record in its eclectic mix of styles, including contributions from original Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock. Harry also discusses the evolution of music and technology, expressing that while AI may create technically proficient art, it lacks the essential human element of "soul" that comes from passion and life experience.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld's Fox News show "Gutfeld!" has become the most-watched program in late-night television, drawing over 3 million viewers nightly with its irreverent and conservative-leaning humor. The article suggests Gutfeld's success stems from providing an alternative to mainstream late-night shows, which he claims became focused on making audiences angry rather than happy. He credits the show's unpredictable panel and teasing dynamic, similar to his previous show "Red Eye," for creating a fun atmosphere that resonates with viewers. By deliberately avoiding the politically charged outrage common on other networks, Gutfeld has captured a large segment of the audience that felt alienated by mainstream culture.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson discusses her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," which chronicles her journey from a teenage prodigy to a resilient industry veteran. She credits her late mother and manager, Diane, for fiercely advocating for her to write and produce her own music at a time when young female artists were rarely given such control. Gibson sees her mother's efforts as having paved the way for today's empowered artists like Taylor Swift. The book details the pressures of early fame, including death threats and panic attacks, as well as her continued career on Broadway and her return to the Billboard charts, offering a candid look at a life lived in the public eye.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the emerging field of space medicine are working to overcome the significant physiological and psychological barriers that currently prevent long-duration human travel to Mars. The human body is ill-suited for space, where microgravity and radiation exposure can cause accelerated osteoporosis, muscle loss, and increased cancer risk. Research, such as NASA's twin study, has shown the profound effects of spaceflight on gene expression and overall health. As commercial space tourism increases, researchers hope to study a more diverse population to develop countermeasures, personalized medicine, and technologies like AI-assisted diagnostics, which could also yield significant medical benefits for people on Earth.</p>

          <p>As global water scarcity increases, desalination is becoming more common, but its primary environmental drawback is the disposal of highly salty, chemical-laden brine. However, experts argue that the environmental impact can be significantly reduced through proper management and new technologies. Strategies include diluting the brine with additional seawater before discharge and selecting plant locations with strong ocean currents to aid dispersal. Furthermore, innovative projects are exploring ways to treat brine as a resource by mining it for valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium, which reduces waste while creating additional economic value from the process.</p>

This acquisition adds to the fund's extensive global real estate portfolio, which already includes significant holdings in New York, Boston, and San Francisco, as well as major European cities.

          <p>Alphabet's stock increased by 6% after a U.S. judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google. The ruling means Google will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, removing a significant uncertainty for the company. While some restrictions were imposed, Google can still make payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine on their devices, though it cannot use exclusive contracts. Investors viewed the outcome as a major victory, allowing Google to maintain its core business structure as it continues to compete in the artificial intelligence space with its Gemini models.

          <p>Apple's share price saw a significant boost after a federal judge ruled that Google can continue its multi-billion dollar payments to be the default search engine on Apple's devices. While the landmark antitrust case found Google holds an illegal monopoly, the judge's remedies stopped short of banning these crucial payments, which are a major revenue source for Apple's services division. The decision removes a major financial risk for Apple, as the continuation of the deal ensures a steady stream of high-profit income. The ruling does, however, place new restrictions on Google, prohibiting exclusive contracts and limiting revenue-sharing agreements to one year, which may alter future negotiations.

          <p>China has launched a new seasonal shipping route to Europe, dubbed the "Arctic Express," which leverages melting Arctic ice to create a faster, more direct connection. The route utilizes the Northern Sea Route to connect major Chinese ports with destinations in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland, cutting transit time significantly compared to the traditional Suez Canal path. This strategic move aims to bypass geopolitical chokepoints, reduce shipping times for time-sensitive cargo, and avoid port congestion. The initiative underscores China's growing ambitions in the Arctic and its efforts to establish alternative trade corridors that could shift global shipping dynamics.</p>
