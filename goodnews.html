          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of contemporary China, characterizes the country as an "engineering state" due to its rapid development and focus on large-scale infrastructure projects. China's integrated transport systems, including subways and high-speed rail, are considered attractions in themselves, highlighting the nation's advancements in civil engineering. The country has built more dams, bridges, and high-rises than any other nation, showcasing its obsession with large public works. Wang contrasts this with the United States, which he terms the "lawyerly state," noting that China's STEM graduates outnumber those of the U.S. by a significant margin.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China During Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. Archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. The findings suggest that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. This study provides new insights into the history of animal domestication and early human societies in China.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made an albatross, also known as a double-eagle, during the first round of the US Open, marking just the fourth in the tournament's history since records began in 1983. Reed's shot was a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole, which bounced three times before rolling into the cup. Despite the exceptional score, Reed finished the day at 3-over 73, concluding with a triple bogey on the 18th hole. This albatross joins a short list of others achieved at the US Open by T.C. Chen, Shaun Micheel, and Nick Watney.</p>

          <p>Winnipeg Jets' Connor Hellebuyck won the Hart Trophy as the NHL MVP and the Vezina Trophy as the league‚Äôs best goaltender, marking the first time a goalie has achieved this double honor since Carey Price in 2015. Hellebuyck guided the Jets to the Presidents‚Äô Trophy for the best regular season and the William Jennings Trophy for allowing the fewest goals, although they lost in the second round of the playoffs. Nikita Kucherov of Tampa Bay, who led all scorers with 122 points, was awarded the Ted Lindsay Award as most outstanding player, as voted by his peers. Los Angeles captain Anze Kopitar won the Lady Byng for sportsmanship for a third time.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing to expand overseas to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tariffs, focusing on localizing production abroad. Although the U.S. and China reached a 90-day truce in their tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to tariffs of up to 3,521 percent. While most of the existing overseas capacity of Chinese solar manufacturers is in Southeast Asia, nearly 80 percent of their planned overseas capacity expansion is targeted for the Middle East and Africa, followed by the U.S. and Europe. Companies are preparing for the possibility of tariffs rising to 200 percent, which would make exports unfeasible.</p>

          <p>JJ Spaun leads the US Open at Oakmont after the first day, finishing four under par, while top-ranked players Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler faced challenges. McIlroy started well but faltered with a four-over 74, while Scheffler, the tournament favorite, is three over par after an uncharacteristically ragged round. Only 10 of the 156 players finished under par, highlighting the difficulty of Oakmont Country Club. Patrick Reed achieved a rare albatross on the par-five fourth hole but finished at three over par due to a triple-bogey on the last hole.</p>

          <h2>NHS to Offer World-First 'Trojan Horse' Cancer Therapy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:05:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy, which delivers toxic drugs inside cancer cells, to treat the blood cancer myeloma. The drug, belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt the cancer for nearly three times longer than current therapies and reduces side effects. The therapy works by binding a lethal chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, releasing its toxic payload once inside. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current treatments, and around 1,500 patients a year could benefit from the new drug.</p>
