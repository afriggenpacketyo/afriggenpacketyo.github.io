          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:51:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive on stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that captured animals be sterilized and immunized before release, unless they exhibit rabies or aggressive behavior. This new order also instructs municipal bodies to establish designated feeding zones and warns of legal action against violators. The court's decision follows a previous August 11 ruling to remove 5,000 dogs from "high-risk areas," which had sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists who deemed it illogical, impractical, and inhumane. This updated approach seeks to balance public safety concerns, given nearly 2,000 daily dog bite incidents in New Delhi, with the ethical treatment and welfare of the city's large stray dog population.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:39:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.1% in July, a slight decrease from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March but still surpassing economists' expectations of 3%. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, the lowest since November 2024. Notably, rice inflation showed signs of easing, decelerating to 90.7% after two months of more than doubling, contributing to the overall moderation. Despite this cooling, the 3.1% reading marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, prompting some experts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates, potentially impacting purchasing power.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morecambe FC has made history as the first professional English football club to be acquired by Sikh investors, Panjab Warriors, who aim to infuse the club with Sikh principles like discipline, trustfulness, and compassion. Concurrently, 30-year-old Ashvir Singh Johal was appointed as the first Sikh manager of a professional British club. This dual breakthrough is seen as a significant moment for Sikh representation in British football, inspiring the half-million Sikhs in the UK and millions globally who have historically been underrepresented in the sport. The new ownership hopes to attract a diverse fanbase and challenge the narrative that football ownership is an unethical process, setting a positive example for the community.</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after moving abroad, anticipating savings of £350 million over the next five years. Under the new policy, claimants residing outside the UK for more than eight weeks will generally no longer be eligible for the benefit, though exceptional circumstances allow for a longer period. A specialized team, expanded to over 200 investigators, will now utilize travel data to identify and stop payments to ineligible claimants. This initiative follows a successful pilot program that recovered £17 million in incorrectly paid benefits, aiming to reduce overall benefit overpayments and raise awareness of existing rules.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for faster development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) 2.0, emphasizing cooperation in agriculture, industry, and mining to enhance Pakistan's self-development and resilience. During a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif, Wang reiterated China's commitment as Pakistan's "most reliable partner" and pledged comprehensive support. Sharif, in turn, expressed interest in collaboration in aerospace, information technology, and infrastructure, while assuring China of Pakistan's full efforts to secure Chinese nationals and projects from terrorist attacks. CPEC, which has already seen over $65 billion in Chinese investment, including the Gwadar Port, is a crucial strategic and economic initiative for both nations.</p>

          <p>Adidas has issued a public apology to the Indigenous town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for culturally appropriating their traditional huarache sandal design. Executives from the German sportswear giant traveled to the community to personally deliver their remarks, admitting that their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe, created by Mexican American designer Willy Chavarria, closely resembled the local craft. The controversy gained national attention, with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum advocating for stronger protections against global brands copying traditional designs and emphasizing the need for compensation. Adidas pledged to collaborate with the town in the future, recognizing the community's reliance on handicrafts for its livelihood and the importance of respecting collective intellectual property.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction effectively winding down operations at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams prohibited further detainee transfers and construction, ordering the removal of temporary fencing, industrial lighting, generators, and waste receptacles from the site within 60 days. The ruling sided with environmental groups and a Native American Tribe, finding that the Trump administration and Florida officials violated the National Environmental Policy Act, risking irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration policies and a landmark victory for environmental protection and conservation efforts in Florida.</p>

Huang's comments, made during a visit to Taiwan, come as Nvidia reportedly asked suppliers to halt production of its China-bound H20 AI chips due to Beijing's security concerns. Despite the U.S. administration's interest in taking equity stakes in chip companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, a Wall Street Journal report clarified there are no plans for shares in firms expanding U.S. investments like TSMC. Huang also discussed Nvidia's plans for a new Taiwan office to support its growing workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

Honda similarly affirmed its ability to avoid direct tariff pass-through, attributing this to having many vehicles ranked high on Cars.com's American-Made Index.

          <p>The competition between the U.S. and China in space is intensifying, particularly concerning lunar exploration, as both nations accelerate their ambitions to land humans on the Moon. China has made significant advancements recently, including successful maiden take-off and descent tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and static firing tests of its Long March-10 carrier rocket, aiming to put cosmonauts on the Moon before 2030. This challenges NASA's Artemis program, which targets a U.S. astronaut return around 2027, despite facing delays and budget issues with its lander selections. Experts suggest China's rapid technological development and demonstrated mission capacity could potentially see it surpass NASA in this renewed space race.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been cleared of royal defamation (lese majeste) charges by a Bangkok court, narrowly avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence. Prosecutors had accused Thaksin of breaching the strict lese majeste law, which criminalizes criticism of the monarchy, with remarks made in a 2015 interview regarding the 2014 coup. His legal team successfully argued that his comments were misinterpreted, leading to a rare acquittal in such a case, as acquittals are uncommon in Thailand. This verdict significantly eases a major legal threat to Thaksin, who remains a central figure in Thai politics, and to his family's influential political movement, led by his daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.</p>

          <p>A new international study has uncovered a fascinating communication mechanism in corn plants, revealing they interact with neighbors by releasing linalool, a gas that prompts nearby plants to alter their soil environment. This discovery, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, offers crucial insights into plant-to-plant communication and its ecological implications. Researchers found that densely planted corn suffered less herbivore damage than those at the edges but also experienced reduced growth, suggesting a trade-off in defense and development. Optimizing the release of linalool could potentially be leveraged for improved pest control and increased crop yields, offering significant advancements for sustainable agricultural practices and food security.</p>
