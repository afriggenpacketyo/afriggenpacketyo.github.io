          <p>Korean Air announced a substantial deal to acquire 103 Boeing jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models, as part of its fleet modernization strategy amidst its merger with Asiana Airlines. This significant agreement was unveiled shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's meeting with US President Donald Trump, where trade discussions, including US tariffs on South Korea, were a key topic. The deal supports President Trump's initiative to encourage trading partners to increase business with American firms, and Boeing projects it will sustain approximately 135,000 jobs across the United States. This major purchase reflects a trend of countries making large Boeing orders during trade negotiations with the Trump administration, contributing to Boeing's competitive edge against Airbus despite recent crises.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have traded quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick, a move that surprised many expecting the Browns to carry four quarterbacks. This trade addresses the Raiders' urgent need for a backup after Aidan O’Connell's wrist injury, providing them with Pickett's 25 starts of NFL experience. Pickett, who previously played for the Steelers and Eagles, was competing for a backup spot in Cleveland behind Joe Flacco, alongside rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. His hamstring injury during training camp hindered his competition, leaving the Browns' backup quarterback situation uncertain as the roster deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again scrubbed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad, following an earlier scrub due to an oxygen leak. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades after three prior catastrophic failures, with a potential third launch attempt on Tuesday. A successful flight is crucial for accelerating SpaceX's launch cadence and advancing its autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfer technology, vital for NASA's 2027 moon landing goal and eventual Mars missions. Despite thousands of engineering challenges, SpaceX founder Elon Musk and NASA's acting administrator remain optimistic about achieving these ambitious goals.</p>

The initiative covers both student and teacher training, offering flexibility for schools to integrate AI content into subjects like information technology and science or deliver it as concentrated lessons. Students in early primary grades will be introduced to everyday AI applications and responsible technology use, including privacy. This move aims to foster advanced studies and hands-on experience in AI, ensuring a skilled future workforce.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to US schools, reversing an abrupt freeze after a multi-state lawsuit led by California's Attorney General. The funds, designated for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-learner support, were withheld without clear explanation, though a White House spokesperson cited concerns about "radical left-wing agenda" misuse. States argued the impoundment was illegal, violating Congress's power to appropriate funds. This restoration is crucial for programs serving 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families, and marks a win against the administration's attempts to reshape public education based on its political beliefs.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian federal judge has granted an injunction, temporarily suspending an antitrust watchdog's order to halt the "soy moratorium," a two-decade-old private pact protecting the Amazon rainforest. The moratorium bars soy traders from purchasing from farmers who cleared Amazon land after July 2008. The antitrust watchdog, CADE, had previously ordered the suspension, citing concerns about commercially sensitive information sharing, a decision criticized by environmental groups and Brazil's Environmental Ministry. The judge sided with Abiove, a lobby representing oilseed crushers, ruling to maintain the moratorium until a full CADE panel makes a final decision on Abiove's appeal, highlighting ongoing tensions between environmental protection and agricultural interests.

No injuries were reported, but officials are warning of potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway, encouraging commuters to seek alternative routes. This fire occurs amidst a 10.2-mile repavement project on the 405, which includes a series of overnight road and lane closures, further impacting local traffic.</p>

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the parasitic infestation of fly larvae, or myiasis, on August 4, noting the risk to US public health is currently "very low." New World Screwworm flies lay eggs in open wounds, with larvae feeding on live tissue, causing serious damage to animals and, rarely, humans. This confirmation follows an advisory for South Texas after the parasite was found in Mexico, prompting US government initiatives to prevent its spread in animal imports.</p>

State Senator Dave Cortese emphasized the need for consistent funding to continue the project, which has already created nearly 15,000 jobs and generated $22 billion in economic growth. The project, billions over budget and decades behind schedule, faces challenges including the Trump administration's withdrawal of $4 billion in funding. While leaders aim to complete the Merced-Bakersfield segment by 2033, the High-Speed Rail Authority stresses that long-term financial commitments are crucial for the project's overall viability and future expansion.

          <p>Conventional wisdom about posture, often emphasizing rigid upright sitting, is outdated and potentially harmful, according to Dr. Xand van Tulleken. He suggests three key rules for better back health: prioritize continuous movement rather than static positions, build core and back strength through regular exercises like pilates or yoga, and cultivate a healthy mindset. Dr. Xand explains that back pain is not solely muscular but also emotional and psychological, influenced by stress and work-life balance. Therefore, addressing posture effectively involves dynamic physical activity, strengthening, and managing mental well-being, rather than relying solely on ergonomic gadgets or fixed positions.</p>
