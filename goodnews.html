          <p>Two New Orleans high school seniors, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, achieved a mathematical breakthrough by independently developing a trigonometry-based proof for the Pythagorean Theorem, a feat previously thought impossible for 2,000 years. Their innovative work, which included Calcea's "Waffle Cone" method, was presented at an American Mathematical Society conference and gained international recognition. This article celebrates their remarkable accomplishment, highlighting the supportive environment of their all-girls Catholic school, St. Mary's Academy, which fosters a belief in boundless possibilities for its students. Despite their brilliance, both students plan to pursue careers outside of pure mathematics.</p>

          <p>St. Mary's Academy, a Catholic school for young Black women in New Orleans, stands as a beacon of empowerment, famously educating students like Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, who recently proved the Pythagorean Theorem. This article delves into the school's inspiring origins, founded in 1867 by the Sisters of the Holy Family, an order established by Creole nun Henriette Delille who defied anti-literacy laws to educate non-White people. Despite facing destruction from Hurricane Katrina, the school rebuilt and maintains a 100% graduation and college admission rate, continuing Delille's vision of fostering spiritual and intellectual growth for its exceptional students.</p>
