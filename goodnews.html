          <h2>Expert Analysis on Optimal Timing for Claiming Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 13:26:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complexities of deciding when to claim Social Security benefits, weighing the pros and cons of different ages. Claiming at 62 results in a permanently reduced monthly payment, while waiting until full retirement age (66-67) provides the standard benefit. Delaying until age 70 can significantly boost payments by about 8% annually, offering a larger guaranteed income for those who can afford to wait. The best choice ultimately depends on individual financial needs, health, and other retirement income sources, with strategies like using annuities or 401(k) funds to bridge the gap.

          <p>Chelsea has secured a club-record deal, valued at just under £1 million, to sign 20-year-old American forward Alyssa Thompson from Angel City. Thompson, a highly-regarded talent on the global stage, has completed her medical and is set to sign a five-year contract. This transfer surpasses Chelsea's previous record for signing defender Naomi Girma but does not break the Women's Super League record. The signing is a significant boost for Chelsea's attack, which has recently been weakened by injuries to key players Mayra Ramirez and Lauren James.</p>

The event highlights the complex but often close relationship between the Trump administration and the tech sector, as many of the invited leaders have previously collaborated with the administration on its technology and economic goals.</p>

          <p>Ford's redesigned, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up 53.7% year-over-year, marking the vehicle's best performance in 21 years. This growth in a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle provides a bright spot for the automaker, even as the industry sees increased demand for electric vehicles. While EVs make up a growing part of Ford's business, the success of the large, profitable Expedition indicates strong continued consumer interest in traditional SUVs. This trend aligns with Ford's strategy of prioritizing hybrid models alongside its all-electric offerings.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated launch of the video game 'Hollow Knight: Silksong' led to widespread technical issues as major online retailers struggled to handle the massive influx of buyers. Platforms like Steam, as well as the Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox stores, experienced errors and outages on Thursday, frustrating thousands of gamers trying to purchase the sequel. The original 'Hollow Knight,' released in 2017, has sold over 15 million copies, fueling immense excitement for its successor. Despite the purchasing difficulties, Steam reported that over 100,000 people were playing the game within 30 minutes of its release.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, 'The Conjuring of America,' examines the historical and cultural significance of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved people in the United States. The book arrives as conjure gains visibility in popular culture, from films like 'Sinners' to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' Stewart argues that the conjure woman's influence is deeply embedded in American life, visible in traditions like eating black-eyed peas for New Year's, the lyrical themes of the blues, and even the origins of denim. The book traces how Black women, through these practices, shaped the nation's approaches to medicine, childbirth, and community care.</p>

The average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also decreased, falling to 5.6%.
