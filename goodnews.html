          <p>Hezbollah's losses in a conflict with Israel have weakened Iran's power and influence in the Middle East, according to analysts. A Mossad operation involving explosive pagers and subsequent Israeli airstrikes led to the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and other key commanders. This resulted in a ceasefire and a significant degradation of Hezbollah's capabilities. The proxy war strategy that Iran has pursued with Hezbollah for decades is now seen as failing, impacting Iran's ability to project its influence in the region. The weakening of Hezbollah and the loss of key allies in Syria have created a challenging environment for Iran's regional ambitions.</p>
