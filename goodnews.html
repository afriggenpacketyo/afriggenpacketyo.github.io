          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will not be running for the Georgia Senate seat in the upcoming election, citing her dissatisfaction with Senate Republicans. Greene, known for her strong allegiance to Trump and her controversial views, stated she would not "fight for a team that refuses to win." This decision comes after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp also declined to run, leaving the Republican primary field open. The Georgia Senate race is crucial for both parties as they seek to control the chamber, with recent elections in the state being closely contested.</p>

          <p>A new BBC drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, explores the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing and its impact on victim response protocols. The article highlights how the experiences of the victims' families, particularly their struggle to receive timely notifications and information, led to significant improvements in how victims were treated following the 9/11 attacks. The families' activism resulted in the creation of victim services within the FBI and the Department of Justice, as well as reforms in airline procedures for dealing with victims and their families. The drama emphasizes the importance of compassion and collaboration in the face of tragedy.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, a case involving allegations of sexual harassment and defamation. Swift's spokesperson claims the subpoena is a publicity stunt designed to draw attention to the case, asserting Swift had minimal involvement with the film "It Ends with Us," only permitting the use of her song. Lively sued Baldoni for sexual harassment, which he denies, and Baldoni countersued Lively for defamation. The judge has indicated the lawsuits will likely be combined into one trial in March 2026.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan indicates that approximately 39% of the population experiences feelings of loneliness, a figure that has remained relatively consistent since 2021. The survey, which included over 20,000 participants, explored the relationship between loneliness and smartphone usage, revealing a higher prevalence of loneliness among those using smartphones for extended periods. Factors contributing to loneliness include bereavement, living alone, changing jobs or schools, and health issues.

Experts predict the re-entry will occur, but the exact location of impact remains unknown, though it will be between 52 degrees north and south latitude. The spacecraft is equipped with a heat shield, increasing the likelihood that parts of it will survive the re-entry and reach the surface.</p>
