          <p>Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is poised to become the next president of the UN General Assembly, running unopposed for the one-year position.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist backed by Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidential election in a close race against Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. This outcome raises concerns about Poland's alignment with the EU and Ukraine, as Nawrocki has expressed Eurosceptic views and criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. While the president's role is secondary to parliament, Nawrocki's veto power could hinder Prime Minister Tusk's pro-EU government, especially regarding reforms and EU fund access. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation with Poland. The election result highlights deep divisions within Poland and raises questions about its future direction.</p>
