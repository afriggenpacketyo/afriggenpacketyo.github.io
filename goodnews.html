Nursing students are trained as "Birth Companions" to offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor, acting as advocates for patients. The initiative is further supported by a new Maryland law requiring hospitals to accommodate certified doulas, enhancing accessibility for mothers seeking a more supportive birth experience and improving maternal care outcomes in the community.</p>

This article outlines three personalized approaches to tackle overwhelming debt, moving beyond generic advice. These strategies include consulting with a credit counselor for a comprehensive financial plan, working with a debt relief expert to negotiate lower balances directly with creditors, and proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or temporary rate reductions.

          <p>Following a soft August jobs report, financial markets are pricing in a high probability of the Federal Reserve cutting its key interest rate. While a quarter-point reduction is the most likely scenario, traders are leaving open a small chance for a more aggressive half-point cut to stimulate the economy. The central bank faces a complex decision as it balances a weakening labor market against inflation that remains above its target, with upcoming inflation data expected to heavily influence the final outcome.

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is offering a significant financial incentive to encourage water conservation ahead of a new state law. Businesses, schools, and public institutions can now receive a rebate of $7 per square foot for replacing nonfunctional turf with drought-tolerant, sustainable landscapes. This initiative, funded by state and federal grants, aims to beautify properties while drastically reducing potable water usage for irrigation, which will be prohibited for such lawns starting in 2027 for public entities.</p>

          <p>The disaster-relief charity FireAid, founded by Steve Ballmer, has released two audit reports confirming that funds raised for wildfire victims were distributed according to its mission. The reviews, one of which was conducted by the law firm Latham & Watkins, found no evidence of misrepresentation, improper grantee selection, or misappropriation of the nearly $100 million raised. The reports were commissioned after the charity faced scrutiny from Republican politicians and some residents, and they affirm that aid is effectively reaching affected communities through established nonprofit organizations.</p>

          <p>Winning tickets for the second-largest Powerball jackpot in history, worth $1.787 billion, were sold in Missouri and Texas. Each ticket holder will split the prize, with a choice between a pretax lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million. However, the ultimate take-home amount will differ significantly due to state tax laws; the Texas winner will face no state income tax on their winnings, while the Missouri winner will be subject to state taxes, potentially reducing their payout by millions of dollars.

          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts advise that potential homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, which directly impacts the interest rate lenders will offer. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can lead to a lower rate and avoid the need for private mortgage insurance, resulting in significant long-term savings.
