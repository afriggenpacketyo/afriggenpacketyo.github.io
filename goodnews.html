          <p>Maria Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her persistent efforts to promote democracy and a peaceful transition of power in her country. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as a "brave and committed champion of peace" who has unified a once-divided opposition despite facing serious personal threats. Machado, who has been in hiding, expressed shock and dedicated the award to the Venezuelan people's struggle for freedom. The recognition highlights the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela under the autocratic rule of Nicolas Maduro.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India are deepening their partnership, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit resulting in agreements on trade, defense, and technology. The two nations are moving to ratify a trade agreement that will significantly reduce tariffs on goods like cars and whiskey, potentially boosting two-way trade by $34 billion by 2040. This strengthening of ties is seen as a strategic response to the Trump administration's high tariffs on Indian goods, providing India with alternative market access. The deal also includes a multimillion-dollar defense agreement for Britain to supply military hardware to India.</p>

          <p>Costco has successfully built a nearly $10 billion apparel business, surpassing the annual sales of major clothing retailers like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's strategy involves offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label, often through direct manufacturing partnerships and opportunistic bulk purchases. This creates a "treasure hunt" shopping experience that appeals to its members. Despite its limited selection compared to traditional retailers, Costco's significant growth in this sector has drawn the attention of competitors, as evidenced by a recent lawsuit from Lululemon.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Highlights Common Investing Mistake Among Young People</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the biggest investment mistake young people make is being overly cautious and worrying more about potential losses than long-term gains. He advises that young investors, who have the significant advantage of time, should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding cash or bonds. Historically, stocks have outperformed other assets over long periods, making them crucial for building wealth. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds to build a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of locking in current high rates. While national average yields for one-year CDs are around 1.97%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some exceeding 4.25% for one-year terms. The article notes an "inverted yield curve" phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones. Savers are advised to compare rates, particularly from online banks which have more competitive offers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation. This annual change is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income has not increased. For 2026, the standard deduction will be $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. These adjustments mean Americans will need to earn more before moving into a higher tax rate, potentially providing some financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as player-manager for Barnet FC from 2012. His tenure was marked by contrasts: brilliant on-field performances, demanding a formal address of 'Mister' from players, wearing the number one jersey, and controversially skipping some away games. Davids joined the struggling club without pay, aiming to gain coaching experience while still playing at age 39. Despite almost saving the team from relegation, his time ended after 15 months, leaving behind a unique chapter in the club's history.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a former participant on "House Hunters Renovation" reveals the stark contrast between her polished on-screen life and the reality of her crumbling marriage. While the show portrayed her and her wife as a carefree couple renovating their home, they were secretly struggling as foster parents to two young boys who couldn't be shown on camera. The immense pressure of the renovation, filming, and the uncertainty of the foster care system pushed their relationship to the brink, leading them to couples counseling.
