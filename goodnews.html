          <h2>NATO Allies Agree to Increased Defense Spending Target</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies have committed to significantly increase their defense spending, more than doubling the previous target to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. This decision, formalized in a joint declaration, underscores the alliance's unified stance against security threats, particularly from Russia and terrorism. The 5% target includes a minimum of 3.5% for core defense spending, with the remainder allocated to security and defense-related critical infrastructure, aiming to bolster civil preparedness, innovation, and the defense industrial base. Member states will be required to submit annual plans demonstrating their progress towards achieving this goal, addressing prior concerns about some nations not meeting the existing 2% target. This move is intended to reassure allies of the U.S.' commitment to Article 5. The optimism score is 80.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to purchase at least 12 new US-made F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, marking a significant strengthening of the nation's nuclear posture. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced at the NATO summit in The Hague that these jets will join NATO's airborne nuclear mission, responding to a growing nuclear threat. While the F-35A jets can also carry conventional weapons, their ability to be equipped with US-made nuclear bombs underscores the UK's commitment to collective defense within NATO. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, which highlighted new nuclear risks, and aligns with a national security strategy emphasizing preparedness for potential direct threats to the UK homeland.

          <p>An 18th-century shipwreck was discovered by chance in Dubrovnik's old port, near the city's medieval stone walls, a well-known filming location for HBO's "Game of Thrones". Ivan Bukelic, while working on a water pipeline, found the wooden structure buried in the seabed less than three feet below the surface. Marine archaeologist Irena Radiƒá Rossi confirmed the vessel dates back to the late 18th century based on radiocarbon analysis, and plans are underway to protect it for future research. Dubrovnik, a UNESCO-protected heritage site and key trade port in the Adriatic Sea during medieval times, attracts numerous tourists and holds significant historical value.

          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and military conflicts, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increasing slightly to 6.88%. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), rates have remained within a narrow range around 7% since early April, providing little incentive for homebuyers due to inflated house prices and low inventory. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped slightly, and while purchase demand is higher than last year, it remains historically low. Applications to refinance a home loan saw a modest increase, but overall volumes remain low. The optimism score is 65. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory after leading in the first round of voting, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo conceding the race. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters, while Cuomo, seeking a political comeback, ran on a message of experience and standing up to President Trump. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, as no candidate reached the 50% threshold, with final results expected in July. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the general election in November, although incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent.

          <p>England's cricket team, led by Ben Stokes, has been rewriting the rules of Test cricket with their supreme run chases, showcasing a fearless and positive approach. The team's success is attributed to the fantastic vibe created by Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, allowing players to perform with a smile and a sense of freedom. Despite the thrill of the chase, there's room for improvement, particularly in England's bowling attack and the performance of off-spinner Shoaib Bashir. Former England captain Michael Vaughan highlighted the importance of a solid top seven for success in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump brokered a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, marking a pause in military confrontation, though a barrage of Iranian missile fire followed the announcement. John Spencer, executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, noted that delayed implementation is not unusual and described the U.S. operation as historic. He cited five historical precedents, including the Korean War Armistice and the Yom Kippur War Ceasefire, marked by delayed activation, phased goals, and a final window for military positioning. Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold, describing it as "an off-ramp" for both sides and establishing a new doctrine with Israel's ability to dominate Iranian skies and the U.S. response to nuclear proliferation threats. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and made their way to the food store, where they devoured a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park emphasized that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The experienced keeping team used recall training to encourage the bears back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error" as the cause. The optimism score is 90.</p>

          <p>Louisiana secured Meta's massive $10 billion data center project by offering significant incentives, including a 20-year sales tax exemption, to meet Meta's requirements. The project, set to be the largest data center in the Western Hemisphere, is expected to transform Louisiana's economy by creating 500 permanent jobs and thousands of construction jobs. Meta chose Louisiana due to its ability to provide a large, shovel-ready site with access to the necessary infrastructure and energy. The project involves constructing three gas-fired power plants at a cost of over $3 billion to meet the data center's electricity needs. The optimism score is 75.</p>

The next step is to boost defense industries among the allies to meet new challenges. The optimism score is 80.</p>
