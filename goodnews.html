          <p>U.S. steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the potential for mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with a broader national strategy to reduce American dependence on China for these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing electric vehicles, semiconductors, and advanced weapons systems. Following the announcement and a statement from CEO Lourenco Goncalves, the company's shares surged significantly as investors speculate on potential government support similar to deals made with other domestic producers.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the requirements for filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, often referred to as liquidation bankruptcy. The primary obstacle for applicants is the "means test," which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with incomes below the median typically qualify easily, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The process also involves credit counseling and a review of recent financial activities to prevent system abuse, with Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement offered as alternatives for those who are denied.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock price rose nearly 3% following a report from Counterpoint research indicating robust early sales for the new iPhone 17 series in the United States and China. Within the first ten days of availability, sales of the latest model have reportedly outpaced the previous iPhone 16 series by 14%. The base model iPhone 17 is highlighted as particularly compelling for consumers due to its upgraded features at the same price point as last year's model. In response to the strong demand, Loop Capital upgraded Apple's stock from hold to buy and significantly raised its price target.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman has won a decisive victory in the Turkish Cypriot leadership election, securing 62.8% of the vote against the incumbent Ersin Tatar. Erhurman, a moderate supported by left-wing parties, campaigned on a platform of resuming reunification talks for Cyprus based on a federal solution, a departure from the two-state policy favored by Tatar and Turkey. His victory is seen as a message from the Turkish Cypriot community rejecting external interference and reaffirming its secular identity. The election result has been welcomed by Greek Cypriot leaders, raising hopes for the resumption of long-stalled peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, stated on Monday that he anticipates the ongoing government shutdown is "likely to end sometime this week." He suggested that moderate Democrats might soon break the partisan impasse over federal funding priorities, which centers on Republican opposition to extending enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett also warned that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown has entered its third week with no clear resolution in sight as both parties continue to blame each other for the lapse in funding.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 10:36:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to recent market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds that utilize options-based strategies. He argues that these funds offer a more reliable form of downside protection because their performance is not directly correlated with traditional asset classes like stocks. This approach can also provide an income stream that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is increasingly important as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates. Burrello advises investors to look for ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be wary of funds with unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual "Carrie Bradshaw Index," which ranks U.S. cities based on the affordability of living alone in a studio apartment. The index uses the 30% rule, where rent should not exceed 30% of gross income, to determine the necessary salary. Wichita, Kansas, tops the list as the most affordable city, where the median wage is 75% higher than what is needed to rent a studio. The report notes that several cities, particularly in Texas, have become unaffordable compared to last year, likely due to an influx of new residents driving up rent prices.</p>

Following Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statement about setting a price floor for rare earths to combat Chinese market manipulation, investors are speculating on which firms might receive government backing.

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato," is facing a new federal indictment that could make him eligible for the death penalty. The charges stem from the 2013 murder of Juan Jesus Guerrero Chapa in a Southlake, Texas, shopping center. Prosecutors allege Villareal-Hernandez orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot as revenge against a rival cartel he held responsible for his father's death. After years as one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, he was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S. earlier this year to face justice.</p>

For decades, China's economy has relied on exports and infrastructure, but with those sectors slowing, boosting consumer spending has become urgent. However, analysts believe Beijing will prioritize government spending on developing high-tech industries, like advanced semiconductors, to achieve technological sovereignty and counter geopolitical pressure from the U.S. This focus on industrial strength may leave fewer resources available to address the gloomy mood among Chinese consumers and households.</p>
