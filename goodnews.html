          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that President Trump's tariff policies were the primary reason the central bank did not cut interest rates earlier. This admission directly links the administration's trade policy to the Fed's monetary decisions, highlighting the economic uncertainty it created. The article provides context on the ongoing pressure from the White House for rate cuts and reinforces the Fed's stated position of making decisions based on incoming economic data. Powell also deflected questions about his future at the Fed amid public criticism from the president.</p>

          <p>A key provision within the Senate Republican spending package would permanently increase the maximum child tax credit to $2,200 and subsequently index it to inflation. This article details the proposal, contrasting it with the House version and explaining the current rules, including income-based phase-outs. As part of the broader "big, beautiful bill," this change aims to provide financial relief to families. However, policy experts note that due to the credit's partial refundability structure, the lowest-income families may not be able to access the full benefit from the proposed increase.</p>

          <p>This article outlines several ways homeowners can strategically use their home equity, which has grown significantly due to rising property values. With interest rates on credit cards at record highs, using a lower-rate home equity loan or HELOC is presented as a more affordable borrowing option. The suggestions include consolidating high-interest debt, funding home renovations that increase resale value, and investing in a diversified portfolio. The piece also mentions financing a small business or education, but consistently cautions that these strategies involve risk as the loan is secured by the owner's home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's plan for mass layoffs and a sweeping reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The ruling, stemming from a lawsuit by 19 states, found "no rational basis" for the plan and warned of "devastating consequences" to public health. The decision halts the termination of approximately 10,000 employees and the restructuring of key agencies like the CDC and FDA, with the judge stating that the executive branch overstepped its authority in attempting such wholesale changes without congressional approval.</p>

The removal of the surcharge by the popular 24-hour diner chain, which serves over 270 million eggs a year, indicates that egg prices are beginning to stabilize and return to more normal levels, offering a small measure of financial relief.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes credit card debt forgiveness as a potential solution for consumers struggling with high-interest debt. While these programs can reduce a borrower's total debt by 30% to 50%, they are typically only available to those demonstrating significant financial hardship and can have a lasting negative impact on one's credit score. The piece advises that forgiveness is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It suggests that individuals should first explore all alternative debt relief options, such as nonprofit credit counseling or debt consolidation loans, before committing to a forgiveness plan.
