          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 18:40:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a significant slump in July, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly exploring options to acquire an impact position player before the trade deadline, with a focus on improving their outfield defense. While the team's superstar hitters have struggled, their defensive vulnerabilities have also become a concern, particularly with a strong starting rotation expected for the playoffs. Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader has emerged as a potential target, valued for his premium defensive skills and solid offensive production this season. The move would aim to bolster the team's run-prevention capabilities to better support their pitching staff in a potential championship run.</p>

          <p>Following his death, Hulk Hogan's legal victory against Gawker Media is being remembered as a pivotal moment in the conflict between First Amendment rights and personal privacy. In 2016, Hogan successfully sued the gossip site for publishing a surreptitiously recorded sex tape, resulting in a $140 million verdict that bankrupted the company. While the case did not set new legal precedent, it served as a powerful warning to media outlets about the limits of newsworthiness when publishing graphic content. Legal experts note the case has had a lasting impact, reinforcing privacy rights in the digital age.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders has revealed he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, for which he underwent surgery to remove his bladder. At a press conference with his medical team, doctors confirmed the procedure was successful and that Sanders is now considered "cancer-free." Sanders, who became emotional while discussing his journey, stated he never questioned "God, why me?" and intends to continue coaching. He used the announcement to encourage others, particularly African-American men, to prioritize their health and get regular medical checkups, emphasizing that early detection was crucial in his own positive outcome.</p>
