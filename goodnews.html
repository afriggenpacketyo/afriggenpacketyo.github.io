          <p>Despite receiving over 1.2 million fan votes and being named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was ranked only ninth among guards by her fellow players. The voting process combines input from fans (50%), media (25%), and players (25%), highlighting a significant disparity in perception between the public and her peers. While Clark leads the league in assists and has driven unprecedented popularity, her injury-shortened season and recent shooting struggles may have influenced the players' assessment. The final starter list reflects a blend of fan popularity and player-respected performance, with Clark securing her spot largely through overwhelming public support.</p>

          <p>A booming coffee culture in China is expanding beyond urban centers into the countryside, with a surge in new rural cafes designed to attract social media-savvy consumers with scenic views. China's coffee industry is now valued at over $42 billion, with net imports growing more than six-fold between 2020 and 2024. While this trend provides new economic opportunities, some observers question its long-term viability. Many of these cafes rely on a novelty factor that may fade after a single visit, suggesting the influencer-driven model might not be sustainable without evolving to offer more than just picturesque settings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made swift moves at the start of NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. The signing came shortly after the team lost a key defensive player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had been an important contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, averaged 6.9 points and shot 42.3% from three-point range last season, offering the Lakers a new option on the perimeter.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a comprehensive review of the nation's parental leave and pay policies, aiming to modernize a system that campaigners say is outdated and flawed. The review will examine statutory maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which have been criticized for low pay rates and complexity. With one in three fathers not taking paternity leave due to affordability issues and shared leave uptake remaining very low, the government acknowledges the need for reform. Campaign groups have lauded the review as a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families and promotes gender equality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new generation of younger investors is reshaping market dynamics by rewarding companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas rather than those focused on traditional metrics like stock buybacks. He argues these investors are drawn to the stories behind stocks like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash, seeing potential for massive future growth and clever financial engineering. This shift represents a move towards an "idea market" where individual company narratives hold more sway than macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, challenging the strategies of institutional investors who focus on beating indices.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen appreciable price increases resulting from U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. He attributed this to mitigation strategies, including significant forward-buying by Amazon and its third-party sellers to build up inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also highlighted the competitive nature of the marketplace, where many sellers absorb costs to gain market share, which helps keep prices stable for consumers. In the same interview, he called generative AI the "most transformative technology of our lifetime" and predicted most consumers would have robots in their homes within a decade.</p>

The move will end the country's general isolation from the international financial system. However, the White House clarified that targeted sanctions will remain on former president Bashar Assad, human rights abusers, and terrorist-affiliated groups. The order also directs a review of the terrorist designations for the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Syria's new transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p>

          <p>The UK's Privy Council, the final court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld a 2020 law that legalized same-sex civil partnerships in the British overseas territory. The ruling rejected a challenge that argued the governor overstepped his authority by enacting the law after the local parliament had voted it down. The original case was brought by a lesbian couple who were denied a marriage license. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners hailed the decision as a major victory that provides legal certainty for same-sex couples and could set a precedent for other British overseas territories fighting for similar rights.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list" after he paid over $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment for unpaid compensation. The dispute originated in 2019 when Emmett's former company failed to pay health benefits and other fees to four writers for a proposed TV show. The WGA's action had clouded Emmett's ability to work with guild members on current projects, including a planned collaboration with Martin Scorsese. Emmett stated he made the personal decision to settle the debt because it was "the right thing to do."</p>
