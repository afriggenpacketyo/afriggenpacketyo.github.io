          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move from Adelaide Cottage to the larger, eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. This move is reportedly prompted by a desire for a "fresh start" and a new chapter following a challenging period that included the Princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. Sources indicate the couple views Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home," where they intend to live even after ascending to the throne. The relocation and any necessary renovations will be funded privately, not through the Sovereign Grant, as they continue to prioritize a private family life.</p>

She achieved this milestone at Ormeau Park just four weeks after undergoing heart surgery, demonstrating remarkable resilience and determination. Chambers, who began running at age 88 after a suggestion from her rehabilitation team, has become a local legend and an inspiration to her community. She credits the social aspect of the weekly 5k run and the diverse community it brings together as key reasons for her continued participation.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters, developed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units, which can be constructed in just one week, are topped with solar panels and offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to tackling the affordable housing crisis. Stark's next project aims to build a 105-unit apartment complex from containers for low-income senior citizens.</p>

The breaches exposed sensitive information, including Social Security numbers and call records, for a vast number of current and former account holders. Eligible individuals can now file claims for documented losses, with potential payments of up to $7,500 per person if they were impacted by both incidents. The settlement requires final court approval, with a hearing scheduled for December 3, 2025, and claims must be submitted by November 18, 2025.</p>

          <p>Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, has built the dominant electronic health record software company while deliberately avoiding Silicon Valley norms. From Epic's whimsical Wisconsin campus, she has maintained private ownership, never taking venture capital and rejecting acquisition offers, ensuring the company's focus remains on its products and customers rather than quarterly earnings. With an estimated net worth of $7.8 billion, Faulkner has pledged to donate 99% of her assets to charity. She has also established a complex trust structure to ensure Epic remains privately held and true to her vision long after she is gone.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics. At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record and securing a narrow victory over Lyles, who finished in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second in the Olympic final a year ago. Both athletes are now looking ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, with Lyles expressing confidence despite the second-place finish.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a dive and rescue team located him using a drone. A California Highway Patrol helicopter successfully hoisted him to safety, and he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to implement a top-down strategy to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology. This technology involves orbiting facilities that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The scientist, Ge Changchun, argues that China's current research efforts are too fragmented and lag behind the United States in key areas. A more coordinated national effort is needed to gain a competitive edge in both the new energy sector and the broader space race.</p>

          <p>An alternative to intensive parenting, known as the "Lighthouse Parent" model, encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence rather than controlling every aspect of a child's life. This approach, advocated by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, suggests that while parents are biologically wired to prevent their children's suffering, constant intervention can be damaging for kids and exhausting for adults. By being a reliable guide—illuminating the way when needed but also standing back to allow for independent struggle—parents can help foster more confident and resilient children. This article compiles several pieces that explore the benefits of stepping back from constant supervision.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping to ease the transition to college for students coming from the foster care system by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with few personal belongings and are often unaware of the basic items they will need, from bedding and towels to lamps and toolboxes. The initiative, started in Los Angeles County, aims to level the playing field, allowing these students to feel prepared and equal to their peers on their first day. The program not only provides material goods but also connects students with a supportive community of peers who share similar experiences.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points is also contributing to its gains. In response, Apple is expected to release a slimmer iPhone model and is rumored to be developing its own foldable phone for a potential 2026 launch. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy, building emotional endurance—the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings—is key to resilience. She recommends three powerful steps to help navigate the frustrating process of learning and growth. First, use a visual diagram to remind yourself that the struggle between "not knowing" and "knowing" is a normal part of learning. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as opportunities. Finally, undertake small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds your capacity to tolerate discomfort in all areas of life.</p>
