          <p>The Trump administration has walked back an order that would have replaced Washington D.C.'s police chief, Pamela Smith, with a federal appointee. Following a lawsuit filed by the city, the Justice Department agreed to a new arrangement where the federal official will act as an intermediary rather than taking direct command of the force. This development resolves a key point of contention in the ongoing dispute over the federalization of the city's police. However, disagreements over federal immigration enforcement in the city are expected to continue in court next week.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it is built on. This development comes a year after the city enacted a law to allow such sales, aiming to create a new, more affordable path to homeownership. Officials hope this ADU condominium will serve as a model for other cities in the state, potentially creating a new generation of starter homes. While ADUs now account for a significant portion of new housing growth, their overall impact on the state's severe housing shortage remains a subject of debate.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Due to declining health, Gabriel could not travel but fulfilled his promise by conducting the Illinois-based band remotely from his home in Virginia. The contract was originally drawn up as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel, who served in World War II, emphasized the importance of keeping one's word, making the remote performance a touching and memorable event.</p>

          <p>New research from two Indian clinical trials is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes should avoid mangoes. The studies found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes. One study showed that mangoes produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, while another linked mango consumption to improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and that these findings are not a license for unlimited consumption of the fruit.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by depicting the late Lakers icon Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers-themed basketball jersey instead of his classic purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship and is located on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that he chose the iconic, celebratory pose of Bryant but altered the jersey to fit the mural's theme. The creative choice has elicited mixed but mostly positive reactions from fans.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to be worth nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, with several major Chinese chains recently launching successful IPOs in Hong Kong. The industry's rapid expansion is largely fueled by a franchise model, where parent companies profit from supplying ingredients while individual franchisees bear the operational costs. This has allowed chains like Mixue to open over 46,000 stores globally. However, the industry now faces challenges of market saturation and intense price wars, raising questions about whether its current boom is sustainable long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an affordable, American-made electric pickup truck by focusing on simplicity and customization. The base model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that the company plans to sell for significantly less than the average EV, with owners able to add over 100 different accessories. However, the company's initial sub-$20,000 price point relied on federal tax credits that are being rolled back, raising questions about its competitiveness at a higher price. Slate faces the challenge of convincing consumers to choose its barebones truck over similarly priced conventional models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the Trump administration's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The lawmakers argue that the president's move is an unlawful overreach, as there are no "special emergency conditions" to justify it under the D.C. Home Rule Act. The resolution asserts that the only emergency is a political one created by the administration itself. This legislative action represents a formal challenge to the executive order and aims to restore local control over the city's police force.</p>
