          <p>Three octogenarian Austrian nuns, Sister Bernadette (88), Sister Regina (86), and Sister Rita (82), defiantly fled a care home to return to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps, which they consider their rightful home. They regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith, asserting they were removed against their will in December 2023 despite a lifelong right of residence. Church authorities, including Provost Markus Grasl, deem their return "completely incomprehensible" due to the convent's unsuitability for proper care, citing their precarious health. The article highlights the nuns' determination to stay in their beloved home, where they had lived and taught for decades, with supporters rallying around them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The review for "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel, while offering agreeable silliness, fails to recapture the sharp satirical edge of the 1984 original mockumentary. Despite the return of co-creators Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, the film's comedy is reportedly sapped by an over-reliance on celebrity cameos, which undermine the original's outsider tension. The article praises early moments exploring the characters' solo lives, such as Nigel's cheese-and-guitar shop, but criticizes the forced reunion for an arena show as lacking essential oddball energy. Ultimately, the reviewer concludes that while the film won't harm the original's legacy, it serves more as a nostalgic lap than a fresh, incisive mockumentary, with jokes feeling worn out.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill overriding local zoning laws to permit high-density housing near transit hubs, now heading to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk. Introduced by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill allows for buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops and six stories within a half-mile, including single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue these drastic measures are necessary to address the state's severe affordability crisis and leverage existing transit investments. Critics, however, claim it's an overreach that strips local authority, could negatively impact lower-priced neighborhoods, and has spurred protests. The article highlights the bill's controversial nature and its potential to unlock hundreds of thousands of new multifamily homes.</p>
