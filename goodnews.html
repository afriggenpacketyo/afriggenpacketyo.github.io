        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the crucial origins and historical context of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which addresses presidential succession and disability. It highlights the dedicated efforts of John Feerick, an idealistic young lawyer who, years before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, recognized and campaigned for the necessity of clear constitutional provisions for such scenarios. The amendment's eventual ratification provided vital clarity on what should happen if a U.S. president is no longer able to serve, ensuring governmental continuity and stability. The article underscores the foresight and painstaking process involved in establishing this essential legal framework for moments of national leadership transition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:53:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter, driven primarily by growth in services and construction, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This positive data follows a strong first quarter and comes despite earlier contractions in April and May, partly due to tariff changes. However, economists caution that this momentum is unlikely to continue into the third quarter, citing a softening labor market and persistent inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, balancing sticky inflation with subdued growth and a loosening job market, highlighting the finely balanced economic situation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has definitively dismissed a significant copyright claim against the globally viral children's song "Baby Shark," affirming lower court decisions. The lawsuit, seeking 30 million won, was brought by US composer Jonathan Wright, who alleged the 2015 hit by The Pinkfong Company copied his 2011 rendition. However, the court ruled that Wright's version lacked sufficient originality to qualify for copyright protection, as both songs are based on a traditional melody widely popular at US summer camps. This ruling confirms that "Baby Shark" is fundamentally derived from a traditional singalong chant that has entered the public domain, providing legal clarity for the song's creators.</p>

          <p>Wayne Rooney, the former head coach of Birmingham City, expressed his "really disappointed" reaction to what he called "very unfair" comments made by NFL legend Tom Brady regarding his work ethic. Brady, a minority owner at Birmingham, had questioned Rooney's application during a documentary, stating concerns after a visit to the club's training ground. Rooney clarified that the demands of football differ significantly from NFL, emphasizing the need for player rest, and suggested Brady lacked a full understanding of the sport's nuances. Despite the public disagreement, Rooney acknowledged Brady's status as a top athlete and noted the recent improvements at Birmingham City, defending his own tenure by highlighting the club's pre-existing challenges.</p>

          <p>A growing trend known as "bleisure" travel is seeing over half of business travelers, and a higher percentage of C-suite executives, bringing loved ones along on work trips. This practice allows professionals to maximize their time by combining work obligations with personal leisure, offering companions a cost-effective travel opportunity as some expenses like hotels may be covered by the employer. While many employees do not explicitly disclose these arrangements to their companies, the trend is generally accepted as long as core business objectives are met and personal expenses are clearly separated from company costs. This blend of professional and personal travel is projected for significant global growth, reflecting a shift in work-life balance priorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who report drinking alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a figure last seen in 1958. This significant decline is attributed to a growing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even when consumed in moderation, a shift from previous scientific understanding. Younger generations, in particular, show heightened concern about the harmful effects of drinking. Experts suggest that factors such as increased social acceptance of sobriety, the rising popularity of alcohol-free alternatives, and economic pressures may be contributing to this trend, though further data is needed to confirm it as a sustained societal shift.</p>
