          <p>The CNBC Investing Club announced it is increasing its holdings in both Cisco Systems and Honeywell, citing underlying strengths despite recent market pressures. The club is purchasing Cisco shares following a valuation-based downgrade, arguing the market undervalues its AI potential and shift to subscription revenue. It is also acquiring more Honeywell stock after a price drop, viewing the company's temporary business challenges as a strategic buying opportunity during its transformation.

          <p>After years of significant crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought out of retirement to helm the company. Investors are responding positively, with stock prices up over 30% this year as aircraft production and delivery numbers improve. Despite progress, challenges remain, including an FAA production cap on the 737 Max and a potential strike at its defense unit. Airline executives have noted improvements in quality and delivery consistency, though delays for certain models persist.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire" to end five days of intense border fighting that killed at least 33 people and displaced tens of thousands. The agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who mediated the talks. The truce was reached following pressure from the U.S., which threatened to halt trade negotiations if the conflict continued. Both nations will now need to de-escalate military forces and establish independent monitoring to prevent further clashes along the disputed border.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Scotland, President Trump met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and announced the finalization of a major trade deal with the European Union. The agreement sets a 15% tariff for most EU imports, avoiding a threatened 30% rate, while the EU will eliminate tariffs on U.S. goods and increase investments. During the visit, Trump also reiterated his intent to shorten the 50-day deadline given to Russia for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The new EU deal has been met with some criticism within Europe, notably from France.</p>

          <p>British speedway champion Tai Woffinden has ridden a bike for the first time since a life-threatening crash in Poland four months ago. The 34-year-old suffered extensive injuries, including a broken back and leg, and was placed in a medically induced coma. Woffinden, Great Britain's most decorated rider, posted a video of himself riding at a track in Wroclaw, calling the recovery the biggest challenge of his life.

          <p>Recent U.S. trade deals with Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which lower American tariffs in exchange for near-zero tariffs on U.S. goods, may impact European exporters. While some EU exports could be displaced by American products, analysts suggest the deals could also pressure these Southeast Asian nations to offer similar low-tariff terms to Europe. The agreements were finalized ahead of a U.S. deadline and a separate deal between the U.S. and the EU. This new trade landscape could intensify competition but also strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese AI startup Z.ai has announced a new open-source model, GLM-4.5, which it claims is cheaper to operate than competing models like DeepSeek. The company states the new model is built on "agentic" AI, allowing it to break down complex tasks for greater accuracy, and requires only eight of Nvidia's specialized H20 chips to run. This development continues a trend of Chinese firms releasing powerful and cost-effective AI models, challenging established players like OpenAI. Z.ai's announcement comes amid heightened U.S. scrutiny of China's advancements in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP), are looking to capitalize on their success in defeating a recent recall vote. The vote, which targeted 24 KMT lawmakers, failed to remove any of them from their seats, a result seen as a major setback for President William Lai Ching-te's ruling party. The outcome has energized the informal "Blue-White" alliance between the opposition parties. Observers believe this momentum could strengthen their position ahead of the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining population, China has announced its first national childcare subsidy program. The government will provide an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan for every child under the age of three, starting with those born on or after January 1, 2025. This policy marks a significant shift toward direct financial support for families, aiming to reverse a downward demographic trend that threatens long-term economic growth. However, some economists caution that the subsidy amount may be too small to have a substantial immediate impact on the birth rate.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is proposing a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) plan to tackle the country's severe housing shortage and rising rents. The legislation aims to streamline building approvals by allowing municipalities to circumvent complex planning laws for new residential projects and by setting automatic approval deadlines. The plan is a response to a construction industry slowdown caused by rising costs and interest rates. While officials hope it will accelerate development, critics express environmental concerns and question whether it will be effective without additional economic stimulus.</p>
