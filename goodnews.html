          <p>Buckingham Palace has confirmed that King Charles has extended an invitation for a state visit to Donald Trump later this year. The visit is scheduled for September, as scheduling conflicts prevented an informal meeting over the summer. The invitation, signed by the King, was delivered to the White House by representatives from the British Embassy in Washington. This visit marks Trump's second official state visit to the UK, with formal planning now underway.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are currently stuck in a holding pattern, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and international conflicts. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slightly increased to 6.88%, but has remained within a narrow range since early April. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped slightly, but are still higher than the same week last year, although overall demand remains historically low. Applications to refinance a home loan rose, but small changes in volume make for big percentage moves.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO summit in the Netherlands, where discussions are focused on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Trump has claimed that U.S. strikes destroyed Iran's ability to build nuclear weapons, but an early intelligence assessment suggests limited damage. NATO allies are also working on a new commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. Trump's commitment to Article 5, the mutual defense clause in the NATO treaty, remains a point of concern for European allies.</p>

          <p>With the Lakers lacking a first-round pick and the Clippers holding the 30th overall pick, both teams are expected to focus on selecting the best available players in the upcoming NBA draft. The Lakers' primary need is a rim-running, shot-blocking young center, while the Clippers could use frontcourt help, a playmaker, and shooting. The Lakers' key focus will be the contract status of Luka Doncic, LeBron James, Austin Reaves, and Dorian Finney-Smith. The Clippers have several veterans with contract decisions to make, including James Harden, Nicolas Batum, and Norman Powell.</p>

Maintaining a cordial relationship with in-laws can benefit the partner and children, but it requires open communication, boundary-setting, and a willingness to compromise.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that there is "great progress" being made in negotiations to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Trump also claimed that the strikes would help with the release of the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. These statements follow reports of an initial intelligence evaluation suggesting limited damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, which Trump has labeled "fake news."</p>
