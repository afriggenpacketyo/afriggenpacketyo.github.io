          <p>Max Verstappen topped Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, but voiced significant concerns about his Red Bull's long-run pace, stating the "rest, everything else was pretty bad." Concurrently, McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri reported struggles, with Norris acknowledging the team was "a little bit behind" and grappling with inconsistent balance. Despite Verstappen's strong single-lap performance, he emphasized that qualifying speed alone wouldn't secure a race win without improved long-run dynamics.

          <h2>September CPI Report Shows Inflation Climbs Moderately Amid Tariff Impacts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at an annual rate of 3% in September, which was slightly below economists' projections, with President Trump's tariffs contributing to inflationary pressures. Businesses are reportedly absorbing some of these costs, yet up to 55% of import taxes are being passed to consumers through higher prices. This crucial economic report, released despite the ongoing government shutdown, is vital for calculating Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment. The article highlights the Federal Reserve's complex challenge in balancing rising inflation with a weakening job market, suggesting the moderate CPI data might still support an upcoming interest rate cut.
