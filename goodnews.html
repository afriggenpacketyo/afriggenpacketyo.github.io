          <p>Warren Buffett outlines his three categories of investments: currency-denominated assets, non-productive assets like gold, and productive assets such as farms or businesses. He argues that gold is a speculative bet on future fear, as it produces nothing and its value depends solely on someone else paying more for it later. Buffett emphasizes his preference for investing in productive assets that generate tangible returns over time, making their intrinsic value the key metric for success rather than short-term market fluctuations.

          <p>A growing movement in cities across the globe is reallocating street space from cars to bicycles, creating cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable urban areas. By implementing protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and cyclist-specific traffic signals, cities like New York, London, and Ghent are making cycling a safer and more appealing option for daily commutes. This shift not only reduces carbon emissions and noise pollution but also offers significant health benefits and cost savings for residents, despite facing some cultural resistance from car-centric communities.</p>

          <p>Charnwood Borough Council has approved Loughborough University's plan to construct five new student accommodation buildings, despite opposition from local residents. The development, which will provide 552 flats, faced 45 complaints from neighbors concerned that the four- to six-story halls will dominate their homes, invade privacy, and cause noise and light pollution. The university defended the project as essential for its future competitiveness, arguing it will help fund academic services and keep students in a supportive on-campus environment.</p>

          <p>Marissa Coreno, an Ohio woman diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer at age 27, is sharing her story to urge young women to be vigilant about their health. Despite having no family history, she sought medical advice after finding a lump in her armpit, leading to her diagnosis and an intensive treatment regimen including chemotherapy and a double mastectomy. Now cancer-free, Coreno highlights the rising incidence of breast cancer in younger women and emphasizes that early detection is crucial, as life after treatment can still be beautiful and fulfilling.</p>

          <p>The market for trading cards, including sports and Pokémon, is experiencing a massive boom, becoming a billion-dollar category for retailers like Target and Walmart. This resurgence is driven largely by Millennial and Gen Z consumers, who are drawn to the nostalgia and see the cards as an affordable luxury or even an alternative investment. Strategic card sales have more than doubled year-to-date, prompting major retailers to increase their stock and feature exclusive weekly releases to capitalize on the consistent, year-round demand ahead of the holiday season.

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced eventually remarry. The study highlights that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarriage often leads to improved financial stability, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being comparable to those in their first marriage. Experts note that while people entering second marriages often do so with more foresight, these unions also have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among older adults.</p>

A key theme is the necessity of self-care, which is defined not as luxury but as setting boundaries and protecting one's own mental and physical health to endure the marathon of caregiving.</p>

          <p>Despite being dismissed by some as cringe-worthy and ineffective during Trump's first term, the anti-Trump Resistance movement is re-emerging with a more hard-bitten but still idealistic approach. An article argues that the movement's earnest belief in democratic principles, while sometimes appearing uncool, is a powerful antidote to the cynicism and nihilism of authoritarianism. The upcoming 'No Kings' protests, expected to be massive, demonstrate that this sincere, community-based organizing remains a potent force in countering anti-democratic actions, shifting from performative marches to tangible, local-level engagement.</p>

          <p>The first Twenty20 international match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out by rain, but not before all-rounder Sam Curran played a crucial role with the bat. England struggled on a difficult pitch, slumping to 81-5 before Curran's unbeaten 49 from 35 balls helped them post a competitive total of 153-6. However, persistent rain prevented New Zealand from beginning their chase, leading to a frustrating no-result start to the white-ball series, which serves as preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>
