The summit is expected to draw over 20 world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, whose attendance marks his first visit to China in seven years. Analysts view the gathering as a key opportunity for China to assert its diplomatic influence and project itself as a major world power amid escalating global geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>A report of an active shooter at Villanova University triggered a campus-wide lockdown and a massive law enforcement response, but was later confirmed by officials to be a "cruel hoax." The false alarm caused widespread panic among students and families who were on campus for orientation day activities. This incident, potentially a case of "swatting," occurred shortly after a similar false threat at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, prompting investigations and calls from officials to hold the perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on his dating life in Los Angeles, where he ultimately diverged from his mother's advice to marry a nice Jewish girl. He humorously recounts a series of diverse romantic encounters before meeting and falling in love with Carol, a Korean woman who became his wife. The narrative explores the process of navigating cultural differences, gaining family acceptance, and building a multicultural, interfaith family, concluding with the belief that his late mother would have been happy with the outcome.</p>

          <p>A randomized controlled trial conducted by the charity GiveDirectly in rural Kenya found that providing one-time cash grants of approximately $1,871 to impoverished households led to a 48% reduction in infant and child mortality. The study suggests the cash improved outcomes by enabling better nutrition, more hospital-based births, and allowing mothers to reduce work hours around childbirth. However, the article notes an important caveat: while effective, the program was significantly less cost-effective at saving lives than targeted health interventions like vitamin supplementation or malaria prevention.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), the country's most prestigious institute for engineering sciences, has shortlisted a record number of scientists and executives from private companies for membership. This year's candidate list includes 19 individuals from leading firms in AI, new energy, and biopharmaceuticals, such as iFlyTek, CATL, and BYD. The move, which includes reserving eight seats specifically for private-sector leaders, signals high-level recognition of the vital role that private enterprises play in driving national technological innovation.</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal to allow more individuals to become "accredited investors" by passing a knowledge test, rather than solely meeting income or net worth thresholds, is gaining traction. This would open up high-risk, high-reward private market investments to a broader audience. However, experts caution that designing a test that can effectively assess an investor's understanding of the unique risks associated with private assets—such as illiquidity and subjective valuation—and truly protect them from substantial losses is an incredibly difficult task.

          <p>A new species of herbivorous dinosaur unearthed on the Isle of Wight has been officially named *Istiorachis macaruthurae* in honor of Dame Ellen MacArthur, the record-breaking round-the-world sailor. The dinosaur is notable for its unusually long neural spines, which formed a prominent "sail" along its back, a feature that scientists likened to the sails of a yacht. Dame Ellen expressed that she was honored by the gesture, which links her name to a creature that lived 125 million years ago.</p>
