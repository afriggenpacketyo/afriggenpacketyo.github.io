          <p>Tencent Holdings reported a 15% year-on-year revenue increase for its second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations with sales reaching 184.5 billion yuan. The growth was largely attributed to investments in artificial intelligence, which enhanced its advertising platform, and a strong performance from its gaming division. Key games like "Delta Force" and evergreen titles such as "Honor of Kings" boosted domestic revenue, while the international gaming business grew by 35%. The company also saw continued growth in its music subscription services and is expanding its cloud computing capabilities to Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprising and unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The bid from the three-year-old firm, which is backed by prominent investors like Jeff Bezos, is viewed by many industry analysts as a publicity stunt, with Chrome's actual value estimated to be significantly higher. The offer comes as a US judge is expected to rule on an antitrust case that could potentially force Google to divest its search business. Perplexity stated its bid represents a commitment to the open web and user choice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since the tumultuous mini-budget of September 2022, the average interest rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%. Financial data firm Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," indicating increased competition among lenders. The 2022 mini-budget under former Prime Minister Liz Truss had caused market turmoil and a sharp rise in borrowing costs. While rates have been cut five times since last August, they remain significantly higher than the levels seen before the mini-budget, and substantial further drops are considered unlikely.

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to power artificial intelligence data centers with its small modular reactors (SMRs) could make it the most valuable company in the UK. Since Erginbilgic took over in January 2023, the engineering firm's share price has increased tenfold. The company has already secured deals with the UK and Czech governments to provide SMRs, aiming to meet the massive energy demands of the growing AI industry. Despite this focus on nuclear technology, the CEO also highlighted plans to expand into the larger market for narrow-bodied aircraft engines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant travel trend is emerging as Czech tourists are increasingly opting for Poland's Baltic coast for their summer holidays, shifting away from their traditional destination of Croatia. Factors driving this change include a desire for milder climates to escape extreme summer heat and improved infrastructure, such as new toll-free motorways and direct train links. Polish media has noted the "Czech invasion" as a positive development for tourism. While prices are comparable to Czech cities, and still cheaper than Germany's coast, the cooler, rainier weather presents a different experience than the Mediterranean. </p>

          <p>A ranking of second-year NFL quarterbacks reveals a diverse group, from a potential MVP candidate to relative unknowns. Jayden Daniels of the Washington Commanders is praised for having one of the best rookie seasons in modern history, earning a perfect confidence score. In contrast, Chicago's Caleb Williams had a flat rookie season in an ill-fitting system, and his success now hinges on his partnership with new offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. Others like Denver's Bo Nix and New England's Drake Maye showed significant promise and are expected to build on their solid rookie campaigns with improved team support.</p>

          <p>Despite growing technological pressures like replay reviews and automated ball-strike systems, aspiring umpires continue to pursue a career in Major League Baseball. At a recent MLB umpire camp in Milwaukee, candidates expressed that new technologies, while increasing scrutiny, also serve as tools to help them achieve their ultimate goal of making correct calls. Instructors and MLB officials acknowledge that the pressure is higher than ever, as every decision can be instantly analyzed. A key attribute for new umpires is now the mental toughness to handle having their calls publicly overturned in real-time.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Effective Pep Talks Should Prioritize Listening Over Giving Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to authors and comedians Josh Linden and Paula Skaggs, a good pep talk often involves more listening and encouragement than offering revolutionary advice. They suggest tailoring the message to the specific anxiety the person is facing, showing them you are on their side. Simple, specific affirmations can be more powerful than vague clichés. The authors also emphasize that pep talks are not just for major life events but can be meaningful for everyday challenges as well. Sometimes, the most effective approach is to simply bear witness to someone's struggle and remind them of truths they already know.</p>

          <p>Men diagnosed with cancer, particularly those under 40, tend to fare worse emotionally and physically than women, often isolating themselves and seeking less support. This can lead to severe mental health deterioration and a higher risk of suicide. To combat this, support groups like Man Up to Cancer are being created to provide fellowship and an outlet for men to discuss their struggles with the disease. These groups aim to change cultural norms that discourage men from showing emotional vulnerability, creating spaces where they can share their fears and find camaraderie with fellow survivors.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Potato's Origin Lies in Ancient Hybridization of Tomato and Etuberosum Ancestors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study suggests the humble potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between the ancestors of tomatoes and a plant group called Etuberosum. This hybridization, which occurred around 9 million years ago, uniquely combined genes that allowed the new lineage to produce tubers, a trait neither parent possessed. This development was perfectly timed for the rise of the Andes mountains, as the hardy potato was well-suited to the new high-elevation habitat. Researchers hope this discovery could lead to breeding improved potato varieties that are more resistant to disease and climate change.</p>

          <h2>The Linguistic Mystery Behind the Origin of the Word 'Dog'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "dog," one of the most common in the English language, has a mysterious origin that linguists have yet to solve. The term only replaced the older word "hound" as the standard for canines around 500 years ago, likely evolving from a pet name or even an insult. Before becoming a term of affection, early forms of "dog" were often used as a derogatory term for people. While theories suggest it could derive from Old English words for "dark-colored" or "strong," its true etymological roots remain unclear, making it a notable puzzle in linguistics.</p>
