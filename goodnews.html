          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence defied pressure from then-President Trump to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during the Congressional session on January 6, 2021. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the peaceful transfer of power. Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party, and his own presidential run in 2024 was unsuccessful.</p>
