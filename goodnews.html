          <p>Equinor will resume construction on its Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm in New York after the Trump administration lifted a stop-work order. The Interior Department initially halted the project due to concerns about insufficient analysis, but the decision was reversed following discussions with Equinor and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. The project, which aims to deliver electricity directly to New York City, is expected to begin commercial operations in 2027 and supports 1,500 union jobs. The approval followed what appears to be a compromise regarding a gas pipeline project with the state.</p>

The airline has informed affected flight attendants, who are members of Union Sindical Obrera, that the overpayment will be deducted from their payslips until the debt is settled. The union is exploring legal solutions, while Ryanair has declined to comment on the number of affected employees or potential consequences of non-payment.

Despite sticking points among Republican hard-liners regarding Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions, Trump asserted that the bill would not cut anything meaningful. He praised Johnson for doing a "fantastic job" as the Speaker faces a crucial leadership test in ushering the bill through the House.</p>

Democrats have criticized the offer, raising ethical and security concerns under the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and have submitted a resolution calling for Trump to submit plans for the donation to Congress.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that would allow asset managers to offer an ETF share class of an existing mutual fund, potentially giving investors more choice. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief to do so, but the SEC has been hesitant due to concerns about the tax implications of co-mingling the funds. One risk is that ETF shareclass holders may end up subsidizing the mutual fund class holders. The Dimensional amendment includes updated guidelines around oversight of funds that could help navigate issues like tax impact.</p>

          <p>Home Depot announced it will maintain current pricing levels, contrasting with Walmart's warning of price hikes due to tariffs. The home improvement retailer is working with suppliers to hold prices steady and is shifting production out of China to avoid tariffs. More than half of Home Depot's goods are domestically produced, and the company aims to further reduce reliance on China. This decision follows President Trump's criticism of Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, with Trump asserting that Walmart should "eat the tariffs."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has prompted questions about the stability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power. Some have suggested that Spain's high reliance on renewables was at fault, but the country's grid operator and prime minister have disputed this. Experts suggest the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources. They also recommend investing in better battery storage, increasing grid flexibility, and improving connections to neighboring countries to enhance grid stability.</p>

This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would raise prices to cover higher costs from tariffs. Home Depot maintained its full-year sales forecast despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, attributing negative sales results in February to poor weather.</p>

About 40% of the total amount raised by U.S. venture funds last year was from funds that "list AI as a focus." Excluding AI investment, there is no meaningful uptick for companies not leveraging AI, with investment from this group essentially flat for the last year. Many investors were bullish that President Donald Trump's return to the White House would reinvigorate the startup economy, but the aggressive tariff policy announced in early April led several companies to delay planned IPOs.</p>
