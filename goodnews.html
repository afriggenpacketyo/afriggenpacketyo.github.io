          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and discussions of de-dollarization intensify, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming increasingly crucial for China's efforts to internationalize the yuan. According to Mary Huen Wai-yi, businesses in Qatar are eager to utilize the yuan through Hong Kong's financial tools, such as settlement, payment, and hedging capabilities. This trend reflects a broader shift as countries and businesses seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international transactions, aligning with China's long-term strategy to reduce risks and assert financial independence. The article highlights the growing financial ties between China and Qatar, particularly in new energy and technology sectors.</p>

          <p>NHS England plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate pressure on emergency departments. These clinics will offer walk-in services and referrals from GPs and police, providing specialized care for individuals experiencing acute mental distress. The goal is to offer appropriate care in a calm setting, avoiding long waits in A&E. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for thorough testing and adequate funding for these new provisions, as well as concern about separating physical and mental health problems so simply.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1, resulting in two commercial jets aborting their landings at a Washington airport. According to the Army, the loss of contact, lasting about 20 seconds, occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction. The FAA directed go-arounds for the commercial aircraft out of caution, due to conflicting positional data. The Army has paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety concerns with the FAA, and the NTSB expressed disappointment in the Army's release of investigative information prior to briefing the agency.</p>

He argues that as the United States becomes more U.S.-centric, AI could become a bargaining chip, making it crucial for Japan to develop its own secure and efficient information systems using AI.

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the bloc's commitment to securing a trade deal with the U.S. based on mutual respect, following threats from President Trump to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the EU. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, and the EU stands ready to defend its interests. The EU is one of Washington's largest trading partners, and European governments have expressed that negotiations are the best way forward.</p>

          <h2>Kneecap Defiant at First Major Gig Since Terror Charge</h2>

          <p>Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap performed their biggest festival headline gig just days after a band member, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, was charged with a terror offence. The band denied the offence, calling it "political policing" and "a carnival of distraction" away from Gaza. The rapper urged fans to be "on the right side of history," and the gig culminated in renditions of Kneecap songs, with the band encouraging fans to bellow out the Irish Republican slogan "Tiocfaidh ár lá". The UN said on Friday that Gaza was in the "cruellest phase" of war, with 9,000 trucks' worth of aid ready at the border for the Palestinian territory.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available to consumers at 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative seeks to address mounting criticism over rising rice prices that have hurt households amid ongoing inflation. The government intends to commence procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached record levels, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons initially, with potential for additional supplies if necessary.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council, with some staff reassignments and departures. The changes come weeks after President Trump replaced his national security adviser, and aim to eliminate bureaucracy and duplication. Andy Baker, Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, is taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. Some former members of the National Security Council said the institution is strained, pointing to deep suspicions of the NSC within both Trump administrations as well as the Biden administration.</p>
