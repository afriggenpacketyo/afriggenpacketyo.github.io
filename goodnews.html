          <p>A Chinese think tank, the Grandview Institution, suggests that the United States and China establish a "security dialogue mechanism" to prevent conflicts in the South China Sea. The think tank's report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, notes that aerial and maritime interactions between the two countries in the region are confrontational and unpredictable. Despite the competition, the report suggests the situation is manageable, but implementation of crisis management tools remains inconsistent. Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi advocate for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security, maritime legal order, law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols.</p>

Officials are evaluating how Indian Rare Earths (IREL) can increase rare earth magnet production, offering a potential alternative supply for countries like the U.S. Union Minister Piyush Goyal has called China's export pause a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to step up. Despite China's signaling plans to ease controls, India's efforts could reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates rare earth production and processing. This initiative requires significant public and private investment to realize its potential.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee's global consumption is deeply rooted in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, extending beyond fleeting trends. Originating in Ethiopia, coffee ceremonies are integral to hospitality and community, while Senegal's "cafe Touba" blends spiritual practice with the beverage. Turkish coffee culture includes reading leftover grounds, and Brazil's cafezinho symbolizes welcome. Rising global temperatures and erratic rainfall threaten coffee farmers, causing prices to soar, yet coffee remains a vital part of world culture, with approximately two billion cups consumed daily. From mythical origins to modern-day rituals, coffee connects people worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China by the United States, Beijing has taken measures to assist Chinese exporters in shifting their focus to the domestic market. One of these measures is the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, function similarly to international L/Cs, guaranteeing payment for goods or services. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can also be used in the trade of services, providing greater flexibility for businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment in ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States, particularly concerning auto tariffs, after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a potential increase in import levies on cars. Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed confidence that Japan would receive separate treatment once a bilateral deal is finalized. Trump's threat to raise auto tariffs aims to attract more investment in American manufacturing.

          <p>An expert from the World Gold Council argues that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist, highlights that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. He stresses that these digital assets lack the characteristics of gold and should not be marketed as "gold 2.0". Reade's comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and a fresh rally in gold prices.</p>
