        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the US, burdened by debt and increased competition from weight loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The company plans to restructure its debt, writing off $1.15 billion while continuing operations without impacting its members. WeightWatchers acknowledges a rapidly changing weight management landscape due to the popularity of these injections, but aims to continue offering its weight-loss programs, telehealth services, and workshops. The company states that the bankruptcy plan has the support of its lenders, ensuring a smooth transition during this 'significant transition'.</p>

          <p>Experts predict a slight decrease in federal student loan interest rates for the 2025-2026 academic year. Interest rates for direct undergraduate loans could be 6.39%, down from 6.53% in 2024-2025, while graduate student loans may see a decrease from 8.08% to 7.94%. Parent PLUS loans could drop from 9.08% to 8.94%. These rates are calculated based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note, with the government setting the rates annually for loans disbursed between July 1 and June 30 of the following year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of May 7th, U.S. travelers are now required to present a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification, such as a passport, for domestic air travel. Despite initial concerns about delays, many airports experienced normal or even lower-than-usual wait times, with a significant percentage of travelers prepared for the new requirement. The TSA has extra staff on hand to assist travelers and clarify acceptable forms of ID, advising passengers to arrive at least three hours early if they lack a Real ID. While the deadline has passed, individuals can still apply for a Real ID, but should be wary of potential scams and only apply in person at the DMV.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has abandoned some of the most aggressive proposals to cut Medicaid costs, revealing divisions within the Republican party regarding funding for President Trump‚Äôs domestic agenda. House Republicans have decided against lowering federal payments to states for working-age adults enrolled through the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs Medicaid expansion and are also likely to reject a shift to flat fee payments per person. This retreat underscores the difficulty Republicans face in achieving their spending cut targets while securing enough votes for passage, with ultraconservatives expressing their opposition and insisting on deficit-neutral reconciliation bills.</p>

The attraction aims to blend Disney's signature entertainment with the cultural essence of Abu Dhabi, hoping to attract visitors from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to address economic matters. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods, aiming to rectify the trade deficit, while China has retaliated with tariffs of its own. Both sides express a willingness to negotiate, with the U.S. seeking fair trade and China emphasizing equality and mutual benefit, amidst ongoing concerns about fentanyl trafficking and trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has granted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) an exemption to hire a new class of its Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers, averting a potential cut to the program. This decision ensures the continuation of the CDC's "disease detectives," who play a crucial role in investigating outbreaks and responding to health emergencies. The fate of the program had been uncertain due to a federal hiring freeze, but the exemption allows the CDC to onboard and train the newly selected EIS officers. This program is seen as a vital pathway for aspiring public health workers to begin their careers at the agency.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs as policymakers evaluate the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed will keep the federal funds rate in its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has remained since the last rate cut in December. The central bank signaled rising economic risks, stating that "uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further," while also noting that the jobless rate has stabilized.

          <p>This article delves into the origins of the "woke right," arguing that it predates the woke left and finds its roots in the right-wing populism of figures like Pat Buchanan. Buchanan's 2011 book, "Suicide of a Superpower," is presented as a manifesto of identity grievance, ethnic consciousness, and tribal striving, advocating for white people to unite against the rising tide of nonwhite populations. The article contrasts Buchanan's approach with Obama-era liberalism and highlights his focus on hierarchy and traditional values, while also noting similarities between Buchanan's worldview and that of Donald Trump, particularly regarding nationalism and skepticism toward international cooperation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, prospective home equity borrowers have an opportunity to analyze their options. Historically, home equity loans were favored during rate pauses due to their fixed rates. However, the current climate suggests a potential rate cut in the near future, making HELOCs, with their variable rates, a potentially better option. The average HELOC interest rate is currently lower than home equity loan rates, and HELOCs have seen more significant rate drops recently, offering potential savings.
