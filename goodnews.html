          <h2>Market Analyst Outlines Ten Factors Supporting Stocks Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, this article argues against conventional wisdom suggesting market turmoil. It posits that highly valued tech stocks are insulated from trade disputes and lists ten positive drivers for the market, including strong corporate earnings and a proposed tax bill that would inject billions into the U.S. economy. The analysis also points to major infrastructure needs, increased bank lending capacity, and a pro-business M&A environment as reasons for optimism, suggesting these factors outweigh tariff-related risks.

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ predicts that the technology will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade systems, which it sells globally. The founder and CEO, Xiang Jingen, tempers this optimism by comparing the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s. He emphasizes that significant development is still required before the technology achieves broad, mainstream applicability.</p>

          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the 153rd iteration of the tournament at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. The world's top-ranked player finished with a dominant four-stroke lead, marking his second major tournament victory of 2025. This win brings the 29-year-old one step closer to achieving a career Grand Slam, a feat accomplished by winning all four of golf's major championships. He now joins an elite group including Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Tiger Woods as one of the few to win three of the four majors before age 30.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas Hill Country have announced a significant drop in the number of people considered missing after the devastating Fourth of July weekend floods, with the count now down to just three. Initially, authorities had reported approximately 100 people were unaccounted for across several counties. The reduction is credited to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that many individuals were safe. Recovery efforts are still ongoing along the Guadalupe River watershed, where the flash floods caused at least 135 fatalities.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The clash, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners at a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry, chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

A unique feature allows teachers to monitor student interactions with the AI, which has raised some privacy concerns among students. However, this oversight has also proven to be a crucial safety net, as the system can flag conversations indicating a student may be in emotional distress or considering self-harm, enabling timely intervention.</p>

This report from Oaxaca, Mexico, highlights the traditional, handcrafted production methods that resist industrialization, a process passed down through generations of Zapotec families. It tells the story of the Hernandez brothers, who left Mexico for the U.S. but returned to expand their family distillery, Mal de Amor, as demand boomed. Their partnership with an American entrepreneur, now backed by global spirits company Bacardi, illustrates the spirit's journey from a local tradition to a half-billion-dollar industry.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. It suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings. The expert provides practical tips, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to help parents nurture this non-negotiable skill.</p>
