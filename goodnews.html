          <p>The Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades is now operational after being out of service since early 2024 for repairs to its torn floating cover. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced the completion of the work, which was delayed by additional leaks discovered during a previous refilling attempt. The reservoir's offline status during a destructive January firestorm has prompted questions and criticism from residents and officials, who are concerned that it may have contributed to water supply issues for firefighters. The incident highlights the need for improved management and emergency readiness of the city's critical water infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech giant Xiaomi surged to a record high after the successful launch of its second electric vehicle, the YU7 SUV. The company strategically priced the new model below Tesla's popular Model Y in China, generating over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its release. This aggressive pricing strategy is part of an intensifying EV price war in the country. While Xiaomi claims the YU7 surpasses the Model Y on several metrics, it acknowledges it falls short in driver-assist technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The notorious error message, which appears after a critical system failure, will now be displayed on a black background. This change is part of a broader initiative to improve system resilience and streamline the user experience during unexpected restarts, following the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage.

          <p>The White House has suggested that President Trump could extend the 90-day pause on his administration's reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire on July 9. A spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, depending on the progress of negotiations with key trading partners like Japan. The remarks came as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks aimed at securing concessions on the higher duties. The policy imposes a baseline 10% duty on all imports, with additional country-specific tariffs for nations with significant trade surpluses with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The "cool block" project, run by the environmental group GreenRoots, has introduced over 100 new trees, resurfaced the street with heat-reflecting light colors, and painted rooftops white. These measures are designed to cool a neighborhood that residents say can feel like a desert in summer. As climate change increases the frequency of extreme heat waves, such localized, green infrastructure projects could provide a vital template for other cities.</p>
