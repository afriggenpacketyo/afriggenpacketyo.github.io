        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, New York's longest-serving House member, will not seek re-election in 2026, citing a "necessity for generational change" within the party. His decision was influenced by former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election. Nadler, 78, first elected in 1992, previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as a manager for former President Trump's first impeachment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a relentless fighter for justice and civil rights, acknowledging his significant contributions to the Democratic Caucus.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers for Powerball's estimated $1.2 billion jackpot, which ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history, have been drawn. Uncertainty remains regarding whether any single ticket successfully matched all the numbers. This substantial jackpot grew after no winner emerged from Saturday night's $1 billion drawing, which still awarded nine tickets $1 million and three tickets $2 million with the "power play" option. A single winner would face a choice between a lump sum of $498.4 million before taxes or an annuity with increasing annual payments. The next drawing is set for Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. ET.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers in Beijing have developed a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed for astronauts, addressing the challenge of limited water in space. The cube-shaped device, weighing 12kg, uses only 400ml of water per cycle, delivered as an ultra-fine mist, to clean up to 800 grams of clothing. Instead of traditional detergent, it employs ultraviolet light to produce ozone, which effectively sterilizes clothes for multiple wears. This innovative solution from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre aims to improve hygiene and resource efficiency for long-duration space missions.</p>

Bublik, known for his unpredictable play, struggled with numerous double faults and unforced errors against the defending champion. Sinner's impressive performance extends his hard-court Grand Slam winning streak to 25 matches. He will now face fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals, marking the first all-Italian men's quarter-final at a major, signaling a strong era for Italian tennis.</p>

These gatherings served as platforms to decry actions by the Trump administration, which organizers assert are weakening unions and negatively impacting workers, while simultaneously benefiting major corporations and the wealthy. The events emphasized the critical need for strengthening worker protections and union representation. Dignitaries such as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass participated, highlighting the ongoing advocacy for labor rights.</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, has highlighted significant accessibility challenges within the Houses of Parliament. She recounted difficulties with heavy doors and inaccessible handles, stating she's had numerous conversations about the issue. Tidball emphasizes the need for Parliament's composition to reflect the 22% disabled voting-age population, advocating for a more inclusive environment. While some changes, like an accessible door in Portcullis House, have been made, a report by the House of Commons Modernisation Committee is expected to propose further reforms to address the building's archaic structures and procedures.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, a century-old landmark in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a benchmark of national park architecture. Opened in 1904, it was advertised as the world's largest log cabin, constructed from 10,000 twisted trees. The inn has hosted presidents and royalty, surviving earthquakes and wildfires, and continues to be meticulously maintained by craftsmen. Its unique design, with wiring bored through logs for modern lighting, was groundbreaking. The article notes that the inn's popularity pioneered the grand lodge style, influencing other iconic national park structures like The Ahwahnee in Yosemite.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just hours after lawyers alerted the court to a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for departure. The Justice Department confirmed 76 children were slated for deportation, all of whom are now being deplaned and returned to Health and Human Services custody. Lawyers argue these deportations bypass legal protections for minors, who could face abuse or persecution upon return.</p>

          <p>British musician Tom Odell experienced a career resurgence, highlighted by his song "Black Friday" becoming a global hit with 700 million streams. He credits a 2016 Hollywood gig, which he considered a "dud," with inspiring Finneas O'Connell and Billie Eilish, who were in the audience, to pursue their own music. This unexpected connection led to Eilish inviting Odell to open her European tour. After years of feeling creatively constrained, Odell went independent in 2021, embracing a more confessional style. His new album, "A Wonderful Life," reflects his personal and global anxieties, finding peace in the moment.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs set a new record for summer transfer spending, surpassing £3 billion, driven by significant deadline day deals.

Key moves included Alexander Isak's British record £125 million transfer to Liverpool. This immense spending highlights the Premier League's financial dominance, with newly promoted clubs also investing heavily to avoid relegation, signaling a growing disparity between the "Big One" league and its European counterparts.

Key acquisitions included Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, the latter for a British record £125 million. However, this period was profoundly affected by the tragic death of beloved Portuguese forward Diogo Jota in a July car crash, necessitating new forward signings amidst the club's immense grief.

Critics are praising Johnson's performance as a "revelation" and "admirably ego-less," suggesting he has reinvented himself as a serious actor.
