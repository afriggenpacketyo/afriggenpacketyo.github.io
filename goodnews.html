        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including Search, Ads, Commerce, Marketing, Research, Communications, and Central Engineering, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the 2023 layoffs. The "voluntary exit program" is available to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are requiring remote workers near offices to adopt hybrid work schedules. This move follows CFO Anat Ashkenazi's October announcement prioritizing cost-cutting measures as Google increases spending on AI infrastructure for 2025, while also overhauling internal learning platforms to focus on AI tool training. Google's Knowledge and Information unit, housing search and ads, has about 20,000 employees and underwent reorganization in October. Optimism in the company's strategy may determine whether or not employees take the buyout. </p>

Bessent described the talks as "productive" and stated that the remaining negotiators will continue discussions as needed with the Chinese delegation, which includes Vice Premier He Lifeng, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang. The discussions are expected to focus on easing U.S. export controls to China in exchange for Beijing's commitment to freeing up its export of rare earth minerals. This marks the second meeting between the two economic superpowers in as many months as they seek to resolve key differences amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI and generative-AI tools is flooding the world with content, making the ability to discern meaningful and resonant variations increasingly valuable. Taste, described as judgment with style, is the instinct that guides decisions on what should be done, shaping culture and reinforcing organizational aspirations. Unlike AI, which mimics styles from vast datasets, taste is cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, representing the human fingerprint on decision-making. As AI takes over mechanical and intellectual labor, the skill of knowing which option to choose becomes crucial, with good taste demanding integrity and ethical awareness, recognizing the difference between edginess and offensiveness.</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that 60% of single American adults believe in love at first sight, a significant increase from 2014, with almost half claiming to have experienced it themselves. This rise is attributed to the prevalence of swipe-based dating apps, which encourage quick judgments and instant connections. Psychologists distinguish between passionate love, the initial rush of infatuation, and compassionate love, which develops over time, noting that quick connections do not guarantee lasting relationships. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey suggests that singles remain optimistic about finding lasting love, with many holding onto destiny beliefs and a desire for extraordinary partnerships.</p>
