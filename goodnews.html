          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a drop in premarket trading after the company was not selected for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index during the latest quarterly rebalance, despite earlier speculation and a Bank of America recommendation. The S&P 500 rebalance is typically a significant event that can trigger substantial trading volume and passive fund investments, as seen with Coinbase's recent inclusion. Despite this setback, Robinhood's stock has doubled in price this year, rebounding from previous losses after the GameStop trading mania and the FTX collapse. The company's shares had reached a new record high last week amid a general recovery in both stocks and crypto markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is advocating for a unified capital markets regulator within the European Union. In a letter to the European Commission, NBIM argues that "better and simpler regulation" is essential for improving the dynamism and investment opportunities in EU markets. The fund, which held 285 billion euros in EU securities at the end of 2024, highlights that the absence of a single regulator leads to legal uncertainty, operational complexity, and inconsistent interpretations. NBIM also calls for addressing regional fragmentation in securities law and standardizing debt issuance processes.</p>

This U-turn, which unfolded over almost a year, began with a controversial policy announcement that drew criticism from Labour MPs. The government now says three-quarters of pensioners will receive the payment and details of who will qualify have been released. The reversal is projected to cost ¬£1.25 billion, raising questions about how the government will finance it and which budgets may be affected.</p>
