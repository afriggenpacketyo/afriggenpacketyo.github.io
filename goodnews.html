          <p>Japan, traditionally a pacifist nation, is shifting its focus towards the global arms export market to strengthen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, attending defense exhibitions and advocating for increased defense spending. This strategic shift aims to bolster Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapon purchases. By exporting arms, Japan hopes to achieve economies of scale and ensure the viability of domestic defense production, especially amid rising global defense demands. The country also aims to address concerns from the U.S. regarding defense spending among allies (not investment advice).</p>

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba highlighted the necessity for the G7 to unite in fostering a free, fair, and rules-based economic order, while maintaining the multilateral free trade regime under the World Trade Organization (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has cautioned that patients recording their medical treatments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram could endanger themselves and NHS staff. The union's annual conference revealed a growing trend of patients filming procedures without consent, potentially distracting staff and compromising patient privacy. Sharing such content online risks exposing the private medical data of others in the vicinity. The SoR emphasizes the need for clear NHS policies to address this issue and protect both patients and healthcare workers.</p>

          <p>Detroit Police Sergeant Shannon Jones has successfully identified 33 missing persons through Operation UNITED, a project involving the exhumation and DNA analysis of unidentified remains. Inspired by photographs of missing loved ones, Jones partnered with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen to locate and exhume bodies buried in "paupers' graves." The FBI's DNA analysis helped match the remains with family members, providing closure and restoring the victims' identities. Kristina Morris, whose father disappeared in 1995, finally learned the truth about his murder thanks to Operation UNITED.</p>

While the deal includes tariff cuts for cars and aerospace products, it does not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports.
