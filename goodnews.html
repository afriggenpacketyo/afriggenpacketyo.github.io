        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's readiness to allow TikTok to be banned in the United States was the crucial factor that prompted China to negotiate a deal. Bessent stated that Trump's firm stance on prioritizing national security over the deal's finalization effectively shifted the dynamics of the talks. The parent company, ByteDance, faces a looming deadline to divest the app's U.S. operations. Bessent mentioned that while commercial terms had been largely settled for months, geopolitical tensions, including U.S. tariffs, had previously stalled the agreement's progress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions that were imposed on certain Hungarian citizens, signaling a warming of diplomatic relations between Washington and Budapest. The previous restrictions, enacted by the Biden administration in 2021, had targeted Hungarian passport holders born outside the country due to security concerns over a simplified naturalization process. These measures reduced the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program. The restoration of the standard two-year validity period follows actions taken by Hungary to address the security vulnerabilities that led to the initial sanctions.</p>

          <p>As of September 15, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,652.25 per ounce, continuing its role as a key commodity for investors. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability and inflation, due to its historical ability to retain value. The article explains that the price of gold is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Currency fluctuations, especially the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks also play a significant role in its market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average mortgage rates recently dropping to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering refinancing. Financial experts suggest that individuals with current mortgage rates above 7% should begin exploring their options, as today's average 30-year refinance rates are around 6.72%. The decision to refinance should be based on personal financial needs, such as improving cash flow or consolidating high-interest debt like credit cards. While waiting could potentially secure even lower rates later in the year, experts warn there's an opportunity cost, as homeowners continue paying higher interest in the interim.

          <h2>Workers Increasingly 'Hug' Their Jobs Amid Economic Uncertainty, Experts Say</h2>

          <p>Amid a cooling job market, a trend of "job hugging" has emerged, with employees clinging to their current positions due to economic uncertainty. The rate of voluntary job separations has fallen to its lowest level since 2016, as weakened job growth makes finding new employment more difficult. Career experts advise that while staying put can feel safer, complacency poses a risk. They recommend that employees who choose to "job hug" should actively seek internal growth opportunities, such as promotions or new skill development, and focus on building their professional networks to be prepared when the hiring market eventually improves.</p>

          <p>China has launched a new Global Governance Initiative (GGI), presenting its most detailed vision yet for reshaping the international system. The initiative, introduced to mark the UN's 80th anniversary, emphasizes inclusive multilateralism and sovereign equality, contrasting with what Beijing views as the United States' unilateral and transactional approach to diplomacy. Experts suggest the GGI reflects China's ambition to foster a multipolar world where developing nations have a greater voice in global decision-making. The move comes at a time of increasing skepticism about the effectiveness and credibility of the current US-led global framework.</p>

Speaking with CNBC, Bessent indicated that he expects further productive talks to occur before a November deadline for the implementation of reciprocal tariffs. He noted that the U.S. trade deficit with China is on pace to decline significantly this year, a key goal of the administration's trade policy. The ongoing negotiations have been complex since President Trump first announced his "liberation day" tariffs, but Bessent believes the Chinese now sense a deal is possible.</p>

          <p>India and the European Union are intensifying efforts to finalize a free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of the year, driven by the need for stable partnerships amid global trade disruptions. The negotiations, which resumed in 2022 after a long hiatus, are gaining momentum as both sides seek to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs and diversify their economic alliances. For India, an FTA would provide crucial tariff-free access for its exports, while the EU aims to strengthen its supply chains and geopolitical presence in the Indo-Pacific. Despite optimism, challenging issues like agricultural tariffs and carbon border adjustments remain.</p>

          <p>The upcoming meeting between King Charles and President Donald Trump continues a tradition of diplomatic encounters between the British Royal Family and U.S. presidents that spans over a century. This article provides a retrospective look at some of the most memorable of these visits, from Woodrow Wilson's post-WWI meeting with King George V to Joe Biden's 2021 visit with the late Queen Elizabeth II. These interactions have often reflected the 'special relationship' between the two nations, though they have also included moments of protocol breaches and political protests. For King Charles, this will be his first time hosting a U.S. president as monarch.</p>
