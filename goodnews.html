          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has reportedly increased its position in Equinix, a leading data center real estate investment trust. The move follows a drop in Equinix's stock price after it announced higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast, which concerned short-term investors. Leveraging its extensive experience with data center businesses, including a successful campaign at Switch, Elliott may push for improved market communication, cost optimization, and financial strategies to enhance long-term shareholder value. The firm could pursue these changes as an active shareholder or potentially seek a board seat. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travel experts suggest that the primary reason for passengers to purchase an early boarding upgrade is to secure overhead bin space for carry-on luggage. As airlines, including Southwest which recently introduced assigned seating, continue to modify their boarding procedures, travelers often face a race for limited storage. While elite status or premium fare classes typically grant priority boarding, those in economy can often buy the perk as an add-on. Co-branded airline credit cards may also offer early boarding benefits, providing an alternative to paying for the upgrade on each flight or purchasing a more expensive ticket.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a bladder cancer diagnosis, football coach Deion Sanders underwent a neobladder reconstruction, a complex surgical procedure detailed by medical experts. The operation involves removing the diseased bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. This method avoids immune system rejection, as the new organ is made from the body's own tissue. While the procedure is innovative, patients must retrain themselves to use the neobladder, and Sanders has publicly discussed the challenges, such as incontinence, to destigmatize the experience for others.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Vox, philosopher Mark C. Taylor explores the changing concept of what it means to be human in an age of climate change and advanced technology. He argues that the modern, anthropocentric view, which separates human consciousness from nature, is at the root of our current environmental crisis. Taylor advocates for a new understanding of humanity based on interconnectedness and relationality, seeing all systems—from biological to ecological—as information-processing networks. He suggests that surviving the future requires moving beyond a mindset of mastery and control and embracing a new, more integrated way of being in the world.</p>

          <p>Millions of Ukrainians who fled the country following Russia's 2022 invasion remain abroad, with many expressing a strong desire to return once the war is over. While over a million have already come back, a recent survey indicates that 43% of those still displaced would like to return to Ukraine. The decision is complex, influenced by factors such as security, job prospects, and family ties, with many facing destroyed homes or a lack of opportunities. Organizations are working to support potential returnees, but the primary obstacle remains the ongoing conflict, with security being the main reason people are hesitant to go back.</p>

          <p>A San Diego man in urgent need of a kidney transplant has found an extraordinarily rare donor match in his wife, Mirna Irish. Jim Irish, 66, required a transplant after complications from procedures on his kidneys, but the odds of his wife being a compatible donor were estimated at one in 100,000. After testing confirmed she was a genetic match, the couple faced further delays due to other health issues, including a cancerous tumor on Jim's remaining kidney. Now cancer-free, the couple is scheduled for the transplant surgery, a gift Mirna calls a blessing that allows her to give life to her husband.</p>

          <p>The Netflix animated film "K-pop Demon Hunters" has become a massive hit in South Korea, where its detailed and authentic portrayal of Korean culture has resonated deeply with audiences. The movie follows a fictional K-pop girl group that secretly fights evil, and its popularity is attributed to its meticulous inclusion of Korean folklore, pop culture references, and everyday mannerisms. Despite being an American production, its success in South Korea highlights the increasingly fluid boundaries of the "K-wave." The film's soundtrack has topped local music charts, and its cultural nods have earned praise for their accuracy and respect for the source material.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted to unionize, joining a growing movement of organized labor in the coffee industry. Workers at three locations in Oakland and one in Berkeley voted 22-to-5 in favor of joining the Blue Bottle Independent Union. This follows a successful unionization effort by the same independent union at six Boston-area stores last year. The workers are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks that were reportedly lost after Nestlé acquired a majority stake in the company in 2017.</p>

          <p>A growing number of professionals are choosing to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen while commuting daily to their jobs in Hong Kong. This cross-border lifestyle is driven by the significant difference in living costs, particularly the high price of rent in Hong Kong. Commuters are trading long travel times, often 90 minutes or more each way, for the ability to afford more spacious living arrangements. This trend is gaining visibility on social media platforms, where individuals share tips on navigating the commute, finding housing in Shenzhen, and managing the daily border crossing.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Dragon capsule has successfully delivered a new international crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station after a 15-hour journey from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The crew includes two NASA astronauts, Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, along with Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov. Their arrival temporarily brings the station's population to eleven. The new crew, who will spend at least six months in orbit, are replacing four colleagues who have been on the ISS since March.

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration enforcement sweeps in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found a "mountain of evidence" that federal tactics were unconstitutional. The original order prohibited agents from using factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being in certain locations as the sole basis for detaining someone. The case was brought by immigrant advocacy groups who accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned individuals, a claim the government's lawyers argued was based on insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Two state-owned Chinese firms are investing a combined US$350 million to develop large-scale agriculture projects in Angola, part of China's broader strategy to enhance its food security. SinoHydro Group will invest over $100 million to create a grain base, with about 60% of the output designated for shipment back to China. Separately, the conglomerate Citic has committed $250 million to develop vast areas for soybean and corn production. These deals underscore China's increasing focus on securing food supplies through overseas agricultural investments, particularly in African nations with significant undeveloped arable land.</p>
