          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has increased its financial outlook for 2025 and surpassed second-quarter expectations, driven by soaring sales of its diabetes and weight loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion, citing strong underlying business performance. However, Eli Lilly's stock saw a premarket dip after data from its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, did not meet high Wall Street expectations. The company's updated guidance accounts for existing tariffs but not potential future levies on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, signaling progress in its turnaround strategy under new CEO Peter Stern. The connected fitness company announced it would cut an additional 6% of its staff to reduce operating expenses by another $100 million, on top of previous cost-saving measures. Despite a 6% drop in sales, the company's net income reached $21.6 million, a significant improvement from the previous year's loss. The results indicate that Peloton's efforts to stabilize its finances are yielding positive results, though it faces headwinds from new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has narrowly voted to reduce its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, continuing a cautious approach to monetary easing. The 5–4 decision reflects a deep division among policymakers, who are balancing persistent inflation against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. While the cut was widely anticipated, the close vote highlights the uncertainty surrounding the UK's economic path. Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized the need to avoid cutting rates too quickly, suggesting future reductions will remain gradual and dependent on disinflationary trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) plans. This move, governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), could significantly change retirement investment strategies for millions of Americans. The decision is seen as a major win for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for greater access to defined-contribution plans.

          <p>The Bank of England's recent decision to lower its interest rate to 4% will have direct consequences for UK households, particularly affecting mortgages and savings accounts. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages are likely to see their monthly payments decrease, offering some financial relief. Conversely, savers will face lower returns on their deposits, as average savings rates are expected to continue their downward trend. The central bank's action is aimed at stimulating spending to manage inflation, which currently stands above the 2% target, while also considering the state of the jobs market.

          <p>Dan Ives, a prominent technology research analyst at Wedbush Securities known for his bullish stock picks and eccentric fashion, is launching a unisex clothing line. The collaboration with Brooklyn-based brand Snow Milk features items like button-down shirts and polos with graffiti-inspired designs. Ives stated that his distinctive clothing style is symbolic of his non-traditional approach to investing and that the fashion line is an extension of that philosophy. With Wall Street's dress codes becoming more flexible, Ives hopes the collection will inspire others to make bold choices in both their wardrobes and their investments.</p>

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China needs to maintain an annual GDP growth rate of at least 4.5% over the next five years. Writing in the Study Times, Professor Cui Youping argued that a rate of "around 5 percent" would be ideal to achieve the country's goal of reaching the per capita GDP of "moderately developed countries" by 2035. This politically significant target, set during the 20th Party Congress, requires substantial and consistent economic expansion. The article also highlighted technological advancement and improving citizens' livelihoods as key priorities for the upcoming 15th five-year plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Seven Financial Habits of the Boomer Generation That Millennials Have Largely Forsaken</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines seven financial practices common among the boomer generation that are not widely adopted by millennials, largely due to different economic realities. These habits include prioritizing buying a home over renting, relying on pensions and Social Security for retirement, and staying with one employer for an entire career. Millennials, having faced multiple economic crises, are adapting with different strategies, such as job-hopping for higher pay and utilizing a wider array of investment tools. The shift reflects a generational divide in financial planning, driven by changes in housing affordability, job security, and retirement systems.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with overall earnings per share falling short of Wall Street expectations. However, the company's revenue exceeded forecasts, climbing 16% to $2.41 billion, largely due to strong performance in its international division and at Tim Hortons. Popeyes was the weakest performer in the portfolio, reporting a decline in same-store sales. Burger King's U.S. division showed modest same-store sales growth, indicating some progress in its ongoing turnaround efforts, while the company reiterated its long-term growth forecast.

          <p>A fabricated story claiming that three senior British military officers were captured by Russian special forces in Ukraine has been debunked as disinformation. The narrative, which spread across social media and was shared by two former British politicians, used demonstrably AI-generated images and featured names of officers who do not exist in UK military records. Experts identify the story as a typical Russian disinformation campaign, designed to be seeded on fringe websites and "laundered" through various channels to create a false sense of credibility. The primary goal is likely to bolster domestic Russian morale and promote the trope of Western puppeteering in the war.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force has successfully completed a perilous, 20-hour medical evacuation of three people from McMurdo Station, an American research base in Antarctica. The mission was conducted in 24-hour darkness and sub-zero temperatures, with the C-130J Hercules crew using night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials, who requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources at the base, described the operation as "nothing short of heroic." Such mid-winter flights are considered extremely challenging due to the harsh and unpredictable Antarctic conditions.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable is pioneering brain-computer interface technology embedded in everyday devices like headphones, which can measure focus and track brain health. Unlike most health trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, these devices use EEG sensors to collect data directly from the brain, potentially detecting issues like cognitive decline years earlier. While the technology does not read thoughts, it can interpret brainwave frequencies to assess attention or restfulness. This innovation points to a future where common wearables could provide real-time insights into our cognitive well-being, a field also being explored by major tech companies.</p>

This push for high-level talks follows a meeting between Putin and a U.S. envoy, as well as a phone call between Zelenskyy, President Trump, and European leaders. Zelenskyy emphasized that Russia must take concrete steps to end its aggression and that any serious negotiation must include European participation. The Kremlin, meanwhile, confirmed that preparations for a Trump-Putin summit are underway, though the prerequisites for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting have not been met.</p>
