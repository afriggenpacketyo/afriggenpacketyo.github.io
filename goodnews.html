          <p>A preliminary 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, causing tremors felt in parts of Georgia and North Carolina. While the U.S. Geological Survey initially reported a lower magnitude, it was later revised upwards. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the shaking, with some describing their homes trembling for several seconds. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, and earthquakes are not uncommon in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, which extends across parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. The article notes that similar tremors occurred in the region in 2018.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, made an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere after failing to reach Venus due to a rocket malfunction. Experts had anticipated that some or all of the half-ton spacecraft might survive the descent, given its construction to withstand Venusian conditions. While the exact location of impact and the extent of debris survival remain unknown, scientists indicated the chances of human injury from falling debris were minimal. The U.S. Space Command monitored the reentry, noting the spacecraft's unique potential for survival compared to typical reentering objects. This article notes that the spacecraft had been stranded in orbit for over half a century.</p>

          <p>Rochester, New York, a midsize city in upstate New York, has become the country's toughest housing market this spring due to its affordability and low inventory. Homes in Rochester typically go under contract within days, often commanding multiple offers above the listing price. Zillow's market heat index ranks Rochester higher than major cities like San Francisco and New York. Despite a population peak in 1950, the city's affordable median home price of $225,000 attracts buyers earning $60,000 to $80,000, while the region faces a persistent shortage of available homes. The article also notes that major employers in healthcare and higher education contribute to the area's economic stability.</p>

          <p>Personal finance expert Ric Edelman is urging for increased financial literacy in America, emphasizing the need for better financial education. Edelman believes the U.S. lacks a strong tradition of encouraging smart personal finance, which is especially concerning given longer lifespans and evolving investment models. He cautions young investors against get-rich-quick schemes and overly complex financial products, and stresses the importance of credible sources for financial information. Edelman advocates for mandatory personal finance courses in high schools, noting that a growing number of states are implementing this requirement. The article also highlights that younger generations are motivated to achieve financial success, learning from their parents' retirement challenges.</p>
