          <p>A strong solar storm has made the aurora borealis visible across the United Kingdom, with sightings reported from Scotland to Kent. Space weather forecasters indicate that the increased solar activity, resulting from a coronal mass ejection, could continue, potentially leading to a G4 severe storm. This heightened activity increases the likelihood of the Northern Lights being visible again, possibly even to the naked eye, across the entire country before activity levels are expected to return to normal.</p>

          <p>Contestants from the second season of "Love is Blind UK" are speaking out about the show's editing and production process. While one couple remains together and describes their post-show life as seamless, others claim their relationships were misrepresented, with key context and positive moments omitted to create on-screen drama. Some cast members also felt challenged by producer requests to recreate conversations for the cameras, suggesting that the final broadcast offers only a partial and sometimes manufactured view of their experiences.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has evolved significantly since its inception as the "Shanghai Five" in 1996, a group focused on regional border security after the Soviet Union's collapse. Initially comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, the bloc was renamed the SCO in 2001 with the addition of Uzbekistan. Over nearly a quarter-century, it has grown into a comprehensive Eurasian organization that now includes 26 countries as members, observers, or dialogue partners, addressing security, economic, and diplomatic challenges across Asia, Europe, and Africa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez as part of a long-term strategy dubbed "Project 150." This plan, championed by CEO Omar Berrada, aims to build a title-contending team by the club's 150th anniversary in 2028. Although Lammens is relatively inexperienced, the club's data analysis rated him highly on key metrics, and the decision reflects a focus on developing future talent rather than acquiring established, older players.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has completed a challenging transfer window by selling star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British record £125 million on deadline day. The sale, which the club had initially resisted, became increasingly necessary after the player expressed his desire to leave. To replace him, Newcastle signed proven Premier League forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford for £55 million, concluding a summer marked by boardroom upheaval and setbacks in securing other high-profile targets, forcing the club to adapt its recruitment strategy.</p>

          <p>Chinese shipping firms, including industry giant Cosco Shipping Holdings, are collaborating with global partners to mitigate the impact of steep new U.S. port fees set to be introduced in October. The companies are strategically reducing their exposure to the U.S. by expanding services in emerging and regional markets, such as those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This pivot is a proactive response to changing market dynamics and trade policies, aiming to find new growth opportunities while navigating the challenges posed by the increased costs of transpacific routes.</p>

          <p>The racquet sport of pickleball is experiencing a surge in popularity in China, with online sales of related equipment increasing more than six-fold in the past year. This growth reflects a broader trend toward active lifestyles and has been boosted by social media influencers and a resurgence of interest in tennis.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to soaring housing prices, Utah's Governor Spencer Cox has set a goal of building 35,000 affordable starter homes within five years. The state has introduced low-interest construction loans to encourage developers, but progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. While some developers are embracing the initiative by building homes priced under $400,000 on smaller lots, housing experts argue that more significant zoning reforms to allow for higher density are needed to truly address the affordability crisis for young and first-time homebuyers.</p>

First elected in 1992, Nadler had a prominent career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as a manager during the first impeachment of former President Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre has developed a potential solution for washing clothes in space: a compact, detergent-free washing machine. The 12kg device uses a fine mist generated from just 400ml of water per cycle to clean clothes. Instead of soap, the machine utilizes ultraviolet light to create ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes the garments, allowing them to be worn multiple times before being discarded, which could significantly improve hygiene and comfort on long-duration space missions.</p>
