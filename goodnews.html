          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially paving the way for their release after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation efforts in prison, swayed by letters from corrections officials supporting their release. While the judge emphasized that he was not suggesting immediate release, he believed they deserved a chance at parole, leaving their fate in the hands of Governor Gavin Newsom and the state parole board. The brothers apologized for their crimes, acknowledging the pain they caused their relatives, while the district attorney's office maintained its opposition, arguing they haven't fully accepted responsibility.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading, rising approximately 2% following the announcement of a 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) share buyback and operating income that surpassed estimates. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year was 203.6 billion yen, exceeding analyst expectations, although it marked an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also disclosed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, with a listing expected this year. The company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March was more subdued, forecasting a slight increase in operating profit due to the impact of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which manage the wealth of ultra-rich individuals, are experiencing rapid growth but are struggling to find qualified money managers. The demand for personalized financial services has increased, but a shortage of skilled advisors is making it difficult for family offices to recruit and retain staff. This talent crunch is due to both a lack of qualified candidates and the selectivity of family offices, which prioritize trust above all else. Some families are willing to pay a premium for trusted individuals, but the informal structure and unclear career progression within family offices make them less appealing to younger employees.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April for the first time in months, decreasing to an average of $5.12 per dozen after reaching a record $6.23 in March. Despite this drop, egg prices remain significantly higher than the previous year due to the ongoing outbreak of bird flu, which has wiped out numerous egg-laying hens. Experts predict that egg prices will continue to decline in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the Department of Justice is investigating Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer.</p>

          <p>Scientists have documented wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, demonstrating a form of "forest first aid." The research, conducted in the Budongo Forest, builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate by eating certain plants. The chimpanzees were observed dabbing plants on wounds and applying chewed plant material to injuries, and researchers also found records of chimps tending to the wounds of others. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to maintain their health in the wild and suggests a capacity for empathy in chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>President Trump was given a warm and opulent welcome by the Saudi crown prince, reflecting the amity between a royal family and presidential family with diplomatic and business alliances. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, gave Mr. Trump the royal treatment. Mr. Trump was escorted through Saudi airspace by three F-15 fighter jets flanking each side of Air Force One. The presidential limousine was accompanied to the Royal Court in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, by riders on Arabian horses.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after 35 years behind bars for the murders of their parents. The decision follows a recommendation from former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n, who cited their rehabilitation efforts and the abuse they suffered. The brothers addressed the judge, acknowledging their crimes and apologizing for their actions. The parole process will be lengthy and could take years, with their next court appearance for the clemency case scheduled for June 13.</p>
