          <p>The U.S. Army's Caisson Detachment has resumed its ceremonial duties at Arlington National Cemetery after a two-year suspension and a $28 million overhaul. The program was halted in May 2023 due to concerns about the living conditions and care of the horses. An investigation revealed inadequate stables, poor quality feed, and untreated illnesses, leading to the deaths of several horses. The Army has since renovated the stables, improved horse care practices, and brought in equine experts to ensure the well-being of the animals and the continuation of this historic tradition.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how much one can expect to receive each month from an annuity at various investment amounts and ages. Annuity payouts depend on factors such as the amount invested, the age when payments start, and life expectancy, with payouts varying based on gender. The article provides tables illustrating potential monthly payments for different investment amounts and ages, emphasizing that these are estimates for single-life immediate fixed annuities. It also notes that current interest rates and choices like joint-life annuities or inflation protection can impact the monthly payout (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound in morning trading, recovering some of the losses incurred after a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock had closed down 14% on Thursday following the heated exchange, which included Trump threatening to remove government contracts from Musk's companies. Despite the initial investor unease, analysts remain optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly its advancements in autonomous technology. Musk's net worth also took a hit, plunging $34 billion due to the stock's decline.</p>

          <p>Tesla stock experienced a 5% increase Friday as it sought to recover from a market rout triggered by the conflict between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The previous day's turmoil had erased $152 billion from the company's market capitalization. Analysts suggest that the underlying strength of Tesla's investor base remains resilient, with some anticipating a potential truce between Musk and Trump. Musk had publicly criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures.</p>

          <p>The stock market is rebounding, driven by a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, with the U.S. economy adding 139,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%. Hourly wages also increased by 3.9% year-over-year, surpassing expectations. This report eased investor concerns following recent suboptimal labor market data. The U.S. economy's reliance on private consumption makes a stable labor market crucial for sustained growth. The jobs data wasn't weak enough to signal an imminent recession, but also not too strong to preclude Federal Reserve rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

While President Trump's tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly affect used car sales, they can influence the used car market by impacting new vehicle prices and demand.
