          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a spot in the US Open semi-finals by defeating Australia's Alex de Minaur in a challenging four-set match. The victory marks Auger-Aliassime's first Grand Slam semi-final appearance since 2021, while de Minaur continues to seek a breakthrough beyond the quarter-final stage at major tournaments. The match was characterized by a high number of errors and double faults from both players, with Auger-Aliassime acknowledging that nerves played a significant role. He is now set to face either Jannik Sinner or Lorenzo Musetti in his next match for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cancel $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs determined that the administration used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" to improperly terminate the grants, stating the move was more related to the president's "power and political views." The judge's order criticized the administration for jeopardizing decades of research and disregarding constitutional rights like free speech and academic freedom. However, the ruling also noted that Harvard has been "plagued by antisemitism" and should have handled the issue better on its campus.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the "Restore Trust in Congress Act," is gaining momentum in the U.S. House of Representatives, aiming to prohibit members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from trading or owning individual stocks. The legislation combines several previous proposals and has garnered support from a wide political spectrum, including Representatives Chip Roy and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Proponents argue the ban is necessary to eliminate perceived conflicts of interest and restore public trust, stating it is "crazy" that lawmakers are permitted to trade stocks while in office. While House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed general support for a ban, the bill still faces opposition from some who believe it would deter experienced individuals from the private sector from running for office.

This is a substantial increase from the initial target of $6 billion. The sale will be conducted at a formidable $500 billion valuation, a notable rise from the company's $300 billion valuation earlier in the year. This move allows employees to realize some of their equity gains without the company needing to go public, a strategy also used by other high-value tech startups.

          <p>Democratic groups in North Carolina have successfully negotiated an agreement to prevent approximately 98,000 voters from being disenfranchised. The deal settles a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had sought to block individuals who registered without providing a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. The state's Republican-led election board was prepared to comply before the Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the move violated the National Voter Registration Act. Under the new agreement, affected voters will be able to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue and allowing their vote to be counted.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters soared over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and reinstated its full-year guidance. The company credited its recent marketing campaigns, particularly a successful, though controversial, partnership with actress Sydney Sweeney, for driving customer acquisition and sales. CEO Jay Schottenstein noted a positive start to the fall season, fueled by stronger product offerings and increased brand engagement from campaigns with Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce. The strong performance marks a turnaround for the retailer, which had previously struggled with merchandising missteps and tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's shares closed 20% higher after the department store chain reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed analyst expectations and raised its full-year guidance. The company cited improved sales trends, particularly in its 125 revamped "focus" stores, as a key driver of its success. CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, noting that while tariff impacts are real, the company is well-positioned with a resilient consumer, a healthy inventory, and growth across all its brands, including Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. The positive results mark a notable turnaround from the previous quarter when Macy's had slashed its guidance amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of gold surging to a new all-time high of around $3,549 per ounce, investors who purchased gold bars from retailers like Costco have seen significant unrealized gains. A one-ounce gold bar bought from Costco in September 2024 for $2,679 would now be worth approximately $870 more, representing a 32.5% increase before fees and taxes. Gold's appeal is growing amid economic uncertainty, ongoing wars, and inflation concerns, serving as a "fear hedge" for portfolios. However, sellers should expect to receive 5% to 10% below the spot price from dealers and will face taxes on their profits, as the IRS classifies physical gold as a collectible.

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered the remains of a unique ankylosaur named Spicomellus, which lived over 165 million years ago and was covered in an extraordinary array of spikes and bony armor. The fossil reveals that the car-sized herbivore had meter-long spikes on its neck, large spikes over its hips, and ribs fused with outward-projecting spikes—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting they developed complex armor much earlier than believed. Scientists theorize the elaborate structure was used for both defense and attracting mates, highlighting the significance of African dinosaur fossils in understanding their evolution.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a New York judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing evidence can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This is the first time such cutting-edge forensic technology, known as whole genome sequencing, has been deemed admissible in a New York State court, setting a major legal precedent. Prosecutors used the method to connect Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab that conducted the tests is not licensed in New York, but the decision is seen as a significant victory for the prosecution in this high-profile case.</p>
