          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has predicted the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week, suggesting moderate Democrats may soon vote to reopen the government. Hassett stated that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown stems from a partisan conflict over federal funding, with Democrats demanding the inclusion of extended Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap bill. This article highlights the administration's perspective on the political dynamics and potential paths to ending the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding provides five key strategies for employees dealing with a "control freak" boss to conserve energy and improve workplace dynamics. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other tactics involve preempting criticism by asking for initial thoughts and explicitly requesting positive feedback to foster a more balanced professional relationship. The article aims to empower employees to navigate challenging managerial styles without becoming frustrated or exhausted.</p>

          <p>Steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business, causing its shares to surge by approximately 17%. CEO Lourenco Goncalves noted that geological surveys at two company sites in Michigan and Minnesota show potential for these critical minerals. This strategic move aligns with the national goal of achieving material independence from China, which currently dominates the global rare earth supply chain. The minerals are vital for manufacturing magnets used in electric vehicles, defense systems, and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

The monarch expressed his sadness over the incident and spoke with three individuals who were injured, including a volunteer security guard and another man mistakenly shot by police. The visit was seen by the local Jewish community as a significant gesture of support from the highest level of the country. One survivor commented that while the attack showed the worst of humanity, the subsequent support has shown the best.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles generally depreciate at a faster rate than their internal combustion engine counterparts, losing about 13% more value over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include higher initial government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale values. Additionally, the rapid advancement of EV technology, particularly in battery range, makes older models less desirable to value-oriented used car buyers. However, the market is expected to change as a wider variety of more affordable EV models become available, potentially stabilizing their long-term value.</p>

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not automatically available to everyone and involves a specific approval process. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with income below the median typically qualify easily, while those above must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The article also outlines other requirements, such as recent filing history and mandatory credit counseling, and discusses alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement if an application is denied.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate candidate supported by left-wing parties, has won the Turkish Cypriot leadership election with a decisive 62.8% of the vote.

Erhurman's campaign also emphasized preserving the secular identity of the Turkish Cypriot community against perceived interference from Ankara. The election result has been welcomed by Greek Cypriot leaders, who see it as an opportunity to restart long-stalled peace talks.</p>

          <p>Amid significant market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies for greater stability. Burrello explains that these funds offer more structural protection because their performance is not reliant on traditional stock correlations and can provide income that is insensitive to interest rate changes. He highlights funds like the Invesco QQQ Income Advantage ETF as examples that can offer downside protection. This approach is presented as a way to generate income without depending on Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Economist's third annual "Carrie Bradshaw Index" has identified the most affordable U.S. cities for single-person households, with Wichita, Kansas, ranking at the top. The index calculates affordability based on the rule that rent for a studio apartment should not exceed 30% of a person's gross income. In Wichita, the median wage is 75% higher than what is needed to afford an average studio. The report noted a trend of previously affordable cities, particularly in Texas, becoming unaffordable due to rising rents, increasing the total number of unaffordable cities in the index from 38 to 41 this year.</p>

This has led to speculation about which firms might receive government backing, similar to a deal struck with MP Materials in July.
