          <p>This article discusses the political climate in countries allied with the United States, suggesting a preference for stability over the disruptive policies reminiscent of Donald Trump's earlier administration. It highlights a public clash between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, reflecting a broader concern about the impact of disruptive leadership on economic and political landscapes. The article posits that voters in allied nations are wary of repeating the perceived mistakes of the past, opting instead for leaders and policies that promise a more predictable and secure future.

          <p>Donald Trump has announced a news conference to reveal a "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country," leading to speculation that the agreement is with the United Kingdom. Several US media outlets have reported that the US will strike a trade agreement with the UK. This would be the first such agreement since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, later pausing the levies for 90 days. The UK is also subject to US import taxes on steel, aluminum, and cars, but Washington is reportedly close to similar deals with India and Israel.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is anticipated to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, marking his administration's first such deal since imposing tariffs last month. Specifics remain unclear, and neither the White House nor the British embassy has commented. Discussions have included lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as reducing British taxes on US technology companies. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has prioritized an agreement with the EU, potentially complicating negotiations due to differing standards on food production.</p>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is teaching an online writing course, raising ethical questions about using digital prosthetics of deceased individuals. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, uses a script written by academic researchers based on Christie's writings and archival interviews, with AI generating her likeness. While Christie's family supports the project and emphasizes that it uses her own words, some experts argue that it is still a deepfake and raises concerns about consent and authenticity.

          <p>Chinese researchers are utilizing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world‚Äôs largest radio telescope and an advanced radar system, to search for water ice at the moon‚Äôs south pole. The team estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil, existing as fragmented chunks buried deep underground. The findings are intended to aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a proposed China-led research base on the moon. The use of China‚Äôs newly built incoherent scatter radar in Sanya (SYISR) alongside the FAST telescope is being hailed as a creative approach.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. publicly defended the independence of the judiciary, denouncing attempts to impeach judges over disagreements with their rulings. His remarks, made at an event in Buffalo, echoed a similar statement he issued in March in response to threats from President Trump and his allies. The comments come amid scrutiny of federal judges overseeing cases challenging administration policies and follow a recent denouncement of attacks on the judiciary by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>
