          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback. The company's operating income for the last three months surpassed analyst estimates, though it decreased by 11% compared to the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, with shareholders receiving over 80% of the shares through dividends. While the outlook for the current financial year was somewhat lackluster due to anticipated impacts from trade policies, Sony clarified that recent trade deals could significantly alter the actual tariff impact.

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as ultra-rich individuals seek personalized wealth management services; however, these offices struggle to find qualified money managers. Despite projections of significant growth in the number of family offices and assets under their management, McKinsey predicts a potential shortage of wealth advisors in the coming years. Family offices face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent, and they often prioritize trust over other qualifications when hiring. European family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent by offering bonuses and co-investment opportunities.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from multiple countries overseeing the process. President Trump has stated that a diplomatic resolution with Iran would make the region safer, though it remains unclear if Saudi Arabia and the UAE are interested in such a venture.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decrease in April, marking the first decline in months, yet they remain near record highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs fell to $5.12 after reaching $6.23 in March, with the overall average price of eggs decreasing by 12.7%. Despite this decrease, egg prices are still significantly higher than the previous year, and experts predict that prices may continue to fluctuate depending on the progression of the bird flu virus. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer, amid these price fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Uganda have observed wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants in various ways to treat wounds and injuries, adding to evidence that primates self-medicate in the wild. The researchers documented instances of chimps applying plants to their own wounds and occasionally to others, building on previous findings that chimps eat certain plants for their healing properties. This research also highlights the capacity for empathy among wild chimpanzees, as they tend to the wounds of unrelated individuals. The study compiled decades of scientific observations, revealing hygiene habits and other behaviors related to self-care.</p>
