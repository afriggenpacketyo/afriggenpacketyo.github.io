          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has open-sourced two of its Pangu series artificial intelligence models to accelerate AI adoption and expand its global ecosystem. This strategy aims to incentivize the use of other Huawei products, particularly its Ascend AI chips, which are considered China's primary competitor to restricted high-end chips from Nvidia. By making the models available for customization, Huawei hopes to strengthen its position across the entire AI value chain, especially in developing nations where its price-sensitive products resonate well.</p>
