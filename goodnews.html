        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will not impose tariffs on gold, overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have subjected certain gold bars to a 39% duty. The initial ruling, which specifically targeted 1kg and 100oz bars from Switzerland, had caused the precious metal to reach a record high. Following Trump's announcement on social media, gold futures experienced a significant drop, closing over 2.4% lower. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that the customs ruling could have affected gold imports from all countries, not just Switzerland.</p>

          <p>More than two years after declaring bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is returning with a new physical store concept called Bed Bath & Beyond Home, opening first in Nashville. The relaunch is managed by The Brand House Collective, which aims to revive the iconic retailer with a tighter focus on home decor, bedroom, and bath products. To attract loyal customers, the new store will honor the brand's well-known legacy coupons, a move intended to re-engage its former consumer base. While this marks a significant step in the brand's turnaround effort, analysts note the company still faces considerable financial challenges in a competitive retail landscape.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery. The theater chain posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million, or one cent per share, a significant improvement from the previous year. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive results to a recovering industry-wide box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company also highlighted its success in managing its debt, pushing maturities to 2029, and achieving record-high revenue per patron, driven by growth in premium offerings.</p>

It frames the decision as a way to convert a primary asset into usable, tax-free funds for greater financial flexibility during retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally following a report that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. Trump confirmed he is looking into the matter and expects to make a decision in the coming weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III would ease tax burdens and likely encourage institutional investment in the cannabis industry. While the final decision rests with the Attorney General, the president's public consideration of the issue has generated optimism for a market-altering policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will end its dial-up internet service on September 30, marking the conclusion of a technology that defined an era of early internet access. The company, now owned by Yahoo, stated the decision was part of a routine evaluation of its products to meet the needs of the modern digital landscape. While only about 163,000 U.S. households still used dial-up in 2023, the service's distinctive screeching connection tone and "You've Got Mail" greeting are memorable for millions. The discontinuation will not affect free AOL email accounts or other services offered by the company.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the strategic differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities for retirement savings. IRAs are presented as investment accounts offering growth potential and flexibility, ideal for younger savers comfortable with market risk. In contrast, annuities are described as insurance products that provide guaranteed income, appealing to those nearing retirement who prioritize security and predictability over potential growth. The piece suggests that for many, the optimal strategy may be a hybrid approach, using an IRA for wealth accumulation and later converting a portion into an annuity to create a stable income floor.

          <p>The White House confirmed an unusual deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of their China-bound AI chip revenue with the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. Analysts view this as a transactional, tariff-like move characteristic of the Trump administration, securing continued market access for the companies while asserting national economic interests. While investors see it as a net positive for the chipmakers, who can now sell to the lucrative Chinese market, it raises long-term uncertainty about future government demands. The deal underscores the strategic importance of semiconductors in the U.S.-China tech rivalry and is unlikely to be replicated in other sectors.</p>

          <p>The online retail landscape is on the verge of a major shift as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are expected to integrate direct checkout functionalities. This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface, bypassing the need to visit a merchant's website. This evolution could streamline the sales cycle but also poses a disruptive threat to the existing e-commerce model, particularly for platforms like Amazon that monetize user attention through ads. While payment processors like PayPal and Apple Pay could be impacted, the biggest change may be the shift in power to AI platforms that control the initial product discovery phase.</p>

          <p>Lithium-related stocks, including U.S. miner Albemarle, saw a significant surge after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The suspension was due to an expired permit, and the company is working to renew it and resume operations. This specific mine accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecasted for 2025. The temporary shutdown has tightened an already constrained market, causing investors to anticipate a rise in lithium prices due to the reduced supply, which in turn boosted the value of mining stocks.</p>
