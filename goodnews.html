          <h2>The Perils of Outsourcing Parenting to Artificial Intelligence Tools</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues against the growing trend of AI tools in parenting, such as party planners, lunchbox note translators, and AI-guided storytelling apps. While these tools promise to simplify tasks for overwhelmed parents, the author contends that outsourcing such intimate aspects of child-rearing risks eroding the essential human connection and intimacy between parents and children. Relying on AI can lead to a loss of "tacit knowledge" about a child's unique needs and may foster an unhealthy "do-it-all" model of parenthood, rather than encouraging parents to trust their instincts or seek support from their human community. Ultimately, AI threatens to sap the humanness from the parenting experience.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planner has signaled a crucial "policy window" for implementing stronger support measures for the private sector, openly acknowledging the need for significant improvements in the country's business environment. An official article in the People's Daily called for bolstering the protection of property rights, regulating law enforcement concerning enterprises, and enhancing government services. This strategic move aims to stabilize market sentiment and reinvigorate investor confidence, building upon a law passed earlier this year that ensures equal legal treatment for non-state firms. The government's proactive stance reflects a keen desire to address existing concerns and cultivate a more favorable and stable climate for private enterprises amidst ongoing economic challenges.

          <p>This article delves into the complex ethical questions surrounding embryo selection and genetic testing, such as PGT-A and newer polygenic testing, which promise to screen for conditions and even enhance traits like IQ or height. While parents naturally desire a healthier child, the article cautions against the "eugenics-y" implications and potential psychological harm of commodifying children. It highlights scientific limitations, like pleiotropy, where genes affect multiple traits, and warns of the dangers of "maximizing" single values, potentially leading to a less diverse world or unequal access based on wealth. The article encourages parents to resist external pressure and make "good enough" choices that align with their family's values.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the growing phenomenon of unhappiness and loneliness among young, unpartnered men, challenging traditional stereotypes of content bachelors. Research indicates that single men are often less satisfied with their lives than single women and more actively seek committed relationships. The article attributes this to rigid masculine norms that discourage emotional expression, leading men to often view romantic partners as their sole emotional outlet. This tendency can hinder both platonic and romantic relationships, contributing to a lack of social support. The article suggests that embracing vulnerability and diverse connections, rather than adhering to outdated masculine ideals, could lead to greater emotional fulfillment and happiness.</p>

          <p>A UCLA annual survey challenges the long-held "NIMBY" perception in Los Angeles, revealing that a clear majority of Angelenos actually support building more housing, including apartments in single-family neighborhoods and their own communities. The data indicates 86% support apartments in at least one setting, with 64% supporting them on single-family streets and 59% in their own neighborhoods. This widespread consensus presents an opportunity for city leaders to expand affordable housing initiatives like Executive Directive 1 and prioritize data-driven policy over vocal minority opinions. The article suggests Los Angeles has a rare moment of agreement on its housing crisis, urging leaders to act on this public support.</p>
