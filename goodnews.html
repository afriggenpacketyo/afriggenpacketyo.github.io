          <p>While excavating in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a well-preserved mummy estimated to be 1,000 years old, predating the Inca Empire. The remains, found just 20 inches underground, are believed to belong to a woman from the Chancay culture and were notable for still having intact dark brown hair. Archaeologists noted that such discoveries are not uncommon in Lima, a city with hundreds of archaeological sites, due to the region's dry desert climate which naturally mummifies remains.</p>

This perspective emerges as stablecoins become a central topic in global economic discussions. (not investment advice)</p>
