          <h2>Mark Zuckerberg Outlines Vision for 'Personal Superintelligence' Amidst Billions in AI Investment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 13:53:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled his vision for "personal superintelligence," positioning it as a tool for individual empowerment rather than solely for automating work. This strategic announcement precedes Meta's second-quarter earnings report, where investors will scrutinize the company's substantial spending on AI talent. Meta has invested billions, including $14.3 billion in Scale AI and the establishment of Meta Superintelligence Labs, to advance its foundation models like the Llama series. The article provides context by recalling Zuckerberg's prior, costly commitment to the metaverse, which has incurred over $60 billion in losses, highlighting the high stakes in this new technological frontier.</p>

          <p>CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell's upcoming book, "We the Women," aims to shed light on forgotten female pioneers from 1776 to the present. O'Donnell shared on "CBS Mornings" that her research uncovered figures like Mary Katharine Goddard, a printer who risked treason to produce the Declaration of Independence, a fact she previously didn't know. The book also features Katharine Wright and Emily Warren Roebling, highlighting their monumental bravery and grit during times when women had few rights. O'Donnell hopes the article's insights inspire young girls, portraying these women as "true revolutionaries" whose achievements would have gone viral today.</p>

          <p>WWE star Alexa Bliss, who recently returned to the ring, discussed the possibility of a program with the eerie Wyatt Sicks faction, formed after the death of Bray Wyatt. Bliss, who had a famous on-screen connection with Wyatt, expressed that Windham Rotunda (Bray Wyatt's real name) always believed they would reconnect in a significant way. While currently enjoying her tag-team dynamic with Charlotte Flair, Bliss acknowledges the fan speculation and interest in her joining the Wyatt Sicks. She maintains a piece of Bray's character in her attire, keeping the connection alive for fans, and will vie for the women’s tag-team championship at SummerSlam.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged corporate America, investors, and U.S. trade partners to remain calm despite the looming August 1 deadline for potential tariff rate surges. Bessent clarified that even if new trade deals aren't finalized by then, negotiations can still proceed, implying any higher tariff rates might be temporary. He framed President Trump's August 1 deadline as a strategic negotiating tool, designed to pressure countries into accepting increased tariff rates while simultaneously opening their domestic markets to U.S. products. This statement foreshadows a potentially intense period of trade talks following the deadline, as numerous countries have yet to ink agreements.</p>

          <p>Despite Starbucks reporting weaker-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and a sixth consecutive quarter of shrinking same-store sales, Wall Street analysts are observing early indications of a turnaround. Analysts point to sequential monthly improvements in traffic, particularly from non-loyalty members, and CEO Brian Niccol's assertion that the "Back to Starbucks" strategy is ahead of schedule. Accelerated rollout of "Green Apron Service" and mobile app changes, alongside teased new menu items for fiscal 2026, are cited as reasons for cautious optimism. However, the article notes that not all investors are convinced, as the comeback is taking longer than initially anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tsunami warnings across Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Canada have been largely downgraded or removed after a powerful earthquake near Russia. While Hawaiians heeded evacuation advice, Governor Josh Green reported no "wave of consequence," despite crests of nearly six feet. Authorities continue to advise caution due to the risk of strong currents persisting for hours or days. The article highlights how residents, particularly in Maui, treated the warning seriously given past natural disasters, and how smaller waves were recorded along the North American Pacific coast.

          <p>This article explores whether seniors receiving Social Security should consider purchasing annuities to bolster their retirement income amidst concerns about inflation, rising healthcare costs, and Social Security's long-term sustainability. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income, providing diversification and protection against outliving savings, especially for those without a pension. However, they require a lump sum, reduce liquidity, and can be complex with various fees. The article advises evaluating personal goals, health, and risk tolerance, suggesting that while annuities can provide stability for risk-averse individuals expecting longevity, delaying Social Security for increased benefits might be a better alternative for some.

          <p>The U.S. multifamily rental market is experiencing a significant shift, with national vacancy rates reaching a record 7.1% in July on Apartment List's index, and median rents remaining unchanged from June. This trend is attributed to a massive surge in new apartment supply, with over 600,000 units hitting the market last year. While construction is expected to slow, the market remains overbuilt relative to demand, leading to longer leasing times. Rent declines are most pronounced in formerly hot markets like Austin, Denver, and Phoenix, while San Francisco, Fresno, and Chicago show gains. The article notes that macroeconomic uncertainty, partly due to Trump administration tariffs, has modestly dampened demand. (not investment advice)</p>

This move aims to penetrate the identity security market, which CEO Nikesh Arora described as hitting an inflection point, especially with the rise of agentic AI. Arora believes CyberArk adds a crucial missing piece to Palo Alto's comprehensive cybersecurity platform, noting overlapping customers but no overlapping products, facilitating cross-selling.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant surge in the second quarter, with GDP increasing at an annual rate of 3%, a turnaround from the 0.5% contraction in the first three months of the year. This growth was largely driven by a substantial decline in imports, a factor influenced by President Trump's trade policies. While the headline figure appears robust, economists note that "final sales to private domestic purchasers" rose by only 1.2%, indicating a weakening underlying demand. The article highlights that despite the surge, the economy's average growth rate for the first half of 2025 remains slower than the previous year, with inflationary pressures still present.
