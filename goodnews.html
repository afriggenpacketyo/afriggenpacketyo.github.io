        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler holds a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final day of The Open Championship at Royal Portrush. A bogey-free third round of 67, including an eagle, positioned him at 14 under par, significantly ahead of his closest competitor, Li Haotong. A victory would mark Scheffler's third major championship and move him closer to a career Grand Slam, a feat few have achieved before the age of 30. Despite strong early charges from Rory McIlroy and others, Scheffler's consistent performance has made him the clear favorite.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:07:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club since last December. The deal is expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, which is financially advantageous for the cash-strapped Spanish champions. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is seeking to strengthen its attack after failing to sign other targets. The article examines the motivations for both clubs and questions whether the 27-year-old English forward can rediscover his top form and truly enhance Barcelona's already potent offense.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated Australia 27-19 in their first Test match in Brisbane, starting the series with a convincing win. The Lions established a dominant early lead, scoring three tries to go up 24-5 shortly after halftime, with fly-half Finn Russell orchestrating the attack effectively. However, the performance leveled off in the final 30 minutes as substitutions disrupted their momentum, allowing Australia to score two late tries. While the victory was secure, analysts noted the flat atmosphere and drop in intensity, suggesting the Lions have more to give in the upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>On the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, this article revisits the 'Operation Valkyrie' plot led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The bomb planted in a briefcase failed to kill Hitler, leading to the coup's rapid collapse and the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. Historians reflect on the reasons for its failure, including a lack of support from high-ranking military leaders. The legacy of the plotters has evolved over time, from being seen as traitors to being honored as heroes of the German resistance, despite historical debate over their democratic ideals.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million, according to a recent SEC filing. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan adopted in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale comes as Nvidia's market capitalization has soared past $4 trillion, driven by intense demand for its AI-powering chips. The company also announced it expects to resume sales of its H20 chips to China soon, following indications of export license approval from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than originally expected. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. While initially projected to miss around six weeks, manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism for a much sooner return. Muncy's absence has been felt by the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled recently, making his speedy and effective rehabilitation crucial for the team as they look to regain their form in the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships was finally awarded their gold medals during a ceremony at the London Diamond League meeting. The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the winning U.S. team was disqualified. The disqualification followed a 2008 confession from U.S. runner Antonio Pettigrew that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. The belated ceremony provided the athletes a moment of recognition in front of a large home crowd, 28 years after the original race.</p>

          <p>The early phase of the earnings season, combined with moderate inflation data, has provided some support for the market, though concerns about potential tariffs persist. While some major companies like Wells Fargo and Abbott Labs saw initial negative stock reactions to their reports, a deeper look reveals underlying strengths and strategic shifts. For example, BlackRock's results, initially viewed as a miss, were later re-evaluated more positively due to strong organic growth. The article suggests that initial market reactions can be short-sighted and that navigating the current economic moment requires a nuanced view of corporate performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway asserts that the worst career advice often given by billionaires is to "follow your passion." He argues that this advice is typically given by those who are already wealthy and that a more practical approach is to find something you are good at that can also be financially viable. Galloway's own journey involved abandoning a passion for athletics for a career in business and entrepreneurship. The article suggests that success comes from combining talent with opportunity and being resilient enough to endure rejection and pivot when necessary.</p>
