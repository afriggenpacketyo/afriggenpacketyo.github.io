          <p>House Republicans are proposing an expansion of the child tax credit, aiming to make the $2,000 credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. The plan would also require both parents to have a Social Security number to claim the credit. However, critics point out that the proposal would exclude millions of children from low-income families and those with immigrant parents, potentially taking the credit away from 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present, while middle-income families would see the biggest benefit.</p>
