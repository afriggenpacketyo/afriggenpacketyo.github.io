          <p>Pakistan has taken on the rotating one-month presidency of the UN Security Council, a role it will hold for the eighth time in its history. The position is largely symbolic but comes during a period of significant global instability and heightened geopolitical tensions. Pakistan's UN Ambassador stated the country would work cooperatively to promote peaceful conflict resolution, though it is expected to raise the recent conflict with India over Kashmir. Meanwhile, India is reportedly preparing a counter-strategy focusing on its economic strength and highlighting issues of cross-border terrorism.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the French film industry for its general failure to depict the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, contrasting it with Hollywood productions like "12 Years a Slave." The author notes that despite France having the second-largest colonial empire, these stories remain largely invisible in the country's collective imagination. The piece highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" as rare exceptions that are finally bringing these narratives to the screen. However, it laments that such films are often marginalized and struggle for mainstream recognition, even as audiences show a readiness to engage with this complex history.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since last November and is projected to continue its appreciation through 2025. The currency gained 1.86% in the first half of the year, driven by resilient macroeconomic data that has shifted investor sentiment. According to Goldman Sachs analysts, concerns over the sustainability of US government debt and fading confidence in American economic exceptionalism are also contributing to the dollar's relative weakness. The investment bank forecasts the yuan will break the 7 per dollar mark within six months, reflecting a more optimistic near-term growth outlook for China. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the need for emerging nations to develop "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. This concept refers to a country's ability to control its own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure, rather than relying on English-centric models from major tech companies. Experts suggested that the ASEAN region is well-positioned for this shift, and that leveraging open-source AI models and democratized access to cloud computing can empower local talent. This approach aims to create a more inclusive global AI landscape and prevent the benefits of the technology from being concentrated in just a few nations.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, indicating expansion, which analysts attribute to a delayed positive response to a U.S.-China tariff reduction announced in May. The survey, which focuses more on smaller, export-oriented firms, noted that improved trade conditions and promotional activities boosted new orders and production. However, new export orders continued to decline and employment in the sector remained weak, suggesting potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two tropical systems have been impacting Mexico's coasts, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. Tropical Storm Flossie, located off the country's southwest coast, strengthened into a hurricane on Monday night but is expected to remain over open water. It is forecast to bring several inches of rain to states like Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Guerrero. On the opposite coast, Tropical Storm Barry made landfall as a tropical depression near Tampico and was rapidly weakening as it moved inland. Forecasters warned of significant rainfall and potential flooding across several eastern Mexican states from Barry's remnants.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills aimed at speeding up construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which Newsom pushed through by tying it to the state budget, exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews that often cause delays and litigation. The move sidestepped demands from some powerful labor groups for broader wage requirements, applying them only to high-rise and low-income developments. Experts believe the new laws could represent the most consequential changes to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unlocking numerous stalled housing projects.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for California's wildfire season. The troops were federalized by President Trump to address protests, a controversial move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was illegal and depleted firefighting resources. The state had previously warned that the deployment left its Guard-based firefighting force at only 40% capacity ahead of an expected early and active fire season. The proposal to reassign some troops comes amid an ongoing legal battle between the state and the Trump administration over control of the Guard.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound, betaine, that is produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise and plays a key role in slowing the aging process. Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs. It achieves this by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with the body's inflammatory response. These findings help explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and may lead to new strategies that simulate its effects.</p>

Jassy framed the shift as an opportunity to free employees from "rote work" and make their jobs more interesting and inventive.
