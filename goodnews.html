          <p>Actor Sacha Baron Cohen has surprised fans by revealing a significantly more muscular physique in a photoshoot for Men's Fitness UK. The transformation is in preparation for his role as the villain Mephisto in Marvel's upcoming miniseries, "Ironheart." Cohen humorously commented on his new look on social media, joking about his methods and debuting a new character persona of a middle-aged man focused on fitness. The reveal comes amid personal changes for the actor, following his recent divorce from Isla Fisher and public disputes with actress Rebel Wilson over on-set conduct allegations.</p>

          <p>The number of job postings mentioning artificial intelligence has surged, according to a report from the Brookings Institution, indicating a growing demand for AI-skilled workers. Over the past year, AI-themed job listings have more than doubled as companies increasingly integrate the technology into their operations. These roles range from specialized AI engineers to more general positions in software development, consulting, and ethics. While currently a small fraction of the overall labor market, these jobs often command higher salaries, with AI skills correlating to an average pay increase of 28%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Stock Surges, Becoming Latest Meme Stock After Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 13:27:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant jump, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge followed the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and gained traction among retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The stock is a candidate for such volatile trading due to its high short interest, with over 13% of its shares being bet against by institutional investors. This activity provides a temporary boost for the company's stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date prior to the rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has released the public beta for iOS 26, its next major software update for the iPhone, allowing users to preview significant changes ahead of the official fall release. The update introduces a new design aesthetic called "Liquid Glass," which is the most substantial visual overhaul since 2013, featuring translucent and animated interface elements. In addition to the new look, iOS 26 includes an updated Phone app and enhanced spam filtering tools. However, the highly anticipated major upgrades to the Siri voice assistant are not included in this release and are not expected until 2026.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he has no intention of harming Elon Musk's companies by revoking their government subsidies, despite their recent public disagreements. In a post on Truth Social, Trump emphasized his desire for all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to thrive. This statement follows a period of tension where Trump had previously threatened to cut government contracts with Musk's companies like SpaceX and xAI. Musk's businesses, particularly Tesla and SpaceX, receive significant financial benefits from federal contracts and regulatory credits, making their relationship with the government critically important for their financial performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite high preseason expectations, are approaching the MLB trade deadline with notable roster flaws that need addressing. While their offense leads the league in scoring, recent struggles and underperformance from key players have created uncertainty. The bullpen has been a clear weakness, and the front office is widely expected to acquire a high-leverage relief pitcher. However, the team remains publicly confident in its current lineup and starting rotation, suggesting they may bet on their established, high-priced talent to improve rather than making multiple aggressive trades before the deadline.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis highlights the significant challenge of eliminating substantial credit card debt, showing that a $40,000 balance could take over 40 years to pay off with minimum payments alone due to high interest rates. The article explores various repayment scenarios, demonstrating how more aggressive monthly payments can drastically reduce the payoff time and total interest paid. It also outlines several debt relief strategies for those with large balances, including debt settlement, consolidation loans, and balance transfers, emphasizing the importance of a structured plan to escape long-term debt.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has walked back its plan to cease issuing paper checks and transition all beneficiaries to electronic payments. The agency confirmed it will continue providing paper checks for those who have no other way to receive their benefits, though it will still encourage the adoption of electronic transfers. This reversal followed a meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, where concerns were raised about the 600,000 Americans, many of whom are unbanked, who rely on physical checks. The SSA also committed to improving customer service amid concerns about workforce reductions.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he is submitting a new anti-corruption bill to Parliament designed to protect the independence of anti-graft institutions. This move comes after a previous version of the bill, which gave the government more control over watchdog agencies, sparked large-scale domestic protests and drew sharp criticism from the European Union. Opponents of the initial legislation feared it was a step back for Ukraine's rule of law. The new bill aims to address these concerns and reaffirm Ukraine's commitment to reforms that are crucial for its EU accession ambitions.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" premiered with an episode that sharply satirized both Donald Trump and its parent company, Paramount. The episode was released just one day after creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker secured a new $1.5 billion licensing deal with the media giant. The premiere depicted a fictional Trump in various controversial scenarios and directly referenced Paramount's recent legal settlement with the president and the subsequent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." The episode's pointed critique of its new business partner has been noted by media observers as a particularly defiant creative move.</p>
