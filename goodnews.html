          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has lifted export controls on chip-design software for China, a move communicated to major firms like Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence. These companies, which dominate the electronic design automation market, are now resuming sales and support to Chinese customers. This reversal follows a tightening of restrictions in May and is seen as a sign of a potential trade truce between the two nations, occurring after China signaled progress in resuming some technology exchanges. The news prompted a roughly 5% increase in the stock prices for both Synopsys and Cadence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Cessna skydiving plane carrying 15 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey. All individuals on board survived the incident, though 14 were hospitalized, with three in critical condition.

Emergency officials noted that a recent mass casualty training exercise at the same airport contributed to the effective response. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, noting the same aircraft was involved in a 2023 landing incident in Virginia.</p>

The proposal includes a resort with restaurants and shops, parking for over 7,000 cars, and significant transport infrastructure upgrades, including a new railway station.

This early access gives CoreWeave, a smaller cloud provider in which Nvidia holds a stake, a competitive edge over giants like Amazon and Microsoft.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a 10-year plan to reform the NHS in England, focusing on shifting care from hospitals to local community hubs and increasing preventative measures. The blueprint includes establishing up to 300 neighborhood health centers, launching an "ambitious moonshot" to combat obesity with digital incentives, and expanding access to dental and mental health services. It also aims to enhance the use of technology, such as the NHS app, to create a more integrated and accessible healthcare system.

          <p>The Isle of Wight rock band Wet Leg is releasing their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," marking a significant evolution in their sound and image since their Grammy-winning debut. In an interview, frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discusses moving past the bohemian style of their early days, embracing a more authentic self-expression. She describes the new album as more sonically expressive and raw, heavily influenced by her experience of falling in love. The album, which the band says was made to be played live, retains their signature tongue-in-cheek humor while exploring more emotionally vulnerable themes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and slightly improving on May's figures. The unemployment rate also ticked down to 4.1%. Job gains were concentrated in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. This strength comes despite ongoing economic uncertainty from the Trump administration's trade policies and tariffs. The White House has downplayed the economic impact of the tariffs, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has cited them as a key reason for not lowering interest rates.
