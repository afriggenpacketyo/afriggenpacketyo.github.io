          <h2>Strategies for Efficiently Paying off a HELOC</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 15:47:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As home equity levels rise, homeowners are increasingly using HELOCs as a financing source, which offers lower interest rates than other borrowing options. A key component to HELOC success is having a solid payoff strategy, as the home serves as collateral. The article highlights strategies for HELOC borrowers, including taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, monitoring the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and strategically using the HELOC for home repairs and renovations to potentially gain tax deductions. Homeowners should speak with a lending expert to develop a personalized repayment strategy, as the best approach will depend on individual budgets and long-term financial goals.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from environmental activists. While many religious figures lauded Mr. Zeldin's public display of faith, environmentalists argued that his actions contradict the Jewish value of tikkun olam, the obligation to repair the world, given his efforts to weaken environmental regulations. Mr. Zeldin defended his policies as being based on law and science, while critics argue that his decisions prioritize corporate interests over environmental protection. The event has ignited a broader discussion about the intersection of faith, environmental stewardship, and political responsibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the shingles vaccine may have unexpected benefits for heart health, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease for up to eight years. The study, analyzing data from over 1.2 million people aged 50 or older in South Korea, found a 23% lower risk of heart issues, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary artery disease, among those vaccinated. The benefits were more significant for younger individuals and those with unhealthy behaviors. Researchers propose that preventing shingles may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation that can lead to heart disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess the effectiveness of different types of shingles vaccines across diverse populations.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt case. Fortnite was removed from iPhones in 2020 after Epic Games circumvented Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website. The recent ruling prohibits Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, potentially paving the way for Fortnite's return. However, Apple, which is appealing the ruling, still has the option to reject Fortnite's submission. This development is part of a larger legal battle between Epic Games and Apple over app store policies and commissions.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an accessible alternative to Pap smears. The test, developed by Teal Health, involves vaginal swabbing and is designed to detect HPV, which causes almost all cervical cancer cases. Patients can order the test online, consult with a telehealth provider, collect the sample, and mail it for testing. A positive test result will require a follow-up appointment for a Pap smear or colposcopy. Experts believe this at-home option could increase screening rates and help eradicate cervical cancer, but it should not be seen as a complete replacement for regular gynecological exams.</p>

FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated that this decision will provide more nations with the opportunity to develop their women's football structures.

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ms. Ozturk was detained after authorities pointed to an essay critical of Israel that she helped write in a Tufts student newspaper. The judge found no evidence that Ms. Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests, emphasizing the importance of protecting First Amendment rights. Ms. Ozturk testified about experiencing escalating asthma attacks in detention and the difficulty of continuing her academic work.

          <p>Justice David H. Souter, who recently passed away, is remembered for his careful, candid, and curious approach to his work on the Supreme Court. He approached his work with care, candor and curiosity, one case at a time. Souter, a justice from another era, was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, who expected ideological purity rather than the independence that comes with life tenure and an open-minded approach to judging. His measured prose and lack of pretension were hallmarks of his career, and he often disappointed his Republican patrons by forging his own path. His former law clerks remember him as a mentor who valued intellectual honesty and respected diverse viewpoints.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi can remain free from immigration custody while he challenges his detention in court. The court denied the Trump administration's request to re-detain Mahdawi, citing concerns about individual liberty and the government's weak legal arguments. Mahdawi, who is graduating from Columbia, was detained by immigration agents during his citizenship interview, allegedly for his pro-Palestinian activism. He has been critical of Columbia University's policies and plans to continue protesting.</p>
