          <p>Pickleball is experiencing a rapid surge in popularity across China, with online equipment sales increasing six-fold this year to an average of $1.2 million monthly. This growth is attributed to social media influence and a broader shift towards active lifestyles, partly spurred by Chinese tennis player Zheng Qinwen's Olympic success. The article highlights distinct business opportunities, as entrepreneurs build for-profit courts in dense urban areas, unlike the U.S. model. The sport's development is also uniquely systemized under the national Chinese Tennis Association. Despite potential challenges for foreign brands navigating the Chinese market, this trend signifies a robust and accelerating growth momentum for racquet sports, contributing to an anticipated pickup in overall consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Utah faces a severe shortage of affordable starter homes, with median prices exceeding half a million dollars, pushing homeownership out of reach for many young families. Governor Spencer Cox initiated a goal to construct 35,000 lower-cost homes within five years, yet only about 5,100 have been built or started. While state lawmakers have provided incentives like low-interest construction loans, housing experts contend that more fundamental changes, particularly to restrictive zoning laws, are essential for significant progress. This article showcases a developer in Plain City who successfully built starter homes under $400,000 by leveraging state assistance and smaller plots. This effort demonstrates a commitment to addressing the societal challenge of upward mobility through accessible housing.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced his retirement from Congress in 2026, emphasizing the "necessity for generational change in the party." His decision was partly influenced by observing former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election. Nadler, aged 78, was first elected in 1992 and served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2023, where he was a manager for former President Trump's first impeachment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries lauded Nadler as a "relentless fighter for justice, civil rights and liberties." This article marks a notable transition in the Democratic Party, as a veteran leader steps aside for new voices.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have engineered a compact, detergent-free washing machine for astronauts, tackling the critical challenge of laundry in space. This innovative, cube-shaped device, weighing 12kg, uses only 400ml of water per cycle, delivered as an ultra-fine mist through ultrasonic atomization. Crucially, it replaces traditional detergents with ultraviolet light to generate ozone, a powerful disinfectant capable of sterilizing clothes for up to five wears. This technological advancement offers a sustainable and resource-efficient solution for maintaining personal hygiene during extended space missions, significantly reducing the logistical burden and environmental footprint associated with astronaut clothing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's efforts to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, just as planes were ready for departure. The judge cited legal protections under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which mandates that migrant children not from Mexico must have access to an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before deportation. Attorneys argued that the government's "repatriation" plan circumvented these rights, potentially exposing children to abuse or persecution. This article highlights a significant legal intervention against the administration's broader crackdown on illegal immigration, emphasizing the ongoing debate over the treatment and legal rights of migrant minors in U.S. custody.</p>
