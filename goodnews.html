          <p>Frank Bisignano, the newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), revealed during a town hall with agency staff that he had to Google the job to understand it after being offered the position. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, acknowledged his lack of prior experience with the SSA and government work. He assured employees that Social Security was "not going away" and that President Trump supported the agency. Bisignano also emphasized the need for the SSA to adopt a "digital-first" approach, comparing the agency's services to the user experience offered by tech giants like Amazon, which will involve the aid of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

          <p>Forecasters are predicting another above-average hurricane season for the Atlantic, with 13 to 19 storms expected to form between June 1 and November 30. The National Hurricane Center warns that 6 of these storms are expected to become full-blown hurricanes, with 3 to 5 reaching major hurricane status. Climate change is contributing to the increased frequency and intensity of storms, with abnormally high sea surface temperatures playing a significant role. Weather officials are urging residents in at-risk areas to review evacuation plans, understand local flood risks, and secure flood insurance. Of note, FEMA was not present at the annual hurricane forecast announcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The new review identified only about 20 books that need to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms related to DEI, race, and gender issues, bringing the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

The report paints a bleak picture of American childhood, describing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and mental illness. It targets technology companies and social media platforms for contributing to a "technology-driven lifestyle." The report reiterates talking points about vaccines, while notably omitting the claim that vaccines cause autism. It emphasizes the role of ultraprocessed foods and synthetic chemicals in declining children's health, while stopping short of calling glyphosate and atrazine unsafe.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally on Thursday, hitting a new record high above $111,000. The price of the cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $111,578.76, according to Coin Metrics. The climb for the cryptocurrency has been slower than usual, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have been key catalysts. The price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities, and Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong and steady inflows. U.S. President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto czar David Sacks have pushed forward a pro-crypto agenda in the U.S., which has helped support the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay rise after the government accepted salary recommendations from pay review bodies. Education unions have welcomed the decision, but warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding. Health unions, however, have reacted negatively, as other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives, will receive a smaller rise of 3.6%. Resident doctors will get an extra ¬£750 top-up, bringing their average rise to 5.4%. The British Medical Association (BMA) has deemed the rise "woefully inadequate" and plans to ballot them next week over possible strike action. Inflation unexpectedly rose to 3.5% in the year to April, complicating perceptions of how generous the offers are.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives advanced a multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package that could have sweeping impacts on household finances. The legislation, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could make permanent President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, while adding new provisions that could significantly overhaul student borrowing, health savings accounts, and car ownership. The bill includes a higher SALT deduction limit, a bigger child tax credit, Medicaid and SNAP cuts, a "bonus" deduction for older adults, health savings account expansions, new 'Trump Accounts' for child savings, reduced student loan benefits, a car loan interest deduction, and a tax break on tip income. The bill is likely to see changes in the Senate before Trump signs it into law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump's Executive Order Dismantling Education Department</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle the Department of Education. Judge Myong Joun blocked the administration from carrying out its reduction-in-force, or RIF, at the Education Department, which was announced on March 11. Joun also blocked transferring the management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Education Department. All fired federal employees from the department must be reinstated as well. The judge stated that the RIF would likely cripple the Department and that there was no evidence that the RIF had made the Department more efficient. The ruling is seen as a step to reverse the war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity.</p>
