          <p>The leaders of China, Russia, and India convened at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, presenting a united front among major non-Western powers. The article captures a moment of apparent camaraderie between Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Narendra Modi, who were seen smiling and holding hands. This public display of friendship occurs against a backdrop of complex geopolitical dynamics, including ongoing wars and trade tensions with the West. The brief interaction, translated by an interpreter, began with Putin referring to the trio as 'three friends,' highlighting the deepening ties being forged within this regional security bloc.</p>

          <p>Employees at Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon national parks have overwhelmingly voted to unionize, with over 97% of ballots cast in favor. The move comes after the National Park Service experienced significant staff reductions and budget cuts under the current administration, leading to rock-bottom morale and fears of job insecurity. Workers cite long-standing issues such as low pay and poor living conditions, which have been exacerbated by recent turmoil. The unionization aims to provide employees, including rangers, biologists, and firefighters, with greater job protections and a stronger voice in advocating for better working conditions.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a mother reflects on the profound sense of loss and disorientation after her youngest child leaves for college, marking the end of 27 years of active parenting. The once-chaotic family home is now strangely silent and orderly, and the daily structure imposed by children's schedules has vanished. This new phase of life requires a significant adjustment, as the author grapples with being the 'sole proprietor' of her day for the first time in decades. She shares a list of personal resolutions to navigate this transition, from eating proper meals to rediscovering hobbies and being patient with the grieving process.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new David Geffen Galleries building, set to open in 2026, is seeing its first art installation, a commissioned photo sculpture by artist Todd Gray. The process involves drilling directly into the new concrete walls, a feature that allows for unique mounting possibilities. This installation is part of a broader shift in the museum's curatorial approach, which will move away from chronological and regional displays toward interwoven exhibits that create dialogue between different works. The building's design, featuring large windows and specially glazed colored walls, aims to create a new context for viewing art.</p>

          <p>A former parking structure for the now-closed Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been redeveloped into a 201-unit luxury apartment complex. The project reflects a growing trend of repurposing defunct shopping centers to address housing shortages and changing consumer habits. The new complex, named Overland & Ayres, features high-end amenities like a resort-style pool, a pet spa, and personal training services, with rents starting at $3,800 per month. This transformation is part of a larger overhaul of the iconic mall, with the main building being converted by UCLA into a major biomedical research center.</p>

          <p>Norwegian energy company Equinor has committed nearly $1 billion in new capital to support Danish offshore wind developer Orsted, which has faced significant challenges and political attacks from the Trump administration. Equinor, Orsted's second-largest shareholder, framed the investment as a show of confidence in the long-term viability of the offshore wind industry. The move comes as the U.S. government continues to create obstacles for wind projects, recently canceling federal funding for related infrastructure. Equinor's backing provides a crucial lifeline for Orsted and signals continued European commitment to renewable energy despite American political uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was sought by immigrant advocacy groups who argued the children would face abuse and persecution if returned, and that the action violated federal laws protecting them. Administration officials contended the flights were for family reunification requested by the Guatemalan government, not deportations. The judge's order will remain in place for 14 days, preventing the removal of the children while the legal arguments are further examined.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's government-owned rail operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. The move is intended to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport, providing environmental benefits. For some key routes, such as Edinburgh to Glasgow, the change will reduce ticket prices by nearly 50%. The policy follows a pilot scheme and is expected to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually, which will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger numbers.</p>

This breakthrough in thermoelectric conversion could pave the way for self-charging wearable devices, such as smartwatches, eliminating the need for bulky batteries or frequent charging. The material harnesses the temperature difference between the human body (around 37°C) and the surrounding environment to generate a constant power supply. Unlike previous flexible thermoelectric materials, this new creation is also highly elastic, making it ideal for integration into wearable technology.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's recent signings of two elite strikers, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike, have prompted speculation about the team's tactical direction under new manager Arne Slot. This move is unusual in modern football, where teams typically rely on a single primary forward. The article explores several potential formations, including a narrow 4-2-3-1 where the wingers act as number 10s, or a more aggressive 4-2-4 system. Another possibility is that the club does not intend to play both strikers simultaneously, instead using them in rotation to manage a demanding schedule of over 60 games and adapt to different opponents.</p>
