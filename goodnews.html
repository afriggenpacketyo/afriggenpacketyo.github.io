          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's National Guard Deployment to Portland</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 20:37:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. This ruling supports the state's argument that sending federalized troops would likely inflame protests, rather than de-escalate them, echoing past events in 2020. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, concurred that the deployment would violate constitutional principles and federal laws restricting military involvement in domestic law enforcement, despite the Justice Department's claims of "vicious radicals" besieging an ICE office. Oregon's governor hailed the decision, stating there is no insurrection or national security threat in Portland, but rather a threat to democracy led by President Trump. This decision represents a significant legal challenge to President Trump's strategy of dispatching federal forces to cities against the will of local Democratic leaders, further highlighting the stark divide in how the situation on the ground is perceived.</p>

          <h2>The Unexpected Rise of Queuing as a Social and Experiential Activity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 20:26:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Queuing for hours, once seen as an inconvenience, is transforming into a desirable social activity, particularly for product launches and brand experiences. This article explores how individuals, like those waiting for a Korean cosmetics store opening, find excitement, camaraderie, and opportunities to make new friends in these lines. Psychologists explain that the "anticipation of reward" triggers dopamine release, creating a positive feeling, especially for exclusive or hard-to-get items. Brands are increasingly leveraging "experiential marketing" with freebies, performances, and interactive elements to create buzz and social media content, recognizing that the queue itself often becomes part of the shared, enjoyable experience for consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, previously a regional bishop for Metropolitan Chicago, succeeds the first woman to lead the ELCA, Reverend Elizabeth Eaton. His six-year term begins amid challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including membership declines and theological debates over LGBTQ+ inclusion, which the ELCA has embraced since 2009. Curry, who grew up Catholic and became a Lutheran through a unique path, aims to foster a more connected church, hoping his presence will encourage more leaders of color.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport temporarily closed its airspace in the early hours of Sunday, with Lithuanian media reporting the closure was due to the possible sighting of hot air balloons. The airport confirmed that a "possible series of balloons heading toward Vilnius Airport" prompted the decision, affecting flights which were subsequently redirected to other airports like Riga and Kaunas. This incident is the latest in a string of recent European airport closures over unauthorized aerial objects, including drone sightings, as seen in Munich, Germany. The temporary disruption underscores persistent concerns about aviation safety and the operational challenges posed by unidentified or unexpected airborne phenomena in controlled airspace, requiring immediate responses from authorities.</p>

Interim playcaller Jerry Neuheisel, elevated just four days prior, orchestrated an offensive plan that saw the Bruins score on their first five drives. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a standout performance, accounting for five touchdowns and showcasing his talent after a challenging start to the season. The unexpected win, celebrated with chants of "Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!" from the ecstatic home crowd, provided a much-needed morale boost for the team, leaving open the question of whether this marks a turning point or a temporary reprieve in their season.</p>

          <h2>Understanding "Freshers' Flu": Why University Students Frequently Fall Ill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," a common affliction among new university students, is an assortment of cold viruses that spread rapidly due to the unique environment of campus life. Immunologists explain that bringing together students from diverse backgrounds in close quarters exposes them to new viruses, while factors like late nights, poor diet, and stress from new responsibilities weaken their immune systems. Stress, in particular, releases cortisol, which suppresses immune responses, and lack of sleep further compromises defenses. While typically not serious, the intense exposure and compromised immunity make students susceptible to multiple infections, highlighting the challenge of maintaining health during the initial weeks of university.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration initiative that would have kept immigrant children in custody after their 18th birthdays, preventing their transfer to adult detention centers. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that automatically detaining these individuals violates a 2021 court order, which mandated their release to the "least restrictive setting available" if not a danger or flight risk. This ruling adds to mounting legal challenges against Trump's immigration policies, particularly those involving minors, and comes shortly after reports of a plan to offer immigrant children $2,500 to self-deport. Advocacy groups criticize these policies for pressuring children to abandon legal claims and for allegedly reviving family separation tactics.</p>

Known for her staunch conservative views, including opposition to married women retaining maiden names and same-sex marriage, Takaichi has recently softened her stance, proposing policies like tax breaks for childcare. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, she aims to revive his "Abenomics" economic vision and has called for easing constitutional restrictions on Japan's Self-Defence Forces. Her personal experiences with caregiving underpin her policy proposals for expanding women's health services and improving care options for Japan's aging society.</p>

          <p>Milan Mandaric, the Serbian-American businessman renowned for owning English football clubs including Portsmouth, Leicester City, and Sheffield Wednesday, has died at 87 after a short illness. Mandaric, who first entered English football in 1999 with Portsmouth, was known for his "Mr. Fixit" reputation, often acquiring financially distressed clubs and leading them to promotion before selling them. His career included signing George Best for a Silicon Valley team, and he was memorably involved in a corruption saga with Harry Redknapp, ultimately being acquitted of tax evasion. Mandaric's family stated his love for football was surpassed only by his love for his family, and his former clubs have expressed deep sadness at his passing, acknowledging his significant impact on their histories.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, celebrating the potential Gaza ceasefire deal and crediting President Trump for brokering the agreement. The mood at the rally, the first since Hamas accepted Trump's proposal, was more hopeful than previous protests, with many attendees expressing gratitude for Trump's intervention after what they perceived as Prime Minister Netanyahu's failure to secure hostage releases. The U.S. 20-point plan entails Hamas releasing all remaining hostages and handing over Gaza's governance to a technocratic committee, in exchange for Israel's phased withdrawal, prisoner release, and humanitarian aid. Despite Netanyahu's claims of being on the "verge of a great achievement," protesters voiced skepticism that he might still sabotage the deal, prioritizing his political survival.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for announcing the release of all hostages from Gaza "in the coming days," stating Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement." His comments follow Hamas's conditional acceptance of a U.S. peace plan, which proposes an immediate end to fighting and the release of remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli withdrawal. President Trump urged Hamas to "move quickly" on the deal, threatening that "all bets will be off" if there's delay, while also claiming Israel agreed to an initial withdrawal line. Despite cautious optimism, significant obstacles remain, including Hamas's demand for full Israeli withdrawal and disarmament, and suspicions that Netanyahu might prolong the war for political gain.</p>

          <p>Hearts fans are daring to dream of a Scottish Premiership title challenge after their unbeaten side secured a dramatic 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner, extending their lead to five points. Head coach Derek McInnes, while professionally cautious, acknowledged fans' right to excitement following the stunning start to the season. The early optimism is fueled by a £10 million investment from owner Tony Bloom, who boldly predicted a challenge for second place, a prospect now seeming more realistic given Rangers' turmoil and Celtic's slow start. Despite warnings against premature celebrations, referencing Aberdeen's past collapse, pundits agree that Hearts supporters have every right to be optimistic about their team's unexpected success.</p>

Lammens made two significant saves, showcasing agility and competence that impressed commentators and fans alike. Coach Ruben Amorim explained the delay in Lammens' debut was to allow him to adapt to the new country and the immense pressure. This positive start, along with United's third consecutive home win, offers a glimmer of hope amidst the team's otherwise challenging season under Amorim.</p>
