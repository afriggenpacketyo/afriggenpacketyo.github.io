          <p>Ether, a leading cryptocurrency, experienced a significant price surge, nearing its record high, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate adjustments in his Jackson Hole speech. Powell's comments on shifting risks possibly warranting a policy stance change led to a "panicked repositioning" among traders, resulting in $120 million in short liquidations for ETH. Companies focused on accumulating ether also saw their shares rebound, indicating renewed market momentum. This surge follows a period of risk-off moves and significant outflows from ether exchange-traded funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to secure comprehensive coverage for the league. NBC is set to acquire Sunday games and Wild Card playoff rights for an estimated $200 million annually, while Netflix will broadcast the Home Run Derby for $50 million a year. ESPN is receiving a new package worth $550 million, including rights to MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategy to diversify partnerships amidst declining traditional TV viewership and growing interest from streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, but the IRS has provided a crucial clarification for car buyers. Shoppers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract and make a payment before the deadline, even if vehicle delivery occurs later. This flexibility aims to assist those purchasing vehicles requiring shipment or custom orders, a significant change from previous delivery-date-based eligibility. The expiring credit is part of a broader shift in EV policy, with analysts expecting a short-term sales bump followed by a decline, impacting automakers and environmental goals.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock saw a significant rise following reports that the Trump administration is poised to acquire an equity stake in the chipmaker. President Trump stated the government should receive about 10% of the company, a move supported by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as a return for CHIPS Act funds. This action signals a notable shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking an active role in corporate America. Despite Intel slowing construction on its Ohio factory, the $2 billion SoftBank investment and government backing aim to bolster the company's efforts in advanced chip manufacturing.

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland father, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee, marking a significant development after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. A court order facilitated his release, allowing him to return to his family in Maryland. Ábrego García was initially deported under claims of MS-13 gang affiliation, which he denies, and reported being tortured during his detention in El Salvador. Despite facing human smuggling charges upon his return to the U.S., a federal judge has blocked further deportation efforts, ensuring he remains under ICE supervision in Maryland.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his Jackson Hole speech, cautiously indicated that conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, citing shifting risks and "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he noted rising downside dangers and inflation risks from tariffs. Powell emphasized the Fed's commitment to proceeding carefully and maintaining independence from political demands for lower rates. His remarks, though tepid, caused stocks to soar and Treasury yields to fall, as markets interpreted them as a signal for potential easing by the Federal Open Market Committee.

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquencies climb, many Americans are seeking relief, with credit card forbearance emerging as a temporary option. This article explains that forbearance allows borrowers to pause or reduce payments for a limited period, potentially including fee waivers or interest relief, though interest may still accrue. Qualification typically requires proof of financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, and a history of on-time payments. For those ineligible, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy are available to help regain control of debt.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, but will maintain levies on autos, steel, and aluminum. This decision follows a phone call with President Trump and aims to re-establish free trade for most goods covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Carney stated the move, effective September 1, matches U.S. tariff rates on compliant goods, preserving Canada's trade advantage. The White House welcomed the action as "long overdue," as both nations continue negotiations on outstanding trade issues, particularly in vulnerable sectors.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reached an out-of-court settlement to pay compensation to thousands of Kenyans affected by a fire caused by a British military training exercise in 2021. The fire in the Lolldaiga conservancy led to claims of property loss and health complications from 7,723 individuals. While the British High Commission called the fire "extremely regrettable," the lawyer for the claimants, Kevin Kubai, described the £2.9 million settlement as the "best possible outcome" despite client complaints about the sums.
