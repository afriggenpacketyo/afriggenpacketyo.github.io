          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng met in Geneva for trade talks, marking the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing. Both sides described the talks as productive and constructive, signaling substantial progress in de-escalating the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets and raised fears of a global recession. Following the meetings, US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said the deal struck with China would help reduce the US's $1.2tn trade deficit. The World Trade Organization inspector general called the talks a significant step forward, urging both nations to continue developing solutions to mitigate tensions and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar regarding the potential transfer of a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One, with Qatar possibly offering a version of a Boeing 747-8. While Qatar denies that the plane would be a gift, they acknowledge discussions about the transfer of an aircraft for "temporary use" between the two countries. The plane would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials before use. President Trump defended the negotiations, referring to the plane as a gift offered for his use at no cost, and said it would replace the 40-year-old Air Force One temporarily. Critics are sure to raise legal and ethical questions among critics. The current Air Force One planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based food company, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items from businesses across California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington after federal regulators found a strain of listeria on its equipment. The recalled items, sold under the Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go, and Fresh Take Crave Away brands, include sandwiches and protein snacks with ‚ÄúUse by‚Äù dates from April 22 through May 19. The recall was prompted by a routine inspection where investigators linked the listeria strain to an outbreak first identified last year that sickened at least 10 people. Although no illnesses have been linked to the recalled food, the company pulled the items as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower drug costs, a proposal he tried unsuccessfully to implement during his first term. The order would likely impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, such as infusions for cancer, and faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will hurt innovation. The Biden administration previously abandoned a similar proposal, citing court orders and stakeholder concerns.</p>

The proposal is what he calls a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù pricing model.

The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks. Companies have warned that such a policy would lead them to spend less on research, depriving patients of new medicines.</p>

Patients like Ellen Davis, who have experienced significant health improvements on Zepbound, are being forced to switch to a less effective medication. Experts argue both drugs should remain available due to varying patient responses, but PBMs often prioritize cost savings over individual patient needs.</p>

          <p>The market for high-protein versions of snacks and food staples is growing, with celebrities like Khloe Kardashian and Zac Efron promoting such products. While sales are rising, experts question whether these products are genuinely useful for building muscle or living a healthy life, or if they are merely a marketing gimmick. Personal trainer Ethan Smith emphasizes whole foods over processed protein snacks, while Dr. Paul Morgan warns that many supermarket products advertising protein content are ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù and may be ultra-processed. Excess protein is stored as fat, and some protein-advertised snacks can have as many calories as regular products.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial of two weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Wegovy, has shown that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial, which was paid for by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro, involved 750 obese people. Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeding the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. The trial also showed that those on Mounjaro had better blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.</p>
