          <p>Jannik Sinner defeated Novak Djokovic to advance to the French Open final, where he will face Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz reached the final after his opponent, Lorenzo Musetti, retired due to injury during their semi-final match. Musetti, who had been playing well, suffered a thigh problem that prevented him from continuing the match. The final between Sinner and Alcaraz promises to be a highly anticipated contest between two of the sport's top players.</p>

          <p>Dilly Dally, a loggerhead sea turtle, was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after recovering at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center (LMC) in Florida following a predator attack that necessitated the amputation of her right front flipper. Despite wound complications during her five-month stay, Dilly Dally has successfully rejoined other rehabilitated turtles in the wild. The LMC will track Dilly Dally's movements via satellite to monitor her re-acclimation to her natural habitat. Organizations like the LMC prioritize helping heal and protect sea turtles, which face threats from poaching, accidental catching, and habitat degradation.</p>

The SNP had previously held the seat since 2011, but the by-election result signals a potential shift in the political landscape. Reform UK finished third, surpassing the Conservatives, while the Scottish Labour leader hailed the win as proof that his party had "proven the pollsters wrong."</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in West Texas, which began in January, is showing signs of decline, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. No new cases have been reported in the latest update, with the total case count remaining at 742. The majority of cases have been concentrated in Gaines County, home to a Mennonite community with historically low immunization rates, and two unvaccinated children have died due to the disease. While the outbreak appears to be subsiding, health officials warn that it only takes one person in an under-vaccinated community to trigger another outbreak.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to enhance the detection and identification of drones and to counter unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling. This initiative is particularly prioritized due to upcoming large-scale events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to boost U.S. development of drones and commercial use of the technology for deliveries and other purposes.</p>
