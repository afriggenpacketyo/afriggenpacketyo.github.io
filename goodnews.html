          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from a stronger euro, the bank expressed confidence in meeting its full-year targets. The positive earnings report, driven by factors like increased volatility in foreign exchange, caused the bank's shares to rise by over 5% to near ten-year highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's move from Manchester United to Barcelona is being viewed with great interest in Spain, as fans and journalists assess how the English forward will fit into the team. While Barcelona's first choices for a new winger were reportedly other players, Rashford's versatility and lower cost made him an attractive option for a club still managing financial constraints. Commentators believe the transfer offers a significant opportunity for Rashford to revitalize his career after a period of poor form. His success will depend on whether he can recapture the world-class potential he displayed earlier in his career.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK to sign a major free trade agreement with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aimed at boosting economic ties between the two nations. The deal will see India lower tariffs on British goods like cars and spirits, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones. After nearly three years of negotiations, the pact is projected to increase bilateral trade by an additional £25.5 billion annually by 2040. The agreement represents a significant diplomatic and economic achievement, expected to create jobs and drive growth in both countries.</p>

          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu is being featured in an exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where his work engages directly with the Dutch master's legacy. Titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path," the show presents ten paintings by Madu that infuse Vincent van Gogh's famous motifs with a modern, West African perspective. Madu, a self-taught artist like Van Gogh, draws inspiration from his upbringing in Lagos and identifies as a "global citizen" influenced by diverse sources like Japanese manga. He views the collaboration as a tribute to an artist he has admired since childhood.</p>

          <p>A semi-professional cyclist from Angus, Scotland, has achieved the monumental feat of mountain biking down all 282 of the country's Munros. Sean Green, 36, is believed to be only the second person ever to complete the challenge, which involves climbing to the summit of every Scottish mountain over 3,000 feet with a bike and then riding down. The quest took him approximately eight and a half years to finish, combining his passions for mountain biking and the outdoors. Green described the logistics and time away from his family as the most difficult aspects of his epic adventure.</p>

          <p>In a move to address its aging population and stimulate the economy, China plans to provide monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens. The electronic vouchers, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, are intended to help cover costs for elderly care services such as meal assistance, rehabilitation, and day care. This policy marks a rare use of direct fiscal support by Beijing, which has typically avoided cash handouts. The program, which will be piloted before a nationwide rollout, targets disabled seniors and aims to ease the financial burden on families while fostering growth in the services sector.

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed. The ruling overturns one of the most high-profile outcomes of the financial crisis and raises questions about potential compensation and the possibility of appeals from other convicted traders. The decision is also fueling calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the broader scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods. Hayes and Palombo maintained they were made scapegoats for the anti-bank backlash following the 2008 crash.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower-court ruling that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a nationwide injunction, preventing the administration from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The court's majority agreed that the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause was incorrect. This decision marks the first time an appeals court has ruled on the matter, moving the contentious issue closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, a growing number of states are passing laws to override local zoning regulations that restrict the construction of denser, more affordable housing. In Utah, where the median home price has soared to over $500,000, the state has strengthened mandates requiring cities to create affordable options, though it faces pushback from municipalities concerned about losing local control. This state-level intervention reflects a broader trend to combat the housing shortage and prevent a generation of young people from being priced out of homeownership, which has historically been a key driver of middle-class wealth.</p>

A team of 25 researchers from both nations set sail from Vladivostok for a 45-day mission in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The expedition will focus on the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments and sediment processes over the last 126,000 years. The resumption of these joint missions signals a renewed commitment to bilateral scientific cooperation, particularly as both countries have growing ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>
