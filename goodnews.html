          <p>During the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, First Lady Melania Trump sent a hand-delivered letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to prioritize the protection of children worldwide. The letter, shared by the U.S. President on social media, appeals to a shared sense of humanity, stating that all children are born innocent and dream of safety and love, regardless of nationality or politics. The first lady's message frames the protection of future generations as a transcendent goal that would serve not just Russia but all of humanity, positioning it as a bold vision for peace.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, is now broadening his appeal to non-Democratic voters as he launches his general election campaign. In a recent speech, Mamdani focused on affordability and the government's role in meeting citizens' "material needs," sharing anecdotes about registered Republicans and others who were unable to vote for him in the primary but could in November. He is positioning his campaign as a growing movement capable of reaching more New Yorkers and demonstrating that local government can effectively address their concerns.</p>

Seeking a different cultural perspective for their children and a lifestyle more connected to nature, they relocated to San Sebastián in the Basque Region. Despite challenges like integrating into an insular culture and navigating bureaucracy, the family has embraced the outdoors, a slower pace of life, and a worldview that they feel would have been impossible to gain by staying in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. Despite weakening, it remains a major hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph, and forecasters expect its intensity to fluctuate over the next few days. The storm is currently north of the Caribbean, and while not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is generating dangerous swells and rip currents affecting islands like Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos, where a tropical storm warning is in effect.</p>
