          <p>Rahaman Ali, a former heavyweight boxer and the younger brother of Muhammad Ali, has passed away at the age of 82. Born Rudolph Arnett Clay, he followed his famous brother into boxing and was a constant source of support throughout Muhammad's career, often traveling and training with him. After retiring from the ring, Rahaman authored two books about his life and his relationship with his iconic brother. The Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, announced his death, remembering him as his brother's biggest supporter and an integral part of the boxing legend's story. Funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.</p>

Hughes clocked a wind-assisted 9.94 seconds, while rising star Hunt dominated the women's race with a personal best of 11.02 seconds, especially after defending champion Daryll Neita was disqualified for a false start. The event also saw world indoor pole vault champion Molly Caudery win her event and discus thrower Lawrence Okoye confirm his selection for the national team.

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters, Matt Hayball and James Burnip, are battling for a single NFL contract worth nearly $3 million. This follows a trend for the Saints, who have consistently pitted punters against each other in recent years. Hayball, the incumbent, and Burnip, a rookie from the University of Alabama, are both graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. Despite the cutthroat nature of the NFL's roster cuts, where only one will remain employed, the two maintain a friendly camaraderie, focusing on personal improvement while competing for the coveted spot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first start since a shoulder injury sidelined him early in the season, Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a sharp performance, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who capitalized on the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. Despite the 4-0 loss, Snell's outing was seen as highly promising, as he showed excellent command and velocity, reassuring the team of his potential impact for the postseason. The Dodgers are hopeful he can provide a significant boost to their rotation down the stretch.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear frontrunner among the remaining candidates. For months, potential contenders had their campaigns stalled by the possibility of her entry. Now, candidates like former Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are vying to establish momentum in what experts call a "wide open" field. With no candidate possessing statewide name recognition comparable to Harris, factors like fundraising, key endorsements, and the ability to build a public profile will be crucial in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Gad has announced he will perform as King Herod in the Hollywood Bowl's production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" on Sunday, after a bout with COVID-19 nearly forced him to miss the entire run. Gad initially pulled out of the show, and John Stamos was announced as his replacement for the weekend. However, after testing negative, Gad confirmed his return for the final performance via social media. The highly anticipated show, also starring Cynthia Erivo and Adam Lambert, has generated significant excitement, and Gad's last-minute return adds another dramatic twist to the celebrated production.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a niche experiment into a foundational pillar of the modern financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Originally conceived as a "world computer" for programmable money, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and the tokenization of real-world assets by major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on its staggering growth from a small community to a global platform, while emphasizing the need to maintain decentralization as mainstream adoption accelerates. Experts note Ethereum is becoming the essential, invisible plumbing for global finance.</p>

          <p>England is chasing a formidable target of 374 runs to win the fifth Test and the series against India, ending day three at 50-1. The hosts' task was made more difficult by the late dismissal of opener Zak Crawley just before the close of play. Earlier, India built a strong second-innings total of 396, powered by a sublime century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite a five-wicket haul from Josh Tongue, England's efforts were hampered by six dropped catches, setting up a tense and decisive final two days of the series.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly adults under 30, are now regularly getting their news from TikTok, relying on content creators and news-adjacent memes rather than traditional media outlets. This article examines the trend through creators like Aaron Parnas, who provides rapid-fire updates on current events to millions of followers. While critics raise concerns about misinformation and the platform's Chinese ownership, users value the convenience and simplified terms. The platform's algorithm-driven, entertainment-focused format is reshaping how news is produced and consumed, forcing established outlets to adapt with skits and other non-traditional formats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border, affirming that the government cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being returned to countries where they face persecution or torture. The ruling stems from a proclamation President Trump issued to close the asylum system, which has been used to summarily expel migrants. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying discretionary asylum, it upheld protections under the Convention Against Torture, which are mandatory. The decision marks a significant legal check on the administration's hardline immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The court agreed that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like their race, speaking Spanish, or their location, as such practices likely violate the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests in Southern California. This ruling reinforces legal guardrails against what advocates have described as discriminatory and indiscriminate enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>England secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain in a World Cup warm-up match, but the win was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer. Packer was sent off for a clumsy but dangerous clearout, which could result in a suspension ahead of the World Cup. Head coach John Mitchell praised Packer's performance before the incident but acknowledged the team must accept the consequences. The match provided a platform for other players to impress, but the potential absence of the experienced captain adds a layer of uncertainty to England's preparations.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have exposed a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones and jamming systems at inflated prices. According to investigators, a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel were caught accepting kickbacks of up to 30% from state contracts with suppliers. The announcement came just two days after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored by parliament, following major public protests against a government move to curb their powers. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy affirmed his commitment to a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and praised the agencies' work.</p>
