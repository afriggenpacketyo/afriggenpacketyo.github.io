        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to advance to the quarter-finals of the French Open, continuing his pursuit of a record 25th Grand Slam singles title. Djokovic beat Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, ending the Briton's run at Roland Garros, where he was playing in the last 16 for the first time. Despite some moments where Djokovic appeared flat, he maintained control of the match, preventing Norrie from mounting a serious challenge. Djokovic is set to face Alexander Zverev in the next round, seeking to avenge his loss to the German in the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.</p>

          <h2>CBS News Explains Why You Should Open a $10,000 Long-Term CD This June</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News suggests that opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June 2025 could be a wise financial decision for many savers. With potential rate cuts looming from the Federal Reserve later in the summer, securing a CD now can lock in current rates, which are still in the 4% range. A long-term CD also provides protection against market volatility, offering a fixed interest rate regardless of market changes. Depending on the CD term, savers can earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, making it a simple and safe way to grow their money (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jack Draper's run at the French Open ended with a defeat to Alexander Bublik in the last 16, with Bublik producing a strong performance to win in four sets. Draper, who was expected to progress further in the tournament, lost 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to the Kazakh player. Bublik's effective use of drop shots and overall shot-making proved challenging for Draper, who acknowledged the defeat as a tough loss.

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano located in Sicily, erupted, releasing a large ash cloud and lava fountain. The Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology reported increasing explosions from the volcano's southeast crater, causing a lava flow. While the summit area was blocked off to tour groups as a precaution, authorities stated that there was no risk to the local population or air travel. Etna is known for its frequent eruptions, and this event follows a significant eruption just over a year ago, with the current activity caused by the collapse of part of the southeast crater. Despite the dramatic display, regional government officials assured that the pyroclastic flows posed no danger to the island's inhabitants.</p>

Recent trade deal developments, particularly with the UK and countries in the Middle East, have boosted Boeing's stock, which had previously been impacted by the 737 Max 9 incident.

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has identified Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri as his top target to address the team's need for a specialist left-back. Since Benjamin Mendy's departure, City has used various players in the position, including Oleksandr Zinchenko, Joao Cancelo, and Josko Gvardiol. While youngster Nico O'Reilly filled the role towards the end of last season, Guardiola is keen to find a permanent solution. Although no agreement is yet in place, sources are optimistic that the transfer of the 23-year-old Algeria international will be completed, providing City with a much-needed specialist in the left-back position.</p>

          <p>Britain's defence review emphasizes the need for a significant transformation of the armed forces to prepare for potential war, but acknowledges that achieving these goals will require increased funding. While the review welcomes the government's ambition to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034, it suggests that accelerating this timeline may be necessary given the turbulent global landscape. The review identifies Russia as an immediate threat, China as a persistent challenge, and Iran and North Korea as regional disruptors, warning of alarming new threats and vulnerabilities. The report's author's describe the review as the "most profound" change in UK defence in 150 years.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles has resurfaced, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth advocating for gender-neutral fitness standards across all combat jobs. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, shared her experiences, emphasizing that the standards were never lowered for her. Vanasse highlighted that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. Hegseth's stance has drawn criticism from those who argue that it discounts the accomplishments of women in the military and overlooks the diverse skill set required for combat effectiveness.</p>
