          <p>President Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with generals and admirals convened by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in Quantico. While the White House has not commented, Trump expressed his approval of the gathering, stating, "I love it." The meeting is considered highly unusual due to its large scale and the short notice given to senior military leaders summoned from around the world. This has led to observations that such a gathering is rare, if not entirely unprecedented, within the military's operational norms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a public referendum, over 61% of voters in Zurich, Switzerland, approved a measure to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums, citing concerns over noise and air pollution. The new rules will completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to a three-month period from October to December. Supporters argued the devices are harmful to microorganisms and spread fine dust, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents criticized the vote as an expression of an overly restrictive "culture of prohibition" that would unnecessarily complicate grounds maintenance.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring upcoming U.S. jobs data, including the September nonfarm payrolls report, to gauge the health of the labor market. These figures will be critical in shaping expectations for the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy for the remainder of the year. Alongside employment statistics, the performance of the Treasury market, particularly the yields on longer-term bonds, will also be a key indicator of economic sentiment. The market is currently anticipating potential rate cuts, but this week's data could significantly shift that outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are reflecting on their long and unconventional path to fame. Despite early success with their hit "She's Not There," the band struggled financially and broke up before their album "Odessey and Oracle" gained recognition. A full year after its release, the track "Time of the Season" became a major hit, solidifying the album's classic status decades later. The surviving members, now in their 80s, were eventually inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, capping a strange but ultimately successful career.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a new industrial model, termed a "space pull system," designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach shifts from the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, to a "pull" model where final assembly dictates the production of parts only when needed. The goal is to create a more flexible, cost-effective, and consistent production line to meet the exponentially growing global demand for space systems. This innovation aims to position China as a dominant force in the future of space exploration and commerce.</p>

          <p>A communications expert and former world champion debater advises professionals to avoid using certain phrases that can undermine their credibility and minimize the importance of their work. Phrases such as "It'll just take a second" set unrealistic expectations, while "No worries if not" can signal that a request is a low priority. Additionally, prefacing a statement with "I'm not an expert, but..." immediately reduces one's authority. The expert suggests using more direct and confident language to better articulate requests and demonstrate respect for both oneself and colleagues.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores continue to fail, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for local and small businesses to secure prime real estate. With demand softening, landlords are becoming more open to negotiating flexible lease terms and lower rents with independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses that were previously priced out. While rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, allowing for a market recalibration. This trend is enabling small businesses to move into spaces with established foot traffic, providing a canvas for unique, community-focused enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative, framing it as a core part of the party's economic growth strategy and drawing parallels to the post-war Labour government's housing boom. The plan aims to build entire communities, not just houses.</p>
