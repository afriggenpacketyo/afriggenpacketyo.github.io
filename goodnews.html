The conservative CDU/CSU alliance and center-left SPD are hoping for a strong showing. Observers are also closely monitoring the performance of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has been classified as "right-wing extremist" and aims to expand its influence in western Germany after recent national gains.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans football team secured a significant 33-17 victory over Purdue, marking their first win outside the West since 2012 and ending a 14-game losing streak in Eastern and Central time zones. Despite a three-hour lightning delay and previous struggles with fourth-quarter leads on the road, USC maintained composure. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the offense with 282 passing yards and a rushing touchdown, while safety Bishop Fitzgerald sealed the win with a crucial interception in the fourth quarter. This win signals a potential turning point for the team's performance in Big Ten conference road games.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, which aims to phase out PFAS, or "forever chemicals," from various household items including cookware, cleaning products, and food packaging. This move, supported by environmentalists like Mark Ruffalo, has faced opposition from celebrity chefs and the cookware industry, who argue that certain PFAS types like PTFE (Teflon) are safe when used correctly. The legislation cites significant threats to public health and the environment, with exposure to PFAS linked to serious health effects. If signed by Governor Newsom, the ban will be implemented with compliance deadlines extending to 2031.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has developed a new generation of foundation models, exemplified by Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, which offers strong performance despite being significantly smaller and more cost-efficient than previous iterations. This technical innovation has allowed the model to perform ten times faster in some tasks while reducing training costs by 90%. Industry experts, like Emad Mostaque of Stability AI, have praised its efficiency, noting its estimated training cost of under $500,000 compared to much larger investments for competing models. This advancement positions Alibaba as a leading player in China's artificial intelligence boom.</p>

          <h2>Parents Grapple with Emotionally Based School Avoidance Amid Rising Absences</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 20:21:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Parents and educators are increasingly facing challenges with emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA), a condition where children find attending school traumatic, contributing to a post-pandemic surge in persistent absences. One mother, Julie, shared her regret over pushing her autistic daughter, Rosie, into school despite severe distress and self-harm. Schools are responding by prioritizing inclusion, with some opening specialist units and offering mental health support. Experts emphasize early intervention and a shift from viewing absences as defiance to understanding underlying anxieties, as the issue impacts children's academic and social development.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a pilot program to fast-track the use of electric air taxis, known as eVTOL aircraft, aiming to solidify US leadership in airspace technology. The Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop new regulations and foster partnerships with private companies and local governments. This three-year program will involve at least five pilot projects, testing both piloted and unmanned operations for cargo delivery, supply transport, and emergency services. Companies like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have already announced their participation, signaling a significant step towards commercial electric air travel.</p>

The land bridge will feature a natural gas pipeline and new port terminals, offering an alternative route for energy products and enhancing reliability for global trade. The Rio Indo dam project, costing $1.6 billion, aims to supplement Lake Gatun's water supply, though it will require relocating 2,500 residents and won't be completed before the next El Niño.</p>
