          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is championing the implementation of a targeted prostate cancer screening program, suggesting it could save countless lives. The proposal, detailed in a report by Prostate Cancer Research, would focus on men at the highest risk, such as Black men and those with a family history of the disease. While Sunak argues the initiative is affordable and urgent, some medical experts remain cautious, citing risks of unnecessary treatment from false positives. The debate continues as the UK's National Screening Committee reconsiders its official stance on routine screening.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant shift in global energy trade, Indian refiners are increasingly paying for Russian crude oil using the Chinese yuan. This move, driven by Western sanctions on Russia and U.S. trade policies, not only strengthens economic ties between India, Russia, and China but also boosts the yuan's status as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. India has saved billions by purchasing discounted Russian oil, which now constitutes about a third of its crude imports. This strategic pivot underscores a realignment of economic alliances, challenging the traditional dominance of the dollar in international energy transactions.</p>

          <p>An artist from Mississippi, Samuel Ingram, has gained widespread attention for his powerful portrait of the late Charlie Kirk, which was featured prominently at Kirk's memorial. The painting, which depicts Kirk in a reflective, prayer-like pose, was created as a personal tribute following a brief interaction the artist had with the Turning Point USA founder last year. Despite receiving death threats and losing over 100,000 social media followers, Ingram's work also attracted over a million new followers. The artist states his motivation was to honor Kirk's legacy and was driven by faith rather than politics.</p>

The project, which will be Google's largest AI hub outside of the United States, includes the construction of a 1-gigawatt data center capacity across three campuses. This significant investment comes as global demand for cloud services and AI infrastructure surges. The deal was announced by Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and follows a year of discussions with local officials, positioning India as a key player in the global AI landscape.</p>

The mission saw the Super Heavy booster separate and perform a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship upper stage reached the edge of space before its own planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This successful test marks the final flight of the current prototype.

          <p>Following an "unprecedented" year for wildfire risk, a multi-agency summit is being held in the Scottish Highlands to address the devastating impact of recent blazes. The meeting, hosted by the Scottish government, will bring together the fire service, land management groups, and environmental organizations. The goal is to review the response to fires that burned over 27,000 acres in the Cairngorms and develop strategies to improve resilience and prevent future outbreaks.

          <p>A 16-year-old student from Inverclyde, Cameron McGerr, is campaigning for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. McGerr believes he might have been able to help his father, who died from a cardiac arrest, if he had been trained in the life-saving skill. After successfully persuading his own school to introduce the training, he shared his powerful story with Members of the Scottish Parliament. His campaign, called "Pulse of Life," aims to equip all young people with the confidence and ability to act in a medical emergency.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully restored a complete version of the ancient Chinese masterpiece "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The original 4th-century work by calligrapher Wang Xianzhi had only survived in fragments, with just a quarter of its verses intact. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the surviving 250 characters, the team used artificial intelligence to replicate the artist's style and generate the missing text. This innovative project resulted in a full 919-character scroll, demonstrating the potential of AI to preserve and revitalize cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost the number of blood donors, particularly among young people, a new campaign in the UK will encourage driving licence applicants to register. The joint initiative by the DVLA and NHS Blood and Transplant will include a link to the blood donor registry in emails sent to millions of applicants each year. With over half of regular donors being over 45, the program aims to reach a new generation at the age of 17, when they can both learn to drive and begin donating blood, helping to address a challenging national shortage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, showcasing the advantages of their record-breaking $415 million payroll. Despite stranding 11 runners and a confusing inning-ending double play that cost them a run, the Dodgers' talent prevailed. Key contributions came from high-value players, including a go-ahead solo home run from first baseman Freddie Freeman and eight scoreless innings from pitcher Blake Snell. The win demonstrated that the team's immense financial investment can overcome in-game adversity and secure crucial postseason victories.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a masterful and historic performance to lead his team to a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS opener. Over eight dominant innings, Snell allowed only one hit and struck out ten batters, facing the minimum number of hitters. His performance was crucial, especially after a bizarre fourth-inning double play nullified a potential grand slam for the Dodgers. Snell's outing, one of the greatest in Dodgers postseason history, ensured the team could overcome the strange play and a late-game scare from the bullpen to take a 1-0 series lead.</p>
