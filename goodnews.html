          <p>Intel shares increased by 6% following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking an equity stake in the chipmaker. President Trump indicated the government aims for about 10% ownership, though White House officials clarified that discussions are ongoing and no deal is finalized. This move reflects a shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government potentially gaining a non-voting stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. Intel, crucial for advanced chip production, has been slowing its Ohio factory construction, making government backing significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, have filed a lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies. The plaintiffs argue that these policies violate their constitutional rights by perpetuating a fossil fuel-based electricity sector, leading to increased climate impacts like floods and extreme heat. The article highlights a lead plaintiff's personal experience of displacement due to climate-related events. This case seeks to declare two state laws unconstitutional, potentially forcing Wisconsin to accelerate its transition to carbon-free energy.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated possible interest rate cuts, noting "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies are shifting economic risks. In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell stated that with policy in "restrictive territory," adjusting the stance "may warrant" changes. While the labor market remains strong, he cited rising downside dangers and inflation risks from tariffs. This article highlights Powell's cautious approach, emphasizing the Fed's independence in decision-making, despite political pressure for lower rates, and reflects on lessons learned from past inflation.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on US goods, following a phone call with President Donald Trump. This decision, effective September 1, aims to re-establish free trade for most compliant goods under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). However, Canada will maintain 25% levies on American autos, steel, and aluminum. The article notes this move comes amidst ongoing trade negotiations and a scheduled review of the USMCA next year, with economists warning of disruptive impacts from US tariffs on Canadian industries.

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced skepticism about lowering interest rates, despite Chair Jerome Powell's recent hints at potential cuts. Hammack emphasized the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring inflation back to target, noting that inflation has been above target for four years. She expressed concern that accommodative policies could reignite inflationary pressures. This article highlights a differing perspective within the Fed, with Hammack, who will be a voter in 2026, prioritizing inflation control over immediate rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold, traditionally a safe-haven asset, is experiencing unprecedented interest, particularly in gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as investors seek to hedge against market risk and volatility. Driven by concerns over tariffs and inflation, global gold ETFs saw $3.2 billion in inflows in July, on track for their second-strongest year. The article notes that despite these inflows, gold ETF allocations are still a small percentage of overall equity market hedges, suggesting significant room for further growth.
