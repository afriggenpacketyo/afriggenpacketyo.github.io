          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting several potential candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is reportedly also advocating for reforms at the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and organically shrink its large bond portfolio. The process occurs as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for interest rate cuts ahead of its upcoming policy meeting.</p>

          <p>At its annual event, Apple unveiled the new iPhone 17 lineup, featuring price hikes across all models despite recently receiving tariff relief from the Trump administration. The company introduced the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, a redesigned iPhone 17 Pro, and updated Apple Watch and AirPods Pro models with new health and AI features. By raising prices, Apple is reinforcing its premium brand identity, signaling that it is passing innovation costs to consumers rather than leveraging tariff breaks for savings.</p>

          <p>New estimates based on August inflation data suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would represent a modest increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025, raising the average monthly retirement check by about $54. However, retirees express concern that the adjustment may not be sufficient to cover rising expenses, particularly with potential increases in Medicare premiums also expected for the upcoming year.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American infrastructure projects funded by a $550 billion Japanese investment. This arrangement is part of a broader trade deal where Japan agreed to the investment in exchange for a 15% baseline tariff rate. Once Japan recoups its initial investment, the profit-sharing model will shift heavily in favor of the U.S., which will then receive 90% of the profits, helping to fund domestic manufacturing priorities.</p>

          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that caused WBD's stock to surge by over 25%. The potential takeover follows the recent merger of Paramount and Skydance, led by David Ellison, and signals a significant consolidation move within the rapidly transforming media industry. This development comes as major media companies are restructuring their assets to better compete in the streaming era, with WBD itself planning to separate its TV networks from its studio business.</p>

          <p>The race for the UK Labour Party's deputy leadership has narrowed to a two-person contest between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. The only other candidate, Bell Riberio-Addy, failed to secure the necessary nominations from fellow Members of Parliament to advance. The contest was initiated after Angela Rayner resigned, and the winner will serve as a key link between the party's leadership and its membership, with a vote expected to conclude in late October.</p>

          <p>Waymond Jordan, now a star running back for USC, has had a remarkable journey from being an overlooked high school recruit with no major scholarship offers. After betting on himself by attending junior college at Hutchinson Community College, he overcame injuries and redshirted a year to develop into a top prospect. His patience and perseverance paid off, leading to offers from several major programs before he ultimately chose USC, where he has quickly become a key player in the team's potent rushing attack.</p>

          <p>A recent Tesla proxy filing reveals that the majority of CEO Elon Musk's immense wealth is now derived from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, rather than his Tesla stock. SpaceX is reportedly valued at $400 billion and xAI at $200 billion, making his stakes in them worth more than his current Tesla holdings. Tesla's board is using this fact to justify a new, potentially record-breaking pay package, arguing it is necessary to keep Musk focused on the automaker rather than his more valuable private ventures.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has dropped to 6.35%, its lowest point since last October and the largest weekly decline in a year. This decrease in borrowing costs has led to a surge in demand from homebuyers, with purchase applications rising to their highest level since July. The falling rates are attributed to signs of a weakening labor market, which has caused the Treasury yields that influence mortgage rates to move lower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has maintained and extended restrictions on the use of 'less-lethal' weapons like foam projectiles and tear gas by federal agents at protests in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera ruled that federal officers had used these weapons indiscriminately and with 'surprising savagery' against peaceful protesters, journalists, and legal observers. The ruling affirms that such force is prohibited unless necessary to stop an immediate and serious threat of physical harm, stating that the First Amendment demands better protection.</p>
