          <p>Israel's government has officially approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas, marking a significant step toward ending the two-year war in Gaza. The deal, announced after declarations by U.S. President Donald Trump and a Hamas negotiator, includes the withdrawal of Israeli military forces and the release of all remaining hostages. As part of the transition, Gaza's Civil Defense has warned citizens to avoid border areas until the Israeli military withdrawal is officially confirmed to ensure their safety.</p>

          <p>Councils across London are set to receive £36.5 million in new government funding to address the city's growing homelessness crisis this winter. The funds are designated to support rough sleepers and families in temporary accommodation, as one in 50 Londoners is currently homeless. While the investment has been welcomed by the Mayor of London and charities like Crisis, advocates are calling for a long-term strategy to tackle the root causes of the issue, especially as a record number of homeless deaths were reported in 2024.</p>

          <p>German long-distance runner Lea Meyer's recent vulnerable interview has brought renewed attention to the importance of mental health in competitive sports. Sports psychologist Johanna Belz notes that while Germany has made progress in destigmatizing mental health issues, the culture remains overly focused on performance, often at the expense of the athlete's well-being. Meyer's statement that her value as a person is not defined by her athletic results is seen as a significant moment for promoting a healthier, more holistic identity for athletes.</p>

          <h2>Green Turtle Population Rebounds in Major Conservation Success</h2>

          <p>The green turtle, once on the brink of extinction, has seen its population rebound significantly due to decades of global conservation efforts. Previously listed as endangered since the 1980s due to extensive hunting, the species has now been downgraded to "Least Concern" on the IUCN Red List. This success is attributed to measures such as protecting nesting sites, reducing accidental capture in fishing nets, and raising public awareness. However, scientists caution that ongoing threats like habitat loss and climate change require continued vigilance.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area, requiring them to register biometric data like fingerprints and a photo on their first entry. While EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel by eventually replacing passport stamps, concerns have been raised about potential delays and queues during the initial registration phase at ports, airports, and train terminals.</p>

          <p>India has announced it will reopen its embassy in Kabul, upgrading its technical mission four years after it was closed following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The decision was revealed during a meeting between India's Foreign Minister and his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, during his landmark visit to India. This diplomatic move signals a significant policy shift for New Delhi, which does not officially recognize the Taliban government but remains a key provider of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The Pima County Sheriff's Department in Arizona is using a new AI program called Draft One to help deputies write incident reports more efficiently. The system transcribes audio from body cameras to generate a first draft, which deputies then review and edit, reducing report-writing time from 30 minutes to just five. While the department sees AI as a tool to increase productivity amid resource shortages, public safety accountability groups raise concerns about potential inaccuracies and the lack of large-scale data on the technology's true benefits.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who described their so-called "golden generation" squad as "egotistical losers." While Rooney acknowledged the team's failure to win a major tournament, he disagreed with the characterization, stating that the players worked hard and tried their best but ultimately fell short. He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and a more positive relationship with the media, rather than a superior attitude.</p>
