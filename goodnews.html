          <h2>NATO Members Reportedly Agree to Increase Defense Spending to 5% of GDP</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 12:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a long-sought benchmark by the US. This decision, reached ahead of a major alliance summit, aims to address concerns that the US has been shouldering too much of Europe's security burden. Spain initially sought to block the measure but later dropped its opposition after securing an exemption. The agreement stipulates that member nations, except Spain, will have until 2035 to meet the 5% target, with at least 3.5% allocated for core military needs and an additional 1.5% for related expenditure. This development suggests a strengthened commitment to collective defense among NATO members, contributing to a moderately optimistic outlook for transatlantic security cooperation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran after the strikes, urging Iran to pursue diplomacy and warning that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be "suicidal." Rubio emphasized that the mission was not an attack on the Iranian people or a regime change effort but aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear capabilities. He highlighted that the U.S. is prepared to negotiate if Iran chooses the path of diplomacy. Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie noted that the U.S. has plans to clear the Strait of Hormuz if Iran attempts to block it. Rubio's statements suggest a willingness to de-escalate tensions through diplomatic means, fostering moderate optimism regarding potential future negotiations.</p>

          <p>An analyst argues that Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites was the right one, highlighting the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and the regime's history of supporting terrorism. The article suggests that Iran's military capabilities are weaker than often perceived and that the strikes have significantly set back its nuclear program. The analyst acknowledges the potential for retaliation but believes that Iran's leaders are unlikely to risk direct confrontation with the United States. While acknowledging Trump's flaws, the author applauds his decisive action and the clarity with which he addressed the situation. The positive assessment of Trump's actions and the belief that Iran is unlikely to escalate contribute to a moderately optimistic outlook.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the US is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not with Iran itself, following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Vance stated that the strikes have substantially set back Iran's nuclear program, making it more difficult for them to build a nuclear weapon. He also addressed the possibility of Iranian retaliation, asserting that the US would respond with "overwhelming force." Vance emphasized that the Trump administration is not seeking regime change but is focused on eliminating the Iranian nuclear program. The clarification of US objectives and the warning against retaliation contribute to a moderately optimistic outlook.</p>
