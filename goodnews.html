          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. Potter was sacked after just eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table. Nuno, who previously managed Nottingham Forest and led them to their highest league finish in decades, expressed his pride in joining the club. His immediate goal is to enhance the team's competitiveness, with his first match scheduled against Everton.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the American dream of homeownership increasingly out of reach due to high prices and interest rates, modular home construction is emerging as a potential solution. Companies like Colorado-based Fading West utilize factory-based assembly lines to build homes, claiming to reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional methods. This approach not only addresses the national housing shortage but has also been deployed for disaster relief, such as providing temporary housing for victims of the 2023 Maui wildfires. The industry aims to disrupt traditional homebuilding by offering a faster, more sustainable, and affordable product.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread negative sentiment and concerns over inflation, the U.S. economy is showing surprising resilience, potentially bolstered by a strong stock market. Recent data indicates robust consumer spending, income growth, and a rise in new home sales, which some economists attribute to the "wealth effect" from Wall Street's record highs. However, this strength could be fragile, as the top 10% of earners own 87% of the market, leaving the broader economy vulnerable if stocks decline. This situation creates a precarious balance where positive market performance is currently offsetting other recessionary pressures like stagnant job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Affordability has become the central issue in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, with Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill sparring over the state's sales tax. Ciattarelli has criticized Sherrill for not ruling out a tax increase during a recent debate, a comment he claims proves she is unaffordable for the state. Sherrill's campaign has since clarified that a sales tax hike is "off the table" and has focused on her plan to declare a state of emergency on utility costs. The debate highlights the intense focus on New Jersey's cost of living as both candidates attempt to position themselves as the fiscally responsible choice for voters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Effectively managing workplace conflicts is crucial for professional success, and communication experts suggest memorizing key phrases can help navigate awkward situations. To initiate a difficult conversation, phrases like "I'm seeking clarity" can reduce defensiveness and align goals. When approached with a problem, asking "What does success look like?" helps in understanding objectives before offering solutions. During a disagreement, leading with empathy by saying "It makes sense that you feel that way" can de-escalate tensions and show that you are actively listening, fostering a more collaborative and influential presence at work.</p>

          <h2>Dating Apps Increasingly Turn to AI for Matchmaking Amid User Burnout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major players in the online dating industry, including Bumble and Match Group, are integrating artificial intelligence to act as a matchmaker in response to widespread user swipe fatigue. The new approach aims to move beyond superficial profiles by using AI to analyze user values, goals, and beliefs to suggest more compatible partners. While companies hope this will inject more humanity into the process, experts remain skeptical, noting that romantic chemistry is complex and unpredictable. Past experiments have shown that the suggestion of compatibility can be more influential than actual compatibility, raising questions about whether AI can truly crack the code of human connection.</p>

          <h2>Six-Year-Old's Crossed Eyes Lead to Discovery and Successful Treatment of Brain Tumor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 08:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When 6-year-old Imani Dell's eyes suddenly became crossed, her mother's concern led to an emergency room visit that revealed a golf-ball sized brain tumor. Doctors at Holtz Children's Hospital diagnosed her with medulloblastoma, a fast-growing cancer, and successfully performed surgery to remove the mass. Imani then endured a difficult year of treatment, including 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy. Having recently finished her treatment, Imani is now in second grade and recovering well, with her family celebrating her return to a normal, healthy childhood.</p>

          <h2>Advanced Cockpit Alerts Emerge as Key Technology to Prevent Runway Collisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a recent spike in serious near-collisions at U.S. airports, aerospace company Honeywell is developing advanced cockpit alerts to give pilots more time to react to runway hazards. The new system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide automated audio and visual warnings of potential collisions on the ground, a critical phase of flight where seconds count. While not yet required by regulators, safety experts and some airlines like Alaska and Southwest have embraced such technology. The goal is to add another layer to the aviation industry's "Swiss cheese" safety model to prevent rare but catastrophic accidents.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Principle of Free Speech Must Protect Offensive and Hateful Expression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reflecting on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, this opinion article argues for the vital importance of protecting even offensive speech under the First Amendment. The author recounts the pain this caused for Holocaust survivors in the community, but quotes the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right to march. The lawyer, who is Jewish, argued that the real client was the First Amendment itself. The piece concludes that if speech is denied because it is offensive, officials gain the power to prevent any speech they dislike, undermining the core principle of free expression.</p>

          <h2>Improper Recycling of Lead-Acid Batteries Poses a Major Global Health Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries. In many low- and middle-income countries, used car batteries are broken open and the lead is melted down in unsafe conditions, releasing toxic dust that contaminates communities. However, this is a solvable problem, as demonstrated by countries like Brazil, which successfully formalized its recycling industry through policy changes. By altering economic incentives, such as removing taxes on scrap and implementing manufacturer take-back programs, governments can steer batteries away from dangerous backyard smelters and into safer, regulated facilities.</p>

          <h2>UK Chancellor Advocates for Youth Migration Deal with EU to Boost Economic Forecasts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an ambitious youth migration scheme with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. Reeves wants the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential growth from such a deal into its forecasts, which could reduce the need for future tax hikes or spending cuts. The proposed scheme, which would allow young people aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK or EU for a few years, has been criticized by opponents as a partial return to freedom of movement.</p>
