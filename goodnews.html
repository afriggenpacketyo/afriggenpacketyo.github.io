          <p>A technical glitch at Fidelity Investments temporarily prevented some investors from accessing their accounts during a significant market rally. This outage primarily affected day traders, institutional investors, and options investors who actively manage their portfolios and need real-time access to capitalize on market swings. While long-term investors may not have been significantly impacted, the disruption highlights the potential risks associated with relying solely on digital platforms for financial management. Financial advisors recommend remaining calm during such events, as technical issues at brokerages have occurred in the past.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. This provision is part of President Trump's tax and spending package, aiming to address concerns from lawmakers in high-tax states. The current SALT deduction limit, set at $10,000 by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), is scheduled to expire after 2025. The proposed increase could provide tax relief to some residents in states with high income and property taxes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts surged to a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on imports. This influx of revenue helped to reduce the budget deficit for the month, which stood at $258.4 billion, up 23% from the previous year. However, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.05 trillion, 13% higher than the previous year, with high interest rates contributing significantly to budgetary burdens. Net interest on the national debt totaled $89 billion in April, second only to Social Security in terms of expenditures.</p>

          <h2>Trump China Trade Deal: Tariff Pause Expected to Cause Surge in Freight Shipments and Price Hikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 15:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The temporary trade deal between the U.S. and China, which suspends reciprocal tariffs, is expected to lead to a surge in freight shipments from China to the U.S. Retailers and logistics executives anticipate importers will rush to move forward with shipments during the 90-day pause, potentially causing container rates to increase. While the tariff pause offers a short-term reprieve, the 30% tariffs will still make for an expensive back-to-school and holiday season for most Americans, as prices are still expected to go up. Critical industries also report low inventory levels, and the tariff pause will cause a scurry of activity to replenish those inventories.</p>

He also praised China's role in engaging with countries often overlooked by others, and is seeking Chinese investments in Brazilian infrastructure projects.

          <p>Shares of KindlyMD, a healthcare company, skyrocketed after announcing a merger with Nakamoto Holdings, a bitcoin investment company founded by David Bailey, a cryptocurrency advisor to President Trump. The newly formed company secured significant funding and plans to acquire bitcoin-native companies to build a global network of bitcoin holdings. Bailey's influence extends beyond business, as he has visited the White House multiple times and advises on digital asset policy. The merger represents a strategic shift for KindlyMD, with the healthcare operation eventually playing a smaller role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to reduce tariffs on each other for 90 days, providing relief for investors and retailers concerned about a trade war. The temporary truce will see the U.S. lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10%. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers due to weeks of uncertainty. The 90-day deadline for a more lasting trade deal could fuel further market volatility. The end result of the provisional agreement is a return to tariff rates that were in place before the president launched a global trade war on April 2.</p>
