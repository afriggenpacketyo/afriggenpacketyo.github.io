          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Des Moines, Iowa, to kick off the "America250" events, a yearlong celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The choice of Iowa, the traditional first state in the Republican presidential nominating process, is seen as symbolic of his connection to the American heartland. While the visit is officially for the anniversary event, it also fuels speculation about the future of the Republican party, even as the 22nd Amendment prevents Trump from running in 2028. The event underscores his continued influence within the GOP.</p>

          <p>The United States economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, with significant gains seen in the government and health care sectors. Despite this strong performance, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year due to potential impacts from trade tariffs. The robust job growth makes it likely the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates for the time being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While current high-yield savings accounts offer slightly higher returns on paper, their variable rates are expected to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed rate, offering protection against future rate drops. Given the high probability of a Fed rate cut, securing a competitive CD rate now could prove more beneficial over the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market is showing signs of revival after a prolonged downturn, largely spurred by the successful debut of crypto company Circle, whose stock has surged since going public. This, along with strong performance from other recent tech IPOs like CoreWeave, is providing much-needed returns for venture capital firms. While major private companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain on the sidelines, the recent activity has created cautious optimism that the "liquidity drought" for startups may be ending. The market's health is a crucial indicator for the broader tech ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the strong June jobs report vindicates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's decision to hold off on interest rate cuts, despite pressure from President Trump. The better-than-expected job growth and lower unemployment rate suggest the economy does not require immediate stimulus. Cramer also noted that the stock market has become overbought, suggesting that investors might consider trimming profits from high-performing stocks. The analysis underscores the tension between the White House's economic demands and the Federal Reserve's data-driven monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the historical tendency for each generation of adults to express concern and often disdain for the younger generation, a practice documented in publications like The Atlantic for over a century. From worries about dancing and bare legs in the 1920s to critiques of hippies in the 1970s, the pattern of generational judgment is consistent. The author reflects on this tradition, questioning how to write about generational trends with empathy and nuance rather than condescension. The piece suggests that true understanding requires seeing young people not as a monolithic problem but as individuals navigating the unique challenges of their time.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic delivered a commanding performance to defeat British player Dan Evans in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0. Djokovic's serving was nearly perfect, preventing Evans from gaining any foothold in the match. The win marks Djokovic's 99th match victory at Wimbledon and sets up a third-round contest against fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic. The 38-year-old is aiming to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon men's singles titles and secure a record 25th Grand Slam overall.</p>

He reflects on how the Republican party has successfully appealed to this demographic and shares a story of a respectful on-stage debate with a fan in a MAGA shirt, which taught him a lesson about avoiding generalizations and maintaining dialogue.</p>
