          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy defended President Trump's possible acceptance of a Qatari-offered jet for presidential use, shifting blame to Boeing for delays in providing a new Air Force One. McCarthy argued that Trump, as a businessman, seeks deals that avoid taxpayer expense, while emphasizing the need for a new presidential aircraft due to the age of the current planes. He suggested Boeing should lease a temporary plane, even the Qatari jet, to address the delay and remove implications of a gift. Several Republicans have expressed concern about the offer.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Virginia has ordered the immediate release of Georgetown academic Badar Khan Suri from ICE detention, stating it was in the public interest to disrupt the chilling effect on protected speech. Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, was detained for two months, with immigration officials revoking his student visa based on his father-in-law's past association with Hamas and his social media posts supporting Palestine. The judge found that the government did not submit sufficient evidence to support its claims. The Trump administration had determined that Khan Suri's presence in the US would have potentially serious foreign policy consequences.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a bill that would make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new tax reductions. The proposed bill includes a $4,000 deduction for those 65 and older, an increase in the standard deduction, and an extension of the Child Tax Credit. It also seeks to eliminate the 1099-K reporting rule and taxes on tips and overtime pay. Democrats oppose the bill due to cuts to Medicaid and food stamps and the temporary nature of some tax cuts.</p>
