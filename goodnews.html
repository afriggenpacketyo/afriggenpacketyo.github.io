        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol through fermented fruit, equivalent to about one small beer for a human daily. Researchers observed this behavior in multiple national parks, noting that the animals often consume the alcoholic fruits socially. These findings support the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting that human attraction to alcohol is not just a cultural phenomenon but may have evolved from our primate ancestors' dietary habits. The study opens further questions about the potential social or physiological benefits for the chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country on Earth, a distinction Finns themselves often find puzzling. Experts suggest the ranking, based on life satisfaction rather than daily joy, reflects a deep sense of contentment rooted in a well-functioning society with strong social support systems. Public services like Helsinki's central library, which offers free access to everything from books to 3D printers, exemplify the societal trust and investment in citizens. This focus on community well-being, combined with a close connection to nature and traditions like saunas, fosters a stable environment where people feel secure and cared for.</p>

          <p>Nottinghamshire Police arrested two 25-year-old women on suspicion of possessing Class A and B drugs with intent to supply. The arrests occurred after officers on a routine patrol stopped a car in the city center on Thursday evening. A search of the vehicle uncovered a significant quantity of cannabis, as well as substances believed to be cocaine and MDMA, alongside cash and mobile phones. A subsequent search of a related property led to the seizure of more drugs and paraphernalia, confirming officers' initial suspicions about the vehicle's involvement in illegal activities.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their third Women's Rugby World Cup title with a dominant 33-13 victory over Canada in front of a record-breaking crowd of 81,885 at Twickenham. After conceding an early try, England responded with a sensational solo score from full-back Ellie Kildunne and asserted control through their powerful forward pack. The win extends England's record unbeaten streak to 33 games and avenges their loss to New Zealand in the final three years ago. The victory marks a historic moment for women's sport in England, capping a memorable year for the nation's female athletes.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory was built on a deliberate effort to foster a positive and inclusive team environment, a contrast to some players' negative experiences in the previous campaign. Head coach John Mitchell and the players cultivated a culture of unity through team-bonding activities like movie nights and by ensuring non-selected players remained integral to the squad. Small rituals, from players getting commemorative tattoos to a shared book club, helped manage the pressure of being tournament hosts and favorites. This focus on camaraderie and "being where our feet are" was crucial in their successful run to winning the championship.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the first Black woman to be hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has died at the age of 92. A pioneering journalist, Davis began her career in the 1960s, a time when the industry was dominated by white men, and became a trusted and unflappable presence in Bay Area news for decades. She covered pivotal moments from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, winning eight regional Emmy Awards. Colleagues and public figures like Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee remembered her as a mentor who "opened doors for a generation" of diverse journalists through her courage and integrity.</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. He was the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot to fly in World War II, completing 21 combat missions over Europe after joining at age 19. Hardy went on to serve with distinction in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, retiring in 1971. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, and Hardy became a champion of their legacy, helping accept the Congressional Gold Medal on the group's behalf in 2007 for their patriotism in the face of discrimination.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Army veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives comfortably on a monthly income of around $4,000. His income is sourced from VA disability, the GI Bill for his master's degree, and part-time work teaching English. Ryan states that the lower cost of living removes the "monetary pressure" he felt in the U.S., allowing him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than just survival. He praises Vietnam for its safety and calm atmosphere, contrasting it with the feeling of being unable to get ahead financially in America.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), arguing it is the best path forward for shareholders. This comes after a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023 prompted CCO to divest its international assets, transforming it into a U.S.-focused company. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has continued to underperform its peers, and Anson believes a sale to a strategic buyer or private equity firm is more compelling than a slow public market turnaround. The firm notes CCO's high debt and slow conversion to more profitable digital billboards as persistent challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado-based Fading West is positioning its modular home construction as a solution to the nationwide housing affordability crisis. By building homes in a 110,000-square-foot factory, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional on-site building. This method addresses labor shortages and weather delays, allowing for a more efficient process. The company recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires, showcasing the potential of factory-built housing for both disaster relief and creating more attainable homes.</p>
