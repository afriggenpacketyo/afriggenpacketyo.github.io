          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following the announcement of a plan to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy would allow for faster delivery of military aid, as equipment could be sourced from European allies rather than directly from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the administration faces bipartisan pressure to take stronger action against Russia. Lawmakers are pushing for sanctions that would target Russia's economy and countries that support its war effort.</p>

          <p>FIFA has agreed in principle to introduce mandatory rest periods for professional soccer players, a significant development in the effort to protect them from injury and burnout. Following talks with the global players' union, Fifpro, the governing body acknowledged the need for a minimum 72-hour gap between games and a three-week break at the end of each season. This consensus comes amid growing concerns over an expanded fixture calendar, including the new 32-team Club World Cup, which had prompted legal action from player unions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid the geopolitical power struggle with China over rare earth metals, recycling electronic waste is emerging as a crucial strategy for the United States. Next-generation recycling companies are developing innovative ways to extract valuable materials like neodymium, gold, and copper from discarded electronics such as laptops and smartphones. This "urban mining" offers a way to build a more resilient domestic supply chain, reducing dependence on foreign sources, particularly China, which currently dominates the market. The approach is gaining strategic importance as trade policies and global tensions disrupt traditional supply lines. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of genetic genealogy, once a hobby for ancestry enthusiasts, has become a revolutionary tool for law enforcement in cracking cold cases. The technique involves using DNA from a crime scene to build a family tree through public genealogy databases, leading investigators to suspects like the Golden State Killer. This method, pioneered by researchers like Barbara Rae-Venter, provides crucial investigative leads that traditional detective work can then confirm. While it has raised privacy concerns, the practice has proven highly effective in identifying and capturing previously elusive serial criminals.</p>

These upgrades directly address critical failures identified during the 2024 incident, where a shooter used a commercial drone undetected and communication lines were fragmented.

The move is part of an effort to accelerate the transition away from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban. The government also announced funding to improve charging infrastructure, particularly for those without private driveways.</p>
