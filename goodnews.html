          <p>An opinion piece argues that artificial intelligence will fundamentally transform the wealth management industry, leading to the concept of an "Advisory Firm of 1." AI-powered tools and autonomous agents are expected to handle most operational tasks, from client onboarding to portfolio adjustments, allowing a single human advisor to serve hundreds of clients. This increased efficiency will not only improve the quality and personalization of financial advice but also democratize access for middle-income families by lowering costs. The author suggests firms that fail to adopt AI will not survive in the medium term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent comments have intensified speculation about who will next lead the Federal Reserve, with prediction markets elevating the odds for Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised "both Kevins," referring to his National Economic Council Director Hassett and former Fed Governor Warsh, while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is not interested in the job. Following the interview, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave both Hassett and Warsh a 35% chance of being nominated. The discussion is fueled by the upcoming expiration of current Chair Jerome Powell's term in May 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to submit a weekly list of five accomplishments. The directive was initiated in February by Elon Musk during his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency, with Musk threatening that failure to comply would be considered a resignation. The practice was part of a broader initiative to reduce the federal workforce but faced resistance from multiple agencies from the outset. OPM Director Scott Kupor stated that managers have other tools to stay informed about their teams' work and the office would no longer manage the process.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime, including a significant 14.9% decrease in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. Property crime also fell by 8.1%, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year drop. While experts note that aggravated assaults remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, the overall trend reflects a continued decline from the spike seen immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Roku has launched a new ad-free subscription streaming service called "Howdy" for $2.99 per month, marking a strategic shift for the company known for its free, ad-supported content. The new service will feature 10,000 hours of movies and TV shows from partners like Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, alongside Roku's original programming. CEO Anthony Wood described Howdy as a low-cost offering designed to complement, rather than compete with, premium streaming services. The move comes as Roku continues to grow its platform revenue, which increased 18% year-over-year in its latest quarterly report.</p>

          <p>An article from CBS News suggests that 1-ounce gold bars could be a strategic investment amid current economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and stock market volatility. It cites a recent forecast from Citi analysts who raised their short-term gold price target, driven by a negative U.S. economic outlook. The article also notes that gold has historically served as a hedge against inflation, which has been ticking upward again. The 1-ounce bar format is highlighted for its liquidity, tradability, and lower premiums compared to fractional coins, offering flexibility for individual investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he had "productive" talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, focusing on sanctions against Russia, defense cooperation, and drone production. The conversation comes as a U.S. envoy prepares to visit Moscow ahead of a Friday deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe secondary sanctions. Zelenskyy noted that Moscow is particularly "sensitive" to the sanctions threat. The discussion signals a repair in the relationship between the two leaders, which had soured earlier in the year, following a U.S. plan to facilitate weapons sales to Ukraine.</p>
