          <p>A recent wellness roundup provides several actionable health tips, reflecting a growing trend of Americans, particularly young adults, reducing alcohol consumption due to health concerns. The article suggests simple swaps like choosing popcorn over chips for its fiber content and working out just twice a week for significant health benefits. Other recommendations include doing a single, high-intensity set at the gym, brushing teeth before breakfast to protect enamel, and leaving smartphones outside the bedroom to improve sleep quality.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong who fled the city in 2020. Hui, who faces criminal charges related to the 2019 protests and had a police bounty placed on him, confirmed that he and his family have received protection visas. While expressing gratitude to Australia, Hui conveyed the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return home and urged the Australian government to do more to help other activists who remain jailed in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, secured a 41-24 victory over Argentina in their Rugby Championship opener, a win that propelled them back to the number one spot in the world rankings for the first time in four years. Despite a strong start that saw them lead 31-10 at halftime, the All Blacks had to withstand a determined second-half comeback from the Pumas. Late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho ultimately sealed the win, extending New Zealand's undefeated record against Argentina on Argentinian soil.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An author reflects on her evolving relationship with Renaissance art, moving from youthful indifference to a profound connection driven by life experiences like trauma and motherhood. Initially dismissing the art form as unrelatable, she found new meaning in the works of artists like Caravaggio and Michelangelo after personal hardships and during her pregnancy. The essay posits that understanding the deep emotional complexity of such art requires a certain level of lived experience, which breaks down cynicism and allows for a more earnest engagement with timeless themes.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully captured a notorious serial killer, known as the "canal killer," through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, was identified through genetic genealogy, but detectives remained skeptical until they could obtain a direct DNA sample. Posing for a casual meeting, a detective arranged for Miller to drink from a glass, which was then collected and tested, confirming his DNA matched evidence from the 1990s murders of two women, leading to his arrest and eventual death sentence.</p>

          <h2>China's National Museum Hosts Exhibition Highlighting Russian Identity of Painter Ilya Repin</h2>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is currently hosting an exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a specific focus on emphasizing his "Russianness." The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, showcases 48 oil paintings and numerous sketches from key periods of the artist's life. This framing of Repin's identity comes in contrast to claims from Ukraine's Ministry of Culture, which earlier this year declared the works of the painter, who was born in present-day Ukraine, as part of its own national cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of Angela Craig of Aurora, Colorado, was sparked when a staff member at her husband's dental practice opened a package addressed to him. The package allegedly contained potassium cyanide, and the employee, noticing Angela's symptoms matched those of cyanide poisoning, alerted a business partner who then informed hospital staff. This tip led police to launch a homicide investigation while Angela was still on life support, resulting in the swift arrest of her husband, dentist Dr. James Craig, just hours after her death.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant famous for its celebrity clientele and old-school charm, has died at the age of 90 in his native Belgrade, Serbia. A former professional soccer player and actor, Tana opened his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining haven that became a Hollywood institution frequented by stars from Elizabeth Taylor to George Clooney. Though he sold the restaurant in 2009, its legacy of comfort food, checkered tablecloths, and discreet service has endured as a beloved fixture.</p>

          <p>A long-standing principle in U.S. traffic engineering, the "85th percentile rule," is facing increased scrutiny and modification from state and federal authorities. This rule suggests setting speed limits based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel, a concept critics argue creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits. Amid rising road fatalities, transportation officials are now encouraging a more holistic approach that considers pedestrian safety, road usage, and crash frequency, moving away from a system where drivers effectively set their own speed limits.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that produces highly detailed and vivid 3D images of organs, including the brain, by making the tissue transparent. The technique creates what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. This process allows for a clearer view of the brain's inner workings and creates a stable, glassy solid at low temperatures that can be stored for long-term study without degradation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The game was characterized by a series of mistakes from the Padres, including three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings and a costly defensive error that allowed two runs to score. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's sloppy play to clinch the season series and the potential tiebreaker between the two rivals.</p>
