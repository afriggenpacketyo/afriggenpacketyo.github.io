          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, marking the lowest level since August 2022 and surpassing market expectations. This move represents the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by positive GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which exceeded estimates at 7.4% year-on-year. Despite the rate cut, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, indicating a projected slowdown compared to the previous financial year. The RBI's decision also considers the ongoing downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent reading for April at 3.16%, providing room for monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea's state media reported the successful raising of a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer, which had been damaged during a failed launch attempt in May. The ship is now moored at a pier in the northeastern port of Chongjin, where experts will assess its hull. Kim Jong Un has set a deadline for the "perfect restoration" of the destroyer this month, following his criticism of the initial launch failure as a "criminal act." The ship is Pyongyang's second known destroyer and is reportedly capable of carrying various weapons, including nuclear missiles.</p>

He "strongly" urged the United States to reconsider the tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, while also discussing cooperation on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. Japan is weighing whether to accept a cut in the rates, as the United States resists a full removal of the duties. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk's initial announcement was in response to Trump's statement about terminating governmental subsidies and contracts with Musk's businesses, but the situation remains fluid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing trend of food brands offering products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers are responding to consumer demand for simpler ingredient lists, with some brands launching new ranges featuring natural ingredients. While some nutritionists express concern that this trend may prioritize fewer ingredients over essential nutrients, others argue that the term UPF is not a helpful indicator of health. Food brands are advised to simplify formulas and utilize new processing technologies to create less processed products, with marketing expected to emphasize the virtues of these items.</p>
