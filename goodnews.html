          <p>A new $200 million ballroom is being constructed at the White House, funded primarily by private and corporate donors, including Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir. In exchange for contributions, the Trump administration has discussed offering permanent recognition, such as etching donor names into the building's structure. The fundraising effort is being led by a top political fundraiser for the president in conjunction with the Trust for the National Mall, which allows for tax-deductible donations. While President Trump has stated he is also paying for it, the exact amount of his personal contribution has not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate, U.S. Treasury yields have increased, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high. This counterintuitive market reaction reflects investor sentiment that weighs factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and government debt. Analysts suggest the rise in yields may be linked to improving GDP estimates and calming concerns about the labor market. Investors are now awaiting the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index for further insight into inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors are shifting back into large-cap technology stocks as the 10-year Treasury yield has been rising, even after the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. In this environment, the secular growth offered by Big Tech is seen as a safer bet. On the geopolitical front, President Trump announced a 'very productive call' with Chinese President Xi Jinping, reporting progress on trade, fentanyl, and the approval of a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations. This news suggests that crucial trade discussions remain on solid footing, providing some stability to the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic shift is underway as a growing majority of countries, now totaling 147, officially recognize Palestine as a state. Recently, several Western nations including the UK, France, Australia, and Canada have announced their intention to grant recognition, signaling a change in long-held policy and angering Israeli officials. This movement has gained momentum following the ongoing conflict in Gaza and a recent UN General Assembly vote overwhelmingly supporting a two-state solution. Despite this widespread support, Palestine's bid for full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council.</p>

          <p>A key suspect in the deadly 1982 attack on the Jo Goldenberg Jewish restaurant in Paris has been arrested by Palestinian authorities in the West Bank after more than 40 years. Mahmoud Khader Abed Adra is accused of directing the gun and grenade assault that killed six people and injured over 20. The arrest, facilitated by an international warrant, was praised by French President Emmanuel Macron as a result of 'excellent co-operation' with the Palestinian Authority. French officials are now working to secure his swift extradition to face charges of terrorist murder in a trial expected next year.</p>

          <p>After months of delays, the Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The confirmation fills an eight-month vacancy in the critical diplomatic role just before world leaders convene for the UN General Assembly. Waltz's confirmation proceeded despite earlier controversy over his involvement in a security leak regarding a military strike. During his hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for major reform at the UN but stressed the importance of U.S. participation to counter the influence of China and Russia on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has led to a drop in mortgage rates, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $750,000 mortgage, the monthly payment at the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.13% is approximately $4,560. This is over $450 less per month compared to the payments at the 7.04% rates seen at the beginning of 2025, translating to over $160,000 in interest savings over the life of the loan. The rate reduction enhances affordability for new buyers and presents a compelling refinancing opportunity for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, stated that he supports two additional interest rate cuts before the end of the year. He believes the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a 'one-time effect' rather than a persistent pressure, creating room for more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that while the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation, the current economic conditions warrant further rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

The national average, currently at $3.17, could dip to around $3 per gallon in October. This expected decline is attributed to several factors, including increased oil production from OPEC+, the seasonal switch to a cheaper winter-blend gasoline, and the recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. While hurricane season and tariff uncertainty remain potential risks, the overall outlook for fuel costs is positive for motorists across most of the country. (not investment advice)</p>
