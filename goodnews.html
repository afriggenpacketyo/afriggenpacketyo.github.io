          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting the creation of 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. This endorsement comes after the Biden administration blocked Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. The United Steelworkers union remains opposed to the deal, expressing concerns about job security and the impact on domestic steel-making capacity. The deal would allow U.S. Steel to keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and investors reacted positively, with shares of the company jumping more than 21 percent.</p>

          <p>Google's Gemini AI chatbot is facing criticism for allegedly making "anti-American" claims about Memorial Day, particularly regarding its supposed origins in White supremacy. The Media Research Center (MRC) Free Speech America project highlighted that Gemini suggested Memorial Day is controversial due to issues with "inclusivity and representation" during the Jim Crow era. Gemini also claimed that Memorial Day is intertwined with national identity and patriotism, which can be complex for individuals with differing perspectives on American history and foreign policy. While Gemini acknowledged the holiday's primary purpose is to honor fallen U.S. military personnel, it noted that the history contains elements viewed through the lens of race.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of his upcoming tour dates, including concerts scheduled up to early July 2026, due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, exacerbated by recent performances, has led to problems with his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing as he undergoes physical therapy, and fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. NPH is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting brain-related functions, and is more likely to occur in older people.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a brain disorder called normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which affects his hearing, vision, and balance.
