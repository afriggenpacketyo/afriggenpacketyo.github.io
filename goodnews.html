          <p>G7 finance ministers concluded a meeting without addressing the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. Unlike previous rallies, this climb has been gradual, influenced by factors such as easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration, including potential regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, have also contributed to the positive momentum. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will now allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has largely reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, following a Pentagon review that utilized standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial ban, which included works by authors like Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi, was based on the Navy's own search terms. The new review, employing DOD's criteria, identified only about 20 books requiring removal pending further evaluation by a Defense Department panel. This reversal comes after a Pentagon memo directed military services to remove DEI-related books, aligning with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential risks associated with annuities, examining whether these retirement products can run out of money. While immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide guaranteed income for life, fixed-term, variable, and indexed annuities, as well as those with withdrawal riders, can deplete funds if not managed carefully. The stability of the issuing insurer is also a critical factor, as annuity payments are only as secure as the company's financial health. Diversifying retirement income, choosing a lifetime income annuity, and researching the insurance company are recommended strategies to mitigate the risk of outliving annuity payments.

          <p>The cricket community is discussing whether to allow injury replacements in Test cricket, particularly in the first innings, to avoid matches being ruined due to a team being a player down. While some argue that substitutes would improve fairness and entertainment, others raise concerns about proving genuine injuries and potential abuse of the system. Former players and commentators propose solutions like an independent doctor's assessment and limiting substitutes to the first innings. There is a consensus that any system must prevent teams from faking injuries to gain a tactical advantage.</p>

The Dragon was the first American spacecraft to visit the space station since NASA ended the space shuttle program almost a year earlier. SpaceX, which was founded by Elon Musk, launched over 1,000 lbs. of cargo to the space station with its new Dragon cargo craft. The vessel is actually designed to launch up to 13,000 lbs., but because this was a test flight, it wasn't filled to its maximum capacity. The Dragon brought supplies like food, water and clothing for the space station crew and several student experiments. Also on board were cremated remains of more than 300 people.</p>
