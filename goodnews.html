          <p>The Dalai Lama has affirmed that the 600-year-old institution will continue, stating his office will identify a successor in accordance with Tibetan Buddhist tradition. This announcement, made during his 90th birthday celebrations in Dharamshala, India, is seen as a message to China, which claims authority to name the next spiritual leader. He has consistently maintained that his successor will be found outside of China, a stance that angers Beijing, which views him as a separatist. The declaration puts an end to years of speculation about whether he would be the final Dalai Lama.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death in 1990, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 2-1 decision by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals makes Sockwell eligible for a retrial for the 1988 killing of a former sheriff. The court found a pattern of discriminatory intent, noting that 80% of potential Black jurors were rejected. The original trial judge had overridden a 7-5 jury recommendation for a life sentence, a practice now outlawed in Alabama.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported strong sales for the eighth consecutive month, delivering over 34,000 cars in June amidst a fierce price war in the domestic market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other U.S.-listed competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed more mixed results. The intense competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, is also pressuring Tesla, whose sales in China are projected to decline.

The legislation will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential PFAS products by 2032. 3M, the company that developed the chemicals, has agreed to stop producing them and pay $850 million for cleanup, a victory for a movement inspired by Strande's powerful advocacy.</p>
