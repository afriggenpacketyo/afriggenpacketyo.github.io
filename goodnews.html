          <p>The FDA has approved Teal Health's Teal Wand, the first at-home test for cervical cancer screening, allowing individuals to collect samples themselves. Clinical trials showed the self-administered test has a 96% accuracy rate, comparable to in-office screenings. Teal Health plans to launch the wand in California first, aiming to increase access to care, especially for women in rural areas who face challenges attending in-person appointments. The company has raised $23 million from investors, reflecting growing interest in women's health technology, and is in discussions with carriers about insurance coverage for the test.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved and expanded the use of three natural color additives in response to the Department of Health and Human Services' push to eliminate artificial food dyes. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that this move aims to promote healthier choices by replacing synthetic, petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives. The approved additives include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, which can now be used in a wider range of food products. Some manufacturers, like Tyson Foods, have already begun phasing out artificial dyes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consolidating multiple debts into a single monthly payment can simplify finances and potentially lower costs by reducing interest rates. Several methods exist, including personal consolidation loans, balance transfers to credit cards with promotional 0% APR periods, home equity loans or lines of credit, and debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies. Each option has its own advantages and risks, such as the potential for higher interest rates after promotional periods or the risk of losing a home if payments are not made. Careful evaluation of the total cost over the life of the loan is essential before proceeding.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made a swift inaugural visit to Brussels, meeting with European leaders to emphasize Germany's commitment to unity and addressing key issues such as trade, migration, and defense. Merz's priorities include supporting new trade deals, de-escalating tariff tensions with the US, curbing irregular migration, and strengthening Europe's defense posture. While his approach to migration has raised concerns, international partners have welcomed his focus on defense and economic momentum. The challenge now will be to sell this pivot to a skeptical German public, while maintaining momentum in Brussels.</p>

          <p>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary transit system in the San Francisco Bay Area, shut down all trains for several hours due to a computer networking problem.

The incident comes as BART struggles to attract passengers post-pandemic, with ridership remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels. While train service has resumed, significant delays are expected, and other transit systems are providing assistance to BART riders.</p>

          <p>Despite cultural nostalgia for factory jobs, the American manufacturing sector has significantly declined since its peak in 1979. While 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs, salaries are now in the bottom half of all jobs, and automation has reduced the need for human labor. President Trump's tariffs have not significantly impacted employment in protected sectors, and immigration policies could further affect the sector. Despite political appeal and potential national security arguments, the reality of American manufacturing today does not align with the nostalgic vision of the past.</p>
