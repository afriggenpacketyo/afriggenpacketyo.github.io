This significant victory adds the league championship to their earlier 2025 Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield titles, marking their first league triumph since 1984. A pivotal moment in the game was Wigan's Brad O'Neill receiving a yellow card for a tip tackle, which Hull KR expertly exploited with two quick tries. The team's exceptional performance, characterized by their combative gameplan and execution, underscored their consistent strength throughout the season and the strategic brilliance of coach Willie Peters.</p>

The National Weather Service forecasts 0.5 to 1.5 inches of rain for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with up to 3 inches in higher elevations, from Monday night through Wednesday. While minor road flooding is anticipated during the peak on Tuesday, significant widespread flooding is not expected. This article notes that despite the substantial rainfall, the storm is unlikely to fully alleviate the region's wildfire season, and residents should remain vigilant for potential strong winds and isolated thunderstorms.</p>
