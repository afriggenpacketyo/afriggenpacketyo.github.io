          <p>Garris Fabrics & Fashion, a 78-year-old seamstress shop in West Philadelphia, has received a complete storefront makeover thanks to a city-funded grant program. The business, founded in 1947 and now run by the founder's daughter, Denise Garris, specializes in handcrafted dresses for young girls, continuing a family legacy. The grant, administered by the nonprofit ACHIEVEability, is part of an initiative to revitalize the 60th Street business corridor by assisting small businesses at no cost. Garris hopes the renovation will help preserve her family's four-generation legacy and inspire other local entrepreneurs to seek similar support.</p>

          <p>Chef Jamie Yoo, owner of Abang Yoli in Minnetonka, is introducing Minnesotans to his unique take on Korean cuisine, blending traditional flavors with modern techniques. Originally from Korea, Yoo learned to cook from his mother and grandmother before moving to the U.S. and training under acclaimed chef Gavin Kaysen. His restaurant, which opened earlier this year, features signature items like Korean-style fried chicken and a non-traditional "kimchi-slaw" designed to be approachable for new palates. While focused on his current venture, Yoo dreams of one day opening a fine-dining Korean fusion restaurant.</p>

          <h2>Commercial Airliner Pilot Takes Evasive Action to Avoid Collision with B-52 Bomber</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:48:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A SkyWest airlines pilot was forced to make an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. In a message to passengers, the pilot explained that the military aircraft appeared on a converging course without any prior warning from air traffic control. The B-52, part of the Fifth Bomb Wing, was in the area after conducting a flyover for the North Dakota State Fair. Both the FAA and the Air Force are investigating the incident, which left the pilot shaken but resulted in no injuries to the 76 passengers and four crew members.</p>

          <p>A Chicago Catholic church recently hosted a rare relic of Carlo Acutis, a 15-year-old Italian boy set to become the first millennial saint. Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006, is known as the "patron saint of the internet" for his work creating websites to document eucharistic miracles. St. Hedwig Church in Bucktown, part of a parish named for Acutis, already houses a lock of his hair. For the special event, Archbishop Domenico Sorrentino brought a piece of Acutis's heart from Italy, allowing parishioners to venerate it after a special mass just weeks before his official canonization.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old New Jersey lifeguard, Alex Kaus, has returned to work just three weeks after a freak accident where she was impaled by a beach umbrella. The incident occurred when a gust of wind blew her off a lifeguard stand and onto the metal pole, which went through her shoulder. First responders had to cut the stake to transport her to the hospital. While she is not yet cleared for water duty, Kaus is checking beach badges and hopes to be back on the stand soon. She expressed immense gratitude for her coworkers who provided immediate aid and hopes the incident highlights the important safety role lifeguards play.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Filing for a tax extension provides more time to submit your return but does not postpone the deadline for paying the taxes you owe, which remains April 15. The IRS will charge a late payment penalty and interest on any unpaid balance after this date. To avoid these extra charges, taxpayers who file an extension should estimate their tax liability and pay as much as possible by the original deadline. For those unable to pay their full tax bill, the IRS offers several solutions, including installment agreements, an Offer in Compromise for those in financial hardship, or penalty abatement for eligible filers.

          <p>England has selected left-arm spinner Liam Dawson for the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, marking his return to the format after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger, and was chosen over fellow left-armer Jack Leach. Dawson's inclusion is expected to bolster England's lower-order batting in addition to providing experienced spin bowling. England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and can secure a series victory with a win in Manchester, a feat they have not accomplished since 2018.</p>

          <p>Plans for a major expansion of the Wimbledon tennis site can proceed after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The All England Club's proposal, approved by the Greater London Authority, includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club land. The group Save Wimbledon Park had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected by restrictive covenants. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a "planning judgment rationally exercised," clearing the way for the nearly threefold increase in the site's size.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as seen in the successful Euro 2025, nations from Eastern Europe have struggled to keep pace with their Western counterparts. An analysis suggests that a combination of cultural, political, and economic factors has hindered development in the region. Experts point to a historical lack of investment, societal norms viewing football as a "man's game," and the post-communist collapse of state sponsorship systems as significant barriers. While recent UEFA initiatives are starting to show positive results, a substantial shift in investment and cultural attitudes is still needed for the region to catch up.</p>

Mwangi was arrested Saturday in connection with recent anti-government street protests, with authorities initially accusing him of facilitating terrorist acts. His case drew widespread attention from supporters who feared he was being targeted for his activism. Mwangi, who denies the charges, was freed on bond after his court appearance, telling supporters outside that the president is scared of young people organizing for a better country.</p>
