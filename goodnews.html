          <p>President Trump, during a visit to Saudi Arabia, declared the U.S. would cease nation-building and lecturing other countries, receiving applause but also skepticism. His remarks resonated with some in the Middle East who criticize past U.S. interventions. However, others expressed concerns about the potential impact on human rights and the U.S.'s role in the region. Trump's visit focused on business deals and diplomatic efforts, including urging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and meeting with the new leader of Syria. The speech was seen by some as a reflection of prioritizing American interests over human rights concerns.</p>
