          <p>OpenAI has entered into a significant, multi-year agreement to purchase AI chips from AMD, a move seen as a direct challenge to market leader Nvidia. The deal, which AMD expects to generate tens of billions in revenue, also gives OpenAI warrants that could lead to an ownership stake in the chipmaker. This partnership focuses on using AMD's chips for inference, the day-to-day running of AI models. While OpenAI also has a major deal with Nvidia, primarily for training models, this diversification highlights the immense and growing demand for computing power in the AI industry.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Frank Bisignano, the current Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA), to also serve as the CEO of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This newly created CEO position will see Bisignano overseeing all daily operations at the tax agency while continuing his leadership at the SSA. The Treasury Department stated that the two agencies share similar technological and customer service objectives, making Bisignano a natural fit for the dual role. The appointment follows a period of leadership instability at the IRS, with its most recent commissioner stepping down after just two months.</p>

The victory was anchored by a spectacular century from Tazmin Brits, who scored 101, her fifth one-day international hundred this year.

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly resumed processing student loan forgiveness for some borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. The program, which cancels remaining debt after 20-25 years of payments, had been paused since July while the Department of Education assessed the impact of recent court decisions blocking the SAVE plan. A trade group for loan servicers and consumer advocates have confirmed that eligible borrowers are now receiving notices of debt cancellation. However, advocates note that significant backlogs remain for other forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), affecting tens of thousands of borrowers.</p>

The deal consists of $300 million in cash and $555 million in Firefly stock and is expected to close by the end of the year. Firefly plans to integrate SciTec's software, which includes missile warning, tracking, and defense systems, into its launch and space services.

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative former Economic Security Minister, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, 64, must now work to regain public support by addressing inflation and navigating complex diplomatic challenges, including relations with the U.S. under President Trump. A staunch conservative, her political positions have already created tension with her party's long-time coalition partner, Komeito, which has expressed concerns over her revisionist views on wartime history and could potentially withdraw its support.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated that she is "not afraid" despite facing regular protests, death threats, and a recent assassination attempt on a colleague. Barrett explained that she has developed a mental discipline to remain emotionally detached from the protests and threats, viewing them in a businesslike manner rather than allowing them to affect her. She attributes this outlook to her analytical approach to life and the law, which she details in her new book. Barrett emphasized that the court must take a long-term view of the presidency, not the president, when deciding cases.</p>

          <p>A recent decline in mortgage rates has made home loans more affordable, with the average 30-year fixed rate now at 6.34%, down from nearly 7% at the start of the year. For a $550,000 mortgage, this rate drop translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of $3,418.70, which is over $214 less per month compared to January's rates. Similarly, 15-year mortgage rates have also decreased, offering savings of around $148 per month on the same loan amount. These lower rates provide significant savings for new buyers and also create a potential opportunity for existing homeowners to reduce their monthly payments through refinancing.</p>

          <p>Doan's Bakery in Los Angeles has issued a recall for its White Chocolate Coconut cake, a dessert made famous by actor Tom Cruise who gifts it to friends during the holidays. The recall, which also includes the bakery's Carrot Bundt cake, was initiated because the products may contain undeclared wheat and milk, posing a risk to individuals with those allergies. According to the FDA, the labeling error was discovered during a routine inspection. The cakes were sold nationwide through the Goldbelly website, and the bakery has since updated its labels, with no illnesses reported to date.</p>
