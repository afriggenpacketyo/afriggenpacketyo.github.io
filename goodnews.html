          <p>European Union leaders met with Chinese officials in Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, even as relations are strained by significant disagreements. The EU has raised concerns over unfair market access, Chinese industrial subsidies, and its control over rare earth minerals. Despite these frictions and President Xi Jinping's absence from the initial summit plans, both sides are engaging in talks described by Brussels as a chance for frank discussion. Beijing, contending with an aggressive U.S. trade strategy, has positioned the relationship at a pivotal juncture, emphasizing partnership over rivalry.</p>

          <h2>Rare Violet Sea Snail Discovery on Southern California Beach Sparks Questions About Ocean Warming</h2>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, was discovered on a La Jolla Shores beach, a species not typically seen in the area for a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, usually inhabit warmer subtropical waters. An oceanography student from Scripps Institute of Oceanography found the specimens on a day when ocean temperatures were notably high. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers suggest the sighting could be an indicator of warming offshore waters and are encouraging the public to report any further discoveries.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, fueled by soaring demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in artificial intelligence. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its operating profit jump nearly 69% year-on-year. This success has positioned SK Hynix to challenge Samsung's dominance in the memory market, particularly in the HBM sector. The company anticipates continued strong demand and plans to double its HBM sales for the year compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The iconic Mexican band Los Bukis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, 52 years after their formation. During the ceremony, frontman Marco Antonio Solís dedicated the honor to the immigrant community in the United States, particularly those facing adversity. He referred to them as a "silent service force" that contributes immensely to the country. The event, which featured speeches from actor Demián Bichir and comedian Gabriel Iglesias, celebrated the group's profound impact on Latin music and culture, with Solís becoming the only Hispanic artist to have two separate stars on the legendary walkway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. This decision marks the first time an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of the policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. The White House stated it disagrees with the ruling and intends to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission following the game. After a period with the Boston Red Sox where he was positioned exclusively as a designated hitter, Devers stated he prefers playing a defensive role on the field. He explained that being active on defense helps keep his mind off his next at-bat, preventing him from overthinking his performance at the plate. This contrasts with his previous apparent reluctance to play a position other than DH while with the Red Sox, where a potential move to first base was reportedly shut down.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the first, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after the previous quarter's contraction. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This export surge was partly fueled by firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a slight rebound, analysts remain cautious, suggesting the pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained amid global trade uncertainties and a slowing domestic investment climate.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, a strategic move analysts believe is designed to indirectly counter China's influence. Under the deals, imports from the two Southeast Asian nations will face a 19% tariff, while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. The policy aims to reshape regional supply chains and provide access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. However, some experts note that Chinese companies are already a step ahead, having increasingly localized their production within these countries, making them less reliant on simple transshipments.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market is still favoring sellers, there are early signs of a shift that may provide some relief for homebuyers. According to real estate company Redfin, the number of sellers nationally exceeded buyers in May at the highest rate since 2013, indicating rising inventory. However, home prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. Experts advise prospective buyers to consider homes that have been on the market longer or to look for properties that need work in desirable neighborhoods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a crucial extra-time winner against Germany to send her team to the Euro 2025 final against England. Her heroic moment comes after a challenging start to the tournament, as she was discharged from a hospital just days before it began after suffering from viral meningitis. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner was eased back into the lineup but demonstrated her world-class talent when it mattered most. Her skillful goal broke a tense deadlock, capping a remarkable personal journey and sending Spain to its first-ever Women's European Championship final.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched two identical TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to better understand and predict "space weather," phenomena that can disrupt GPS, communications satellites, and terrestrial power grids. The twin satellites will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for various missions, including testing new multi-protocol space communications and measuring Earth's energy balance.</p>
