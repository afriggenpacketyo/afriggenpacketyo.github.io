          <p>A 36-year-old California woman participating in a YouTube survival challenge became lost in Michigan's Pigeon River State Forest. After being reported missing, she was located by a Michigan State Police helicopter using its advanced camera system. The search initially involved state troopers and canine units on the ground before the aerial crew spotted her. She was then safely escorted out of the dense forest by law enforcement and firefighters, bringing the ordeal to a positive conclusion.</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his desire for the team to incorporate long throw-ins and long balls into their strategy for the upcoming World Cup. Despite the team's current success in qualifying with a short-passing style, Tuchel believes these direct tactics will be crucial for success on the world stage. He acknowledged the limited training time but emphasized that such patterns, along with crosses, are making a comeback and will be important in the tournament. Tuchel's contract is set to conclude after the World Cup.</p>

He was on the call for the game between the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers, where his brother T.J. Watt plays.

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, asserted that the central bank's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence." Speaking on CBS's "Face the Nation," Hassett warned that historical examples show political control over central banks is a "recipe for inflation and misery." His comments come amid President Trump's public pressure on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates and concerns about White House influence over the historically independent institution.</p>

This win marks her fourth Grand Slam title and continues an impressive streak of reaching at least the semi-finals in 11 of her last 12 major tournaments.

          <p>The Oasis reunion tour, making a stop at the Rose Bowl, has been characterized by powerful emotional outpourings from the audience, drawing comparisons to the communal experience of Taylor Swift's Eras tour. The concert review highlights how the band's performance, featuring brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, has become a nightly ritual of catharsis for tens of thousands of fans singing along to classic hits. Despite the brothers' famously contentious history, the show focused on the music's unifying power, with the band sounding sharp and Liam's vocals remaining strong. The event underscored a modern desire for real-world connection through shared musical experiences.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a controversial team order from McLaren. Lando Norris, who had been running ahead of his teammate Oscar Piastri, fell behind him after a slow pit stop caused by a team error. Despite the issue being the team's fault, McLaren instructed Piastri to let Norris pass to reclaim second place, a decision Piastri questioned but ultimately followed. The incident highlights the team's commitment to its "racing principles" of fairness, even as it navigates a tense intra-team title fight.</p>

          <p>Mercedes-Benz has demonstrated a significant advancement in electric vehicle technology with its AMG GT XX concept, which achieved a charging speed of over 1 megawatt from a single cable. This breakthrough, made possible by in-house developed axial flux motors and a direct-cooled battery, allowed the vehicle to gain the equivalent of over 55 miles of range in just one minute. The technology is not merely experimental and is expected to be integrated into the production version of the car next year. The development brings EV charging times closer to the speed of refueling a conventional gasoline-powered car.</p>

Known for his profane language, rumpled appearance, and fierce advocacy for the underprivileged, Burton served as Senate president pro tem and later chaired the California Democratic Party. After overcoming a cocaine addiction that derailed his career in the 1980s, he returned to public service and founded a nonprofit to support foster youth.</p>

In response, a hostile new-ball spell from Jofra Archer decimated the South African batting lineup, which collapsed to 72-9 before the match concluded. The win serves as a morale boost for England, despite having already lost the series.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of government data shows that Massachusetts residents spend more per capita on lottery tickets than any other state, averaging $915 annually. Rhode Island follows at $573 per person, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50 a year. The report suggests that accessibility may play a role, as urban areas offer more opportunities to purchase tickets. Lottery sales represent a significant source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of general funds and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota.

The driver, who was still in his racing suit and helmet, initially resisted but was taken into custody.
