        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly expands, Hong Kong organizations are encouraged to proactively implement secure AI practices to mitigate potential risks. Organizations must address security risks, especially those related to personal data privacy. International declarations such as the Bletchley Declaration and UN resolutions emphasize the need for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. China's Global AI Governance Initiative promotes a people-centered approach to AI development, stressing both development and security. Hong Kong businesses should proactively implement AI security measures to protect data and ensure responsible use of the technology.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to halt its bonus scheme for senior executives following criticism that it was inappropriate given the company's financial struggles and environmental performance. The proposed "retention scheme" could have paid executives up to 50% of their salaries on top of regular bonuses. The decision follows pressure from Downing Street and the environment secretary, who accused Thames Water of trying to circumvent forthcoming rules against water company bonuses. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper's recent performance at the Madrid Open, where he reached the final, has highlighted the potential of British players on clay courts. Historically, the French Open has not been a tournament where British singles players have had much success, with Sue Barker being the last British singles champion in 1976. Last year, all six Britons in the singles competition were eliminated in the first round. Despite these historical challenges, there is optimism about the current crop of British players and their ability to perform well on clay.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has been bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to a universal antivenom. Friede has gradually built up an immunity to multiple types of venom, which has led researchers to study his blood. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions of people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers hope to synthesize a treatment from Friede's blood that could be used for multiple different kinds of venomous snake bites, offering a more effective and accessible solution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism by some in the Maga movement, who view him as a globalist. However, the new pope's choice of name signals a challenge to right-wing populism, reminiscent of Leo XIII's confrontation with the economic injustices of the Industrial Revolution. Leo XIV aims to address modern crises such as wars, climate change, and inequality, which contrasts with the insular and nationalistic Maga worldview. His approach may challenge Catholic Maga figures who have aligned their faith with Trumpian nationalism.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning without worrying about costs. The supplementary budget bill includes 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs. The initiative aims to protect residents' lives and daily living amid predictions of an extremely hot summer and declining real wages. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit from the plan, saving approximately 5,000 yen over the four months.</p>

          <p>The article explains the fundamental legal principle of habeas corpus, a right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution that protects individuals from unlawful detention. It details how habeas corpus ensures that the government provides a valid legal reason for detaining someone and allows individuals to challenge their detention in court. The article also discusses the historical origins of habeas corpus, its limited suspension in U.S. history, and the Trump administration's recent consideration of suspending it for detained migrants.

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with nine strikeouts, as the Dodgers secured a dramatic 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite Yamamoto's brilliance, closer Tanner Scott blew a one-run lead in the ninth and allowed a two-run homer in the tenth. However, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the tenth, scoring three runs to snap a four-game losing streak. The win was particularly crucial given the team's recent struggles and Yamamoto's outstanding outing.</p>
