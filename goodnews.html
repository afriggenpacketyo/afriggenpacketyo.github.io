        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While some Afrikaners are taking up President Trump's offer to resettle in the US due to concerns about crime and land policies, many others are choosing to stay in South Africa and contribute to the country's future. The US offer came after claims of a 'genocide' against white Afrikaners, a claim widely discredited, even though farm attacks do occur in a country with a high murder rate affecting all citizens. Some who are leaving cite land invasions and a lack of government support, while those staying express pride in their Afrikaner origins and a commitment to building a better future for all South Africans. The US embassy clarified that applicants need to be of South African nationality, Afrikaner or from a racial minority, and able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, while relatives of the Menendez brothers expressed joy and hope for their release. The state parole board will conduct hearings in June before sending final reports to the governor, who will determine whether the brothers should receive clemency.</p>

          <p>Residents in a Richmond, California neighborhood are puzzled by a series of dead birds found under power lines, prompting an investigation by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. While some residents suspect electrocution, officials say the birds show signs of trauma, possibly caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. PG&E has stated that their equipment is compliant with avian safe guidance and that the birds were not electrocuted. The investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the bird deaths.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines, reversing a previous ban enacted after concerns over a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, backed by Abu Dhabi's ruling family. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that the changes aim to protect media plurality while enabling publishers to secure essential funding. The decision follows consultations indicating that a complete ban was too restrictive for financing, with ministers determining that a 15% threshold for State Owned Investors was the most effective approach.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas by easing the permitting process. Newsom also plans to include provisions in his revised state budget that would reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other obstacles to new housing construction. The governor praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and State Senator Scott Wiener for sponsoring the bills, which are designed to accelerate urban infill and exempt them from CEQA, focusing on judicial streamlining to address the state's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant drop last year, marking the most substantial progress in over a decade, yet this positive trend coincides with proposed funding cuts to crucial federal health programs. Data from the CDC reveals a nearly 27% decrease in drug fatalities nationwide, with declines observed across major drug categories and in most states. While experts attribute this progress to factors such as changes in the illicit drug supply and increased access to treatment, concerns linger about the sustainability of these gains in light of potential budget reductions affecting addiction-related initiatives.</p>

While those already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not be affected, new applications will be frozen, and starting in 2027, adults with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' will be required to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom attributed the budget shortfall to President Trump's tariff policies and the higher-than-expected cost of the health care expansion.</p>
