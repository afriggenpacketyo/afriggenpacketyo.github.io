          <p>Japan and the United States are reportedly planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven (G7) leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June. Prior to this, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for another round of ministerial-level negotiations regarding Trump's tariff policies. Japan aims to persuade the U.S. to remove tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, including a 10 percent baseline levy and a 14 percent country-specific portion. Despite previous negotiation failures, both countries are working towards reaching a deal as quickly as possible. The focus is on boosting investment and creating jobs in the U.S., while Trump aims to reduce the trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to a serious health risk. 19,203 cases of 12-ounce cans labeled as ‚Äúzero sugar‚Äù actually contained the full amount of sugar, around 39 grams. The mislabeling poses a risk to individuals needing to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, and the affected cans were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina with a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date of February 16, 2026. Customers who purchased the affected cans are advised to return them for a full refund or discard them. This occurred after Coca-Cola recalled Topo Chico Mineral Water due to possible bacterial contamination.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address rising prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests will be sold through direct contracts with retailers. The 2020 rice is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms, and this move aims to supply smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops. The release will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the ministry suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of further price increases.</p>

Additionally, several papers focus on Labour's pledge to invest ¬£14 billion in the Sizewell C nuclear plant, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create jobs. The move is seen as an attempt to overshadow the controversy surrounding the winter fuel payment decision, and some sources are saying this will lead to an embarassing u-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits.</p>

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have plummeted, with a 47% reduction in risk for those aged 20 to 29. Provisional CDC data indicates that fatal overdoses among those under 35 decreased from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. However, some groups, like those born between 2005 and 2011, have seen a slight increase in deaths, and concerns remain about potential funding cuts to addiction services.</p>
