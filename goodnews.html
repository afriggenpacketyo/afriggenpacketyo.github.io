          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument dedicated to an individual African American at the location, which is currently surrounded by statues of White men, many with Confederate ties. The bipartisan initiative aims to provide a more complete narrative of the state's history. Sculptor Basil Watson is creating the 12-foot statue, which will symbolize Smalls' courageous journey from slavery to statesmanship.</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project long desired by President Trump. The estimated $200 million cost will be covered by private donations, including from the president himself, with construction slated to begin in September. The new facility, to be built alongside a modernized East Wing, will have a seating capacity of 650, eliminating the need for temporary tents for large events like state dinners. Officials state the design will honor the White House's historical architecture while providing a much-needed modern event space.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase socio-economic diversity, the UK government will restrict its main civil service internship program to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route, as the government seeks to create a workforce that better understands the populace.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook stated the company will significantly increase its investment in artificial intelligence and is "very open" to acquisitions of any size to accelerate its AI roadmap. This comes as Apple faces pressure to match the massive AI spending of its tech rivals. During an earnings call, Cook confirmed Apple has already acquired around seven smaller companies this year and is reallocating internal staff to focus on AI features. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than competitors, officials noted a hybrid model that includes partnerships for accessing necessary systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a notably quiet trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by their National League rivals. The team addressed its needs by acquiring veteran reliever Brock Stewart from the Minnesota Twins and outfielder Alex Call from the Washington Nationals. The front office signaled its faith in the current roster, betting on internal improvement and the return of injured players to fuel a late-season push. This conservative approach contrasts with aggressive moves by competitors like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic downtown Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure by 45 days following an overwhelming surge in customers. Since announcing it would shut down, the establishment has seen hours-long lines of patrons seeking a final meal. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, providing temporary relief for the staff. While grateful for the community support, Moses stated the business model remains challenging due to high costs and post-pandemic demand issues, and he is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy.</p>

          <p>China's on-demand delivery war is intensifying as major players Meituan and JD.com invest heavily in central kitchen infrastructure. Meituan plans to launch 1,200 "Raccoon Restaurants," which are takeaway-only food court hubs designed to lower costs and boost efficiency for its restaurant partners. In response, e-commerce giant JD.com announced a 1 billion yuan investment to establish 10,000 of its own self-operated kitchens over the next three years. These strategic moves signal a new phase of competition focused on controlling the food production and delivery supply chain.</p>

The successful debut comes after Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed due to regulatory pressure. This event marks a bright spot in the tech IPO market, which has been subdued for several years, signaling renewed investor appetite. (not investment advice)</p>
