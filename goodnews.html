          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent figure in France's women's rights movement, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her case, which resulted in the conviction of 51 men, sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in a legal reform that now includes a lack of consent in the country's criminal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt against him during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He attributed his survival to divine intervention and praised the heroic actions of first responders and rally attendees who assisted the wounded. The statement also honored Corey Comperatore, a rallygoer who was killed while protecting his family. The incident continues to raise questions about Secret Service security protocols, which have since been under review.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year-over-year. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has been loosening monetary policy amid these global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated that the institution is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to slow. In an interview, Bailey stated his belief that the path for rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This follows two previous rate cuts and a recent hold at 4.25%. The comments come as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, putting pressure on the government to stimulate growth.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, a move that aligns with their strategy of fast-tracking college talent to the major leagues. The choice is particularly poignant for Bremner, whose mother recently passed away from breast cancer, and he noted the emotional significance of being drafted by the "Angels." Bremner demonstrated remarkable resilience by continuing to pitch at a high level during his mother's illness. The Angels are hopeful that his powerful fastball and changeup will make him a key part of their future starting rotation.</p>

It highlights two specific examples, Invitation Homes and Realty Income, detailing their business models of owning vast portfolios of single-family and commercial properties, respectively. The piece explains how these companies provide investors with regular dividend income derived from rental cash flow. It contrasts this with the hands-on management and higher initial investment required for traditional rental properties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that today's younger, more experienced travelers are less interested in traditional sightseeing and more focused on seeking unique, authentic experiences that allow for interaction with local communities. This shift is part of a broader trend he calls "rainbow tourism," with travelers from a more diverse range of countries exploring the globe. A recent McKinsey study supports this, finding Gen Z travelers are significantly more willing to spend on travel experiences than baby boomers.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is marking a major meteorological milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken sequence of handwritten data is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, predating even the modern naming system for clouds. The records, which are still maintained by a human observer today, provide an invaluable history of the region's climate. The observatory's work also led to key scientific developments, such as the invention of the four-cup anemometer for accurately measuring wind speed in the 19th century.</p>

Despite struggles from some veteran players and an injury-plagued pitching staff, the team has maintained the top record in the National League. Freddie Freeman drove in the go-ahead run in the 11th inning to clinch the win.</p>
