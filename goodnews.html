          <p>The United Kingdom has announced a new defense strategy prioritizing NATO and addressing threats from Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China. The plan includes significant investments in submarines, weapons manufacturing, AI, and nuclear deterrence, aiming for "war-fighting readiness." This "NATO first" policy will focus on immediate threats to Europe but also addresses Indo-Pacific security through the AUKUS partnership. The U.K. aims to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 and take a leadership role within NATO, particularly given questions about U.S. reliability.</p>
