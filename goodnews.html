          <p>Older film and television actors are demonstrating enduring star power, challenging ageist perceptions in the entertainment industry, as highlighted by the UN International Day of Older Persons. Recent hits like Netflix's "The Thursday Murder Club" and Hulu's "Only Murders in the Building" showcase veteran talents such as Helen Mirren, Ben Kingsley, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. These actors, many in their 70s and 80s, continue to lead popular productions, earning critical acclaim and high viewership. Their continued success underscores the value of experience, wisdom, and comedic timing, proving that age is not a barrier to captivating audiences and driving box office or streaming charts.</p>

          <p>Timor-Leste is poised to become the 11th member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in October, concluding a 14-year application process. This membership is expected to bring significant benefits, including enhanced regional inclusion and economic integration for the young nation, which gained independence in 2002. Despite recent protests over government spending on luxury vehicles, Timor-Leste's democratic credentials were lauded after the government reversed its decision. While some skepticism exists within the Timorese society regarding immediate benefits, the accession is seen as a crucial step for the resource-dependent country to secure its economic and political sovereignty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is set to announce an agreement with Pfizer aimed at voluntarily lowering medication prices within Medicaid, aligning with his administration's push to link U.S. drug costs to cheaper international rates. The deal reportedly includes discounted prices in Medicaid and a three-year reprieve on planned pharmaceutical tariffs, provided Pfizer builds manufacturing plants in the U.S. This initiative comes as drugmakers face a presidential deadline to address high drug prices and amid the revival of the "most favored nation" policy. The agreement, which saw Pfizer's shares rise, represents a significant move in the ongoing effort to control pharmaceutical expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is stepping down from his role to become executive chairman, effective January 1, 2026, causing a slight dip in company shares. Ek, who co-founded the streaming giant in 2006, will be succeeded by current co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, who will serve as co-CEOs. He stated this transition formalizes existing operational structures, where he has increasingly delegated day-to-day management. In his new capacity, Ek plans to focus on Spotify's long-term strategy and provide support to the senior leadership team, marking a significant leadership restructuring for the company after nearly two decades under his direct guidance.

Social Security is classified as mandatory spending, meaning its funding has already been approved by Congress indefinitely. However, a shutdown could disrupt other Social Security Administration services, such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacement Medicare cards. The SSA's contingency plan indicates that approximately 90% of its workforce would remain on the job, albeit some without pay, to ensure critical direct-service operations and timely benefit payments continue during any lapse in appropriations.</p>

          <p>Jamie Siminoff, Ring's founder, has returned to lead the Amazon-owned video doorbell company, reaffirming its original mission to "make neighborhoods safer" with enhanced AI technology. Siminoff, who previously stepped down, was motivated by a personal encounter with violence to focus on increasing camera density and leveraging AI, like the new "Search Party" feature for lost pets, with potential future crime applications. While Ring's collaborations with police have faced criticism regarding privacy and racial profiling, Siminoff maintains the company facilitates privacy-centric footage requests for law enforcement. This move signals a renewed focus on security and public safety, despite ongoing debates about surveillance and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Milorad Dodik, the long-serving leader of Republika Srpska, has withdrawn from all official roles in the Serb-majority entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina after nearly three decades in power. This capitulation follows a months-long standoff with the state judiciary, which sentenced him to a year in prison and barred him from politics for six years for flouting decisions by the international High Representative. Despite initial defiance and threats of secession, Dodik's party, SNSD, ultimately conceded, and he has requested an interim president be appointed. His departure marks a significant shift in Bosnian politics, highlighting the impact of international oversight and internal political fragmentation on his legacy.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian (also known as Yadi Zhang), has been convicted in the UK following an international fraud investigation that led to the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure: 61,000 bitcoin, valued at over £5 billion. Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency, which was stolen from over 128,000 victims in a large-scale scam in China between 2014 and 2017. She had fled to the UK using false documents, attempting to launder the funds through property purchases. This conviction, the culmination of a seven-year probe, underscores global efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related money laundering and bring fraudsters to justice.</p>

          <p>Rob Key, England's managing director of cricket, has cautioned players to "be smart and not get caught doing stupid things" during the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, known for its intense scrutiny and hostile environment. Recalling past incidents, like Jonny Bairstow's alleged "headbutting" and Ben Duckett pouring a drink on James Anderson in 2017-18, Key emphasized the need for players to be aware of their public profile. The highly anticipated Ashes series, following a 2-2 draw in the UK, begins on November 21, with England aiming for their first win in Australia in 14 years.
