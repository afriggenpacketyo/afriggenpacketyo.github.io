          <p>President Trump's Middle East tour presents a strategic opportunity for renewed relations with Syria, potentially involving the lifting of sanctions. Syria's new government, led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, is seeking cooperation with the U.S. and is demonstrating a willingness to cooperate on intelligence issues and business. However, some officials urge caution, noting al-Sharaa's authoritarian background and the government's limited control within Syria. Despite these challenges, there is optimism about establishing a strategic relationship between the U.S. and Syria, focusing on mutual interests and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Amidst President Trump's changing tariff policies, consumers can save money by looking for sales, checking product origins, and purchasing domestic goods. Sales events like Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day offer opportunities for discounts. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) exempts many goods traded between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from tariffs if they meet origin requirements. Electronics and toys are expected to be most affected by tariffs, so consumers should consider purchasing these items sooner rather than later, without panicking.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to reshore manufacturing jobs in the U.S., manufacturers report difficulty filling open positions, with nearly half a million jobs currently available. This is due to a tight labor market and a skills gap, as many positions require specialized knowledge or college degrees. While manufacturers have increased pay, the issue is complex, requiring a focus on productivity, vocational training, and apprenticeships to build a capable workforce. Apprenticeship programs such as The Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME) offer promising pathways to skilled manufacturing careers.</p>
