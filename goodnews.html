          <p>Columbia University will pay $200 million and submit to federal monitoring to resolve claims of discriminating against Jewish students. The settlement, made with the Trump administration, restores access to federal grants that were at risk. While the university does not admit wrongdoing, it has acknowledged that Jewish students and faculty faced unacceptable incidents and that reforms are necessary. This agreement follows a period of intense campus protests and scrutiny over the university's handling of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to strong global demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in AI systems for clients like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence in sustained demand for the remainder of 2025, solidifying its leadership position over rivals in the competitive HBM market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift that may slightly favor buyers, although it remains predominantly a seller's market. An increase in housing inventory, with sellers outnumbering buyers at the highest rate since 2013, is contributing to this change. However, record-high median sale prices, driven by homeowners with low-rate mortgages staying put, continue to create challenges for prospective buyers. Experts advise that opportunities may lie in properties that have been on the market longer or require renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. Prompted by a campaign led by the island nation of Vanuatu, the court affirmed that existing international laws and treaties compel nations to act and provide reparations for climate-related damages. While not legally binding, this unanimous opinion sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence climate litigation and international policy negotiations worldwide, strengthening the position of nations vulnerable to climate change.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, which will study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This research aims to improve understanding and prediction of "space weather," phenomena that can disrupt GPS, communication satellites, and power grids. The identical spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The mission is critical for protecting both space-based assets and terrestrial infrastructure from solar-induced disturbances.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, surpassing expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession. The growth was driven by a rebound in total consumption and strong exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This positive economic data comes as the country faces potential trade challenges, including a 25% U.S. tariff on its exports if a new trade deal is not reached. The Bank of Korea has held interest rates steady, balancing low growth forecasts with financial stability concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
