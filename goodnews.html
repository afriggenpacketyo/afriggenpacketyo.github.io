          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has entered into an agreement to offer U.S. federal agencies as much as $1 billion in discounts for cloud services through 2028. The deal, announced by the General Services Administration (GSA), is designed to accelerate the government's migration to the cloud and adoption of artificial intelligence tools. The discounts cover a range of offerings, including cloud infrastructure credits, modernization programs, and training services. This arrangement follows a similar agreement the GSA made with Oracle and another with OpenAI, signaling a broad public-private push to enhance the nation's technological capabilities.</p>

This pact marks the first-ever direct agreement between the two heads of state, aimed at resolving decades of conflict, most recently centered on the Nagorno-Karabakh region. As part of the deal, Armenia plans to announce U.S. development rights for a transit corridor named the "Trump Route," enhancing its access to the West.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight in a 72-week, late-stage trial. While the results pave the way for the drug's market entry, they fell slightly below some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's shares to drop. In contrast, shares of rival Novo Nordisk, which makes the injectable Wegovy, rose. Despite being less effective than injections, doctors see the pill as a promising and more accessible alternative for patients hesitant about needles, potentially transforming obesity care if it becomes widely available.

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller being named the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi. Waller's odds surged following reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with his policy views and that he has met with the president's team. A Trump nominee from 2020, Waller recently dissented on the Fed's decision to hold rates, arguing the approach was overly cautious. He has now overtaken previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, as investors and speculators wager on who will lead U.S. monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, as a relief strategy. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, with the remainder being forgiven. On average, consumers can reduce their balances by 30% to 50% before fees, though results vary based on financial hardship and negotiation. While this approach can provide significant savings and a faster path to being debt-free, it can also negatively impact credit scores and may have tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a new executive order to broaden the availability of cryptocurrency in retirement plans, investors have more ways to gain exposure, with crypto ETFs being a prominent option. ETFs offer a convenient way to invest in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly holding the currency, similar to how gold ETFs work. The market has seen record inflows into crypto ETFs this year, led by products like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. While these funds provide accessibility, investors are cautioned to distinguish between standard and high-risk leveraged ETFs, which are designed for short-term trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has successfully executed a $2.6 billion convertible note offering, attracting institutional buyers with zero-coupon bonds due in 2029 and 2032. These notes are convertible into equity at a significant premium to the current stock price, allowing Coinbase to raise capital without immediate interest payments or shareholder dilution. The company is using a portion of the proceeds to fund capped call transactions, which further hedge against dilution if the stock price soars. This strategic capital raise provides Coinbase with substantial flexibility for acquisitions, buybacks, or other corporate purposes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay posits that the decline of politeness, particularly in online interactions, is detrimental to personal well-being and a sign of cultural decay. The author argues that being rude, even to AI bots, can increase one's own anger and depression, while practicing courtesy elevates happiness. The piece suggests that individuals can protect their well-being by consciously making courtesy a habit in all interactions, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity rather than retaliation. In an era of widespread incivility, choosing politeness is presented as a powerful, countercultural act of personal freedom.</p>
