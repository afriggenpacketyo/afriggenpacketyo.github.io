          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school. The decision lets a lower court's injunction stand while the legal challenge against a state policy proceeds. The state's rule prohibits transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity. While not a ruling on the merits of the case, the court's order is a temporary victory for transgender rights advocates, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissenting from the decision.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie, starring Meryl Streep as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly, a "fair shot" that had wit and humor. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, admitting she was initially concerned the character would be a caricature but was impressed by Streep's fantastic performance. Her comments come as a sequel to the film is in production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) may be hesitant to renew them. However, this article advises that renewing could be a prudent financial move. Current CD rates remain competitive, often significantly higher than traditional savings accounts, and may have already priced in the anticipated Fed action. Locking in a high rate now can protect savings from the decline in returns that will affect variable-rate accounts if further rate cuts occur later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged by nearly 36% in a single day, its best performance since 1992, adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. The dramatic rise was fueled by the company's announcement of a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This growth is attributed to massive demand for its cloud infrastructure and AI services, positioning Oracle as a major competitor to Amazon and Microsoft. The stock rally also briefly made co-founder Larry Ellison the world's wealthiest person, showcasing the immense financial impact of the current AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for the first time in 19 months during a 54-minute "private tea" at Clarence House in London. The brief reunion is seen as a potential step toward reconciliation amid a long-standing estrangement within the royal family. The King traveled to London from Balmoral for cancer treatment, creating the opportunity for the meeting. While in the UK for charity commitments, Prince Harry did not meet with his brother, Prince William, with whom he remains estranged.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, dubbed Sapphire Canyon, was taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater. Analysis revealed mineral patterns and chemical compositions that, on Earth, are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While nonbiological explanations cannot be ruled out, researchers are excited about the prospect of bringing the sample to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

          <p>Shares of the Swedish "buy now, pay later" firm Klarna jumped 15% in their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $45.82. The company priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, above the expected range, raising $1.37 billion and achieving a valuation of about $17.3 billion. Klarna's successful debut signals strong investor appetite for high-profile tech listings and will test Wall Street's confidence in its expansion into banking services. The IPO generated significant returns for early investors like Sequoia Capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, calling it an "affront to the game." He argues the practice will price out ordinary fans and prioritize profit over the sport's accessibility, potentially leading to a 400% revenue increase compared to the Qatar World Cup. Mamdani's petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing and a cap on resale prices. The move aligns with his campaign's broader focus on affordability in the city.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal crash of an Air India flight in June, which killed 241 of the 242 people on board, the airline's CEO stated the carrier is embracing a "new normal" with an enhanced focus on safety. The preliminary investigation into the crash of the Boeing Dreamliner pointed to pilot confusion over fuel cutoff switches. While the full investigation is ongoing, the airline has conducted a "significant safety pause" to reinforce its procedures. The CEO affirmed this renewed safety culture is proceeding alongside the carrier's massive modernization and fleet expansion efforts.</p>

          <p>A weekend-long bus strike that was set to disrupt dozens of routes in London has been mostly called off after a pay offer was accepted. Unite union members employed by London United voted to accept the new deal, canceling their planned walkout. However, some industrial action may still proceed on a smaller number of routes operated by London Transit if further negotiations are unsuccessful. The resolution averts widespread travel chaos in the capital, which had already been experiencing disruptions from an ongoing London Underground strike.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, potentially ending a strike that began in early August. The five-year deal, which includes improved wages and a restored signing bonus, will be voted on by the more than 3,000 union members this Friday. The striking employees, based primarily in St. Louis, are responsible for assembling F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. The agreement marks a significant step toward resolving the first strike at the defense unit in nearly 30 years.</p>

          <p>As the mortgage market cools and the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, homeowners and buyers may be able to secure interest rates below 6%. This article outlines several strategies, including considering adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently average just under 6% for a 7/1 ARM. Diligently shopping around among different lenders can also yield significantly lower-than-average rates. Finally, strategically timing the market around Federal Reserve announcements could provide small windows of opportunity for locking in a more favorable rate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil in 2024, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report highlights the deep economic integration between the two nations, with bilateral commerce growing nearly fivefold over the past two decades. While this trade has generated a significant surplus for Brazil, the study also warns of the risks of over-reliance on a single partner. The majority of Brazil's exports to China are concentrated in just three commodities: soybeans, iron ore, and oil.</p>
