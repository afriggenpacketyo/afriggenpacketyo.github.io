          <p>Jewel Thais-Williams, the founder of the iconic Los Angeles nightclub Jewel’s Catch One, has passed away at the age of 86. For over four decades, her club served as a vital sanctuary for the Black LGBTQ+ community, welcoming patrons and performers like Ella Fitzgerald and Madonna when other venues were exclusionary. Beyond nightlife, Thais-Williams was a crucial activist during the AIDS crisis, co-founding the Minority AIDS Project and establishing one of the first housing facilities for women with HIV. Her legacy is celebrated for creating a space of safety, joy, and community that profoundly shaped L.A.'s cultural landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 20:08:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With forecasters predicting an unusually active 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, coastal homeowners are increasingly investing in climate-resilient construction. These homes feature designs like aerodynamic round shapes to reduce wind pressure, reinforced roof trusses, and specialized flood vents to protect the foundation from storm surges. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in building these structures, which are rated to withstand winds up to 190 mph and have a high success rate in past hurricanes. While costing more upfront, these resilient designs can lead to long-term savings, including significantly lower insurance premiums, making them a practical adaptation to the effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a two-hour meeting at the White House to discuss the war in Gaza and potential ceasefire negotiations. The meeting followed discussions between Netanyahu and other U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff indicated that Israel and Hamas are close to a deal, with only one major issue remaining for a 60-day ceasefire that would include a hostage exchange. While Trump expressed optimism about the talks, Qatar, a key mediator, has stated that more time is needed to reach a final agreement.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind power capacity, adding over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will install at least 9 GW this year, accounting for more than half of the global total, with an additional 22 GW already under construction. This surge is driven by strong government support and is a key component of President Xi Jinping's strategy to advance the nation's marine economy. The push is aimed at creating jobs, enhancing energy security, and boosting economic development in coastal provinces. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins promoting a weight-loss drug service has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ruling stated that it is illegal to advertise prescription-only medications to the public. In the ad for the brand Yazen, Collins claimed she had gone down two dress sizes thanks to its app and medication. The ASA determined that although a specific drug wasn't named, the post illegally promoted prescription weight-loss treatments. This was one of nine similar adverts from various companies that were banned in a recent crackdown by the regulatory body.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at U.S. airports, a policy that has been in place for over two decades. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change is effective immediately, citing dramatic evolution in security technology that makes the unpopular rule unnecessary. While shoes can now stay on, passengers must still remove belts, coats, and large electronics from their bags. The shoe removal rule was first implemented in 2006 after Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber," attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his footwear on a flight.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin to lead its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran in the field, currently directs the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new agency's approach. The new department, launching in January, was created to bring more accountability to the county's homelessness spending, which previously flowed through the much-criticized joint authority, LAHSA. Mahin will oversee a major reorganization, absorbing hundreds of staff and millions in funding to create a more integrated and effective system for addressing the region's homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's new forward, João Pedro, made a stunning first start for the club, scoring two goals in the Club World Cup semi-final against his former boyhood side, Fluminense. The Brazilian, who recently joined from Brighton for a significant fee, showcased his talent with two brilliant strikes that secured Chelsea's place in the final. His all-around performance, including strong link-up play and movement across the pitch, has immediately positioned him as a strong contender for a regular starting spot. The impressive debut suggests that Chelsea may have found a potent new solution to their ongoing search for a reliable central attacker.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a bullish outlook on the online used car retailer Carvana, recommending it as a long-term investment. He praised the company's convenient, all-in-one online platform for buying, selling, and financing cars, which he believes gives it an edge in the fragmented auto sales market. Cramer noted that Carvana is well-positioned to benefit from potential interest rate cuts and from new tariffs on foreign automakers that make used cars more attractive. Despite the stock's recent strong performance, he advised investors to start with a small position and wait for a pullback to buy more, acknowledging its history as a volatile stock.

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with a Peruvian port on the Pacific. The proposed 2,800-mile railway would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the port of Chancay, Peru, potentially shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days compared to routes using the Panama Canal. The project, with cost estimates exceeding $70 billion, is currently in the preliminary study phase, which is expected to assess its technical, environmental, and economic viability over the next five years.
