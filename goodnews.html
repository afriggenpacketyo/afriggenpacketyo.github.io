          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his spot in the French Open final for the second consecutive year after Lorenzo Musetti retired due to injury in the fourth set of their semi-final match. Alcaraz was leading 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 2-0 when Musetti, who had been aiming for his first major final, was forced to stop playing due to a thigh problem. Alcaraz expressed sympathy for Musetti's situation, stating that he never wants to win in that manner. The Spaniard will now face either Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner in the final, seeking to defend his title. This sets the stage for an exciting championship match.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street is experiencing a rebound following a previous downturn, largely driven by positive updates on the labor market. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2% and hourly wages increasing by 3.9% year-over-year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While there were downward revisions to previous months' reports, the market reacted favorably to the May data, signaling that the labor market had not collapsed as some feared. This is crucial for investor sentiment, as the U.S. economy relies heavily on private consumption. Sustained low unemployment and wage gains that outpace inflation suggest continued consumer spending power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital regulations that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures aim to enhance the stability of UBS and would also necessitate full capitalization of its foreign units, potentially reducing share buybacks. UBS shares initially jumped 6% following the announcement, ultimately closing 3.8% higher. While UBS supports most of the proposals, it disagrees with the extent of the capital requirements, estimating it would need around $42 billion in additional CET1 capital. The bank intends to engage in discussions with stakeholders to find reasonable solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices experienced a slight decrease in May after reaching a recent high in April, as consumers anticipating tariff-related price increases rushed to purchase vehicles. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index decreased by 1.5% from April to May, but remains 4% higher than the previous year. Retail prices have not decreased as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years. While tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly affect used car sales, they impact the used car market by influencing new vehicle prices and demand. Demand remains relatively strong due to low inventory levels, as consumers hold onto their vehicles longer and production has been limited. (not investment advice)</p>
