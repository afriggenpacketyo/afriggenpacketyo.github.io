        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue aggressive saving and frugal living to exit the workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents, like Nik and Adinah Johnson who retired in their forties, emphasize consuming less and investing wisely to achieve financial freedom. The core principle, popularized by books like "Your Money or Your Life," involves saving 25 times one's annual expenses to live off a 4% annual withdrawal. This lifestyle prioritizes personal freedom and time over material possessions, fundamentally changing one's relationship with money. (not investment advice)</p>

The tremor occurred Saturday night, marking the second seismic event in the state in less than two weeks. While no immediate damage was reported, officials have advised residents to be aware of potential aftershocks and inspect for any structural issues. This event follows a series of smaller quakes in Morris Plains and a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024, both linked to the active Ramapo Fault line in northern New Jersey.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the league's highest-paid players, recently stated that he does not know his exact net worth and prefers not to focus on it. Instead, Curry emphasizes creating a portfolio of investments and opportunities that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day financial management to his team. Financial planners suggest this is a healthy approach, as focusing on tangible goals and values-driven decisions can be more rewarding than fixating on a single number. Experts advise that understanding cash flow and setting meaningful personal milestones are more powerful indicators of financial well-being.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully developed a new cryogenic steel, CHSN01, designed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a nuclear fusion reactor.

The new steel can endure both the immense magnetic forces and the ultra-low temperatures near absolute zero required for the reactor's superconducting magnets to function. This breakthrough, detailed after a decade of research, places China in a leading position in the materials science field essential for future fusion energy.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has joined the ranks of tech billionaires following his company's successful IPO. A former Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University, Field co-founded Figma to create collaborative, web-based design tools, directly competing with industry giant Adobe. After a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles, Figma went public with a valuation soaring over $71 billion. Field's journey is marked by a focus on collaborative innovation and a humble leadership style, contrasting with many of Silicon Valley's more aggressive personalities.</p>

Now 84, Ardell reflects on his short time in the majors not with regret, but as a small part of a rich life defined by family, business, and philanthropy. His perspective shifted after marrying a baseball academic, which helped him appreciate his unique place in the sport's history.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but stoic on-course demeanor, is receiving praise for his comedic cameo in the new movie 'Happy Gilmore 2.' In the film, Scheffler plays a fun, self-effacing version of himself, even parodying his own real-life arrest earlier this year. This role offers a stark contrast to his robotic efficiency in tournaments, which can sometimes diminish viewing excitement. The appearance is seen as a positive image-enhancer for both Scheffler and the sport of golf, showing a more relatable and humorous side to the game's top player.</p>

          <p>While major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom are cutting their foreign aid budgets, countries such as Spain, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy are increasing their commitments. Spain has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, aiming to fill part of the void left by the dismantling of USAID. This shift could reshape global development, potentially leading to a more collaborative and less paternalistic model. These emerging donors, some of whom were once aid recipients themselves, are promoting a vision of 'solidarity' and partnership over the traditional top-down approach.</p>
