          <h2>New Tax Bill Includes Temporary Cuts Set to Expire Before Trump Leaves Office</h2>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a tax bill with almost all tax cuts, including increased child tax credits and standard deductions, set to expire at the end of 2028, just before President Trump's term concludes. This strategy aims to provide immediate financial benefits to Americans while avoiding long-term cost accounting. Some analysts warn that the temporary nature of the cuts could provide only a short-term economic boost, potentially offset by cuts to health care and food assistance. The bill also includes permanent measures, such as lower individual income rates and a tax break for business owners, continuing the architecture of the previous Republican tax cut. </p>

          <p>With inflation declining, interest rate cuts appearing likely, and home equity levels remaining high, now may be an opportune time for homeowners to consider a home equity line of credit (HELOC).

Carefully calculating potential payments under various interest rate scenarios is crucial for ensuring long-term financial stability.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are now closer to freedom after a judge reduced their sentences for the 1989 killings of their parents, making them immediately eligible for parole. The judge‚Äôs decision means they are immediately eligible for parole under California‚Äôs youthful offender law because of their young ages at the time of the murders. Their family and supporters celebrated the decision, which could bring an end to a case that has captured public attention for decades. A parole board will decide whether they should be released. </p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft, the White House said Wednesday. The deal for the 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines is Boeing's "largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order," according to the White House. It could also draw more scrutiny toward Trump's acceptance, and defense, of Qatar's offer to gift the U.S. a luxury 747 jet that will act as the new Air Force One. </p>
