          <p>U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a prominent liberal Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek re-election, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Citing a need for generational change within the Democratic party, the 78-year-old congressman reflected on his influential tenure, which included leading the House Judiciary Committee and spearheading impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump. Nadler, a long-time political rival of Trump dating back to Manhattan development projects in the 1980s, expressed confidence in the party's future and stated his intention to support a successor for his Upper West Side district, signaling a significant transition in New York politics.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly positive as investors monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit and processed news regarding U.S. tariffs. A recent U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's global tariffs illegal has introduced significant uncertainty into the economic landscape, influencing investor sentiment. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined, reflecting varied regional reactions to global economic signals and local data, such as South Korea's slowing inflation rate which marked its weakest rise since November.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability, is raising awareness about the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. Despite the Equalities Act being passed there 15 years ago, she points out numerous physical barriers, from heavy doors with round handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets. Tidball, who has given evidence to the House of Commons Modernisation Committee, argues that the building's inaccessibility deters disabled individuals from entering politics and does not reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities, calling for urgent changes to make the institution more inclusive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a landmark of American architecture and the prototype for national park lodges. Built in 1904 from approximately 10,000 trees, including uniquely twisted logs described as "freaks of the forest," it was once advertised as the largest log cabin in the world. The inn's rustic style, which has welcomed presidents and millions of visitors, set a benchmark that influenced the design of other famous lodges in parks like Yosemite and Glacier. Today, carpenters work meticulously to preserve its historic character while ensuring its structural integrity for future generations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an alert from lawyers about a hurried government plan to remove hundreds of children. The judge justified the extraordinary 14-day restraining order by noting the government's attempt to execute the plan during the "wee hours" of a holiday weekend, which attorneys argued would unlawfully bypass legal protections that allow these minors to seek humanitarian relief in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record during the summer transfer window, with the total outlay surpassing £3 billion for the first time. This figure, significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion, is more than the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The window was headlined by major deals like Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move to Liverpool, which alone pushed its club spending to a record £415 million. This financial dominance highlights the growing economic gap between the Premier League and other top European football leagues.</p>

          <p>Following a league title victory, Liverpool capitalized on its strong position by orchestrating a record-breaking £415 million summer transfer window, a stark contrast to previous, more conservative spending. This shift in policy was fueled by accumulated funds from a quiet previous summer, significant commercial growth, and over £200 million in player sales. The club strategically targeted top talent like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak to evolve the team's style under manager Arne Slot, though a planned deal for defender Marc Guehi collapsed at the last minute. The tragic death of forward Diogo Jota also necessitated unforeseen changes to the squad.</p>

Critics have praised his performance as a "revelation," noting his sincere and ego-less portrayal, which is a significant departure from his action-hero persona.

          <p>China is advancing a proposal to establish a development bank for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian nations including Russia and India. The initiative, confirmed at a recent summit, aims to insulate member countries from the risks associated with the US dollar-dominated global trade system and to accelerate key infrastructure projects within the bloc. Analysts suggest the move is a logical step to strengthen the economic and financial autonomy of the SCO, creating an alternative to Western-led financial institutions and deepening regional integration among member states.

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating, an international team of researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting age estimates. The fossil's features, distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans, strengthen the theory that it belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species believed to be a common ancestor. This finding reshapes our understanding of European prehistory, suggesting different human populations coexisted and overlapped in the region.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across much of the UK in the coming days due to heightened solar activity. A fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun means the lights could be seen much further south than usual, potentially reaching the Midlands. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the phenomenon could provide a rare and memorable display for sky-watchers. The best viewing opportunities are expected on Monday and Tuesday nights, with Northern Ireland and northeast Scotland having the highest probability of clear skies.</p>
