          <h2>FIFA Considers Expanding Club World Cup Amid Ambitions for Growth</h2>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA President Gianni Infantino's vision for a bigger, more frequent tournament appears to be gaining momentum despite initial criticism. The substantial prize money has convinced top clubs of the event's value, with some even proposing it be held every two years. FIFA is reportedly considering expanding the competition to 48 teams in 2029, aiming to involve more elite clubs and increase revenue. However, concerns from players' unions about welfare and a packed schedule remain a significant unresolved issue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to address contemporary issues. Pupils will be taught to recognize misogyny, understand the harms of AI-generated "deepfakes," and identify unhealthy attitudes regarding consent. The curriculum will also encourage identifying positive male role models to counter harmful online influences. While the government has dropped plans for strict age limits on topics, it will outline age-appropriate content for primary and secondary levels, with the new guidance coming into full effect by September 2026.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by offering discounts of up to £3,750. The grants will apply to eligible EV models costing up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million program aimed at accelerating the transition from petrol and diesel cars. This initiative comes as the country works towards its 2030 ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles. However, critics and industry figures note that a lack of public charging infrastructure remains a significant barrier to widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>This article explores the remarkable turnaround in world number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's performance, crediting his work with putting coach Phil Kenyon. Despite being the best player from tee to green, Scheffler's putting was a major weakness until he sought Kenyon's help in late 2023. By changing to a mallet-style putter and refining his technique, Scheffler's confidence and results surged, leading to a dominant season with multiple wins, including a second Masters title. The feature highlights the crucial, often overlooked, role of specialized coaching at the elite level of professional sports.</p>

          <p>Mainland China is poised to issue a record number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, driven by favorable regulations and strong investor appetite. In the first half of 2025 alone, 166 new ETFs were launched, putting the country on track to surpass its 2021 record of 277. This surge is fueled by government efforts to streamline approvals and reduce fees for fund managers. The growth reflects a wider global trend and indicates increasing investor interest in diversified, exchange-traded investment vehicles within the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly beating forecasts and keeping it on course to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, the growth slowed from the first quarter, and other indicators point to underlying weakness, including a slowdown in retail sales and a deepening slump in real estate investment. Despite the resilient headline number, concerns about deflationary pressures are mounting, fueling calls for more government stimulus and deeper structural reforms to support domestic consumption and stabilize the property market.

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales and up to 40% of all passenger cars in its capital, Oslo. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and concurrently high taxes on polluting vehicles. This approach, combined with heavy investment in public charging infrastructure, has effectively made electric cars the more logical and affordable choice for consumers, creating a blueprint for other nations.</p>

The first of these massive clusters, named Prometheus, is slated to come online in 2026 in Ohio. This colossal investment underscores Meta's commitment to leading the AI race, but also raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption required for such large-scale data operations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, which allow recipients to work legally and shield them from deportation, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan have improved. Immigrant advocacy groups sued, and the court's one-week stay provides a brief reprieve while it considers the case. The move highlights the ongoing legal and political battles over the administration's hardline immigration policies and the fate of Afghans who fled to the U.S.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that animals can react to ultrasonic sounds produced by plants, potentially revealing a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. A study from Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. This is the first evidence of an animal responding to plant-generated sounds. The findings open up a new field of study, suggesting that many animals might use these sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter.</p>
