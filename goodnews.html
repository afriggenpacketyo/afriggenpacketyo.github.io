          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK) declared it would lay down its arms after a four-decade-long insurgency against the Turkish state, a decision that could significantly impact regional dynamics. The announcement followed calls from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan for the group to disarm, as the PKK now believes the Kurdish issue can be solved through democratic politics. The group's decision could end a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and influence other Kurdish militias, particularly in Syria, potentially shifting regional dynamics beyond Turkey's borders. The Turkish government has publicly stated that no concessions were made to persuade the PKK to disarm.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced plans to disband its organizational structure and end its armed struggle against the Turkish government, marking a potential turning point after four decades of conflict. The group stated that it has brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, completing its historical mission. This announcement follows a call by PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan to lay down arms and comes as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted at the decision, expressing optimism for a terror-free Turkey. The PKK was founded in 1978 with the goal of achieving an independent Kurdish state, later seeking autonomy within Turkey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A widespread power outage affecting Spain, Portugal, and southern France has sparked a debate about the role of renewable energy sources in maintaining energy security. The blackout, which lasted several hours, disrupted daily life and prompted investigations into its cause, including the possibility of a cyberattack. While some observers have suggested that the high reliance on wind and solar power in Spain and Portugal may have contributed to the outage, Spanish authorities and grid operators maintain that renewable energy was not at fault. The incident has highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and ensuring grid stability as countries transition to cleaner energy systems.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a fintech app designed to support collaborative money-saving methods, also known as "money circles," within immigrant communities in the U.K. The app caters to traditional savings practices where groups pool funds together on a rotating basis, addressing the lack of understanding and discrimination faced by immigrant communities within mainstream financial systems. Bloom Money aims to provide a regulated and digital solution to this informal but reliable system, helping immigrant communities build wealth and overcome financial barriers. The app helps prevent scenarios of fraud, and is meant to formalize practices that might be misconstrued by mainstream banks.</p>

          <p>Many of Monday's papers are leading on the government's new plans to control the levels of migration into the UK. The Guardian says the prime minister is toughening rules in what it calls a "challenge to Reform [UK]", which inflicted losses on Labour in the recent local elections. It states that adults such as spouses, siblings, parents and grown-up children who accompany foreign workers to the UK will be expected to pass an English language test, while care homes will be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad.

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled the world‚Äôs most advanced ocean simulation system with a resolution of 1km (0.6 mile) ‚Äì an unprecedented benchmark. The feat defies technological restrictions imposed by US semiconductor export controls designed to hobble China‚Äôs supercomputing sector. The simulation system, named LICOMK++ and developed by teams from the Chinese Academy of Sciences‚Äô Institute of Atmospheric Physics and Computer Network Information Centre, has broken computational barriers to deliver unparalleled precision in modelling global ocean dynamics and climate patterns.</p>
