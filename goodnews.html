          <p>Fujifilm's new $3 billion biologics manufacturing plant in North Carolina illustrates the significant time and investment required for pharmaceutical companies to increase U.S.-based production. The facility, which has been in development for five years, is opening just as the Trump administration threatens tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing. However, the complexity and lengthy regulatory approval process, typically taking three to five years for a new plant, show that companies cannot quickly pivot their supply chains. Despite these challenges, companies like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are investing heavily in U.S. facilities, driven by both tariff concerns and favorable tax policies.</p>

While he assured fans he is under treatment and will be fine, the recovery timeline would not allow him to participate in the required training for the show.

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has returned to practice this week after being sidelined by a back injury, described by his coach as an aggravated disc. Speaking to the media, the 37-year-old veteran emphasized that he is taking a "day-to-day approach" to his recovery and did not commit to being ready for the team's season opener. Stafford noted that he has felt good during recent practices and has been able to do more than initially expected. Coach Sean McVay expressed confidence in his quarterback's progress, stating that Stafford has been getting better each day and looks like his usual self.</p>

          <h2>Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Report Ordering from Kids' Menus to Save Money and Reduce Portions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:32:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of U.S. adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed citing the practice. The primary motivations are to save money amid economic uncertainty and to consume smaller, more manageable portion sizes. This consumer behavior coincides with major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's reporting slower sales, particularly among lower-income customers. The appeal of kids' meals lies in their lower prices and simpler offerings, making them an attractive option for budget-conscious and health-aware adult diners looking for value when eating out.</p>

          <h2>Existing U.S. Home Sales Increased in July as Price Growth Slows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, defying expectations of a decline. This uptick in sales, which are recorded at closing, likely reflects contracts signed in previous months when mortgage rates were slightly lower. The inventory of homes for sale increased by nearly 16% from the previous year, reaching the highest level since May 2020. This greater supply is helping to moderate price increases, with the median home price seeing only a 0.2% annual gain, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point.

          <h2>Financial Advisors Highlight ETF Strategy Used by Wealthy Investors to Defer Capital Gains Taxes</h2>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 exchange is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated stocks. This method involves converting assets from a taxable account, like a separately managed account (SMA), into shares of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches. The investor avoids an immediate tax bill, only paying capital gains when they eventually sell the ETF shares. However, the strategy has strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, and it can limit an investor's flexibility once their assets are held within the specific ETF.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:19:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates having declined from recent highs and the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut, financial experts are advising homeowners with high-interest loans to prepare for a potential refinancing opportunity. Key preparatory steps include checking credit reports for errors, protecting credit scores by avoiding new debt, and estimating home equity levels. Homeowners should also begin gathering necessary documents such as proof of income, insurance, and existing mortgage statements. By completing these steps in advance, borrowers can move quickly to lock in a lower rate when market conditions are favorable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been handed a challenging draw at the U.S. Open as she seeks her first win at the tournament since her historic 2021 victory. Although she will face a qualifier in the first round, her path could include a second-round match against the 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova and a potential third-round clash with 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. Raducanu, now ranked No. 35, narrowly missed being seeded, but enters the tournament in strong form after a competitive hard-court season. The draw also sets up potential clashes for other top players, including a tough first-round opponent for Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, known as the Red Roses, is set to begin its Rugby World Cup campaign against the USA, carrying the immense weight of being the tournament favorite. Having won 57 of their last 58 matches and seven consecutive Six Nations titles, the team's dominance is unprecedented. Despite this record, coach John Mitchell remains cautious, recalling the team's narrow loss in the last World Cup final and emphasizing the need to focus on performance over outcome. The tournament, held in England, is expected to break attendance records and significantly elevate the profile of the women's game.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, high-level officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, U.S.-brokered talks in Paris, marking the first such meeting in 25 years. The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. Tensions have been high since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, with Israel conducting numerous strikes in Syria. The talks represent a potential pathway toward stabilizing the border region and could be a preliminary step toward future normalization, though observers believe that remains a long-term goal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and the European Union have detailed a new trade framework that will see the U.S. impose a 15% tariff on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and other products. In return, the E.U. has agreed to eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and offer preferential terms for certain U.S. agricultural and seafood products. This agreement solidifies a pact announced in July, averting President Trump's earlier threat of a much higher 30% tariff rate. The framework also includes significant commitments for E.U. investment in U.S. energy and military equipment, aiming to rebalance the transatlantic trade relationship.</p>
