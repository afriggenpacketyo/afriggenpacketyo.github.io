          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. Reflecting on her transition from club to international management, Hayes described the new role as being "like becoming a grandparent," where she enjoys focused time with players before returning them to their clubs. The former Chelsea manager, who led the US to an Olympic gold medal shortly after taking the position, noted that the change has allowed her to apply more strategic, long-term thinking. She expressed great satisfaction with her new role and the opportunity to work with a nation that has been significant in her professional development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025 alone, highlighting the sport's rapid financial growth, primarily concentrated in leagues in England and the United States. While rising fees indicate a healthier economic ecosystem, experts express concern that this trend is widening the financial gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete with the broadcast and sponsorship revenues of their English and American counterparts. This financial disparity risks creating a permanent elite tier, potentially leaving many clubs and leagues behind as the sport's commercialization accelerates.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed reaction following the start of the U.S. government shutdown, while spot gold prices reached a new record high. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 declined after the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey on business sentiment showed a slight dip in optimism among large manufacturers. Conversely, markets in South Korea and Taiwan saw gains, with chipmaker TSMC rising after Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4.5 trillion. The Reserve Bank of India held its interest rates steady, leading to a modest rise in Indian indices, while markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.

          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations. The decision to pause was made to allow the central bank to assess the economic impact of a significant rate cut made in June, especially given moderating inflation and potential growth deceleration due to global trade uncertainties. The RBI projects the economy will grow by 6.8% in fiscal year 2026 but noted that headwinds from U.S. tariffs could pose a challenge. This hold comes after the Indian government recently reduced goods and services taxes on several items to stimulate domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Slipper, the most-capped player in the history of Australia's national rugby team, the Wallabies, will retire from international competition following this weekend's test match against New Zealand. The 36-year-old prop recently earned his 150th cap for the team, a historic first for any Wallabies player. Throughout his distinguished career, Slipper represented Australia in four World Cups and served as the team's captain on 15 occasions. In his announcement, he described representing his country as the "single proudest achievement" of his career and a dream he has lived for nearly 16 years.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is upgrading its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) to a full stock market listing on a U.S. exchange, a move aimed at attracting a broader base of global investors and accessing deeper capital pools. While the decision has fueled speculation about major companies defecting from the London Stock Exchange (LSE), AstraZeneca has affirmed that its headquarters, primary listing, and tax residency will remain in the U.K. The move follows a trend of other major firms like BHP and Flutter shifting their primary listings away from London. This action could make it easier for AstraZeneca to fully switch to a New York listing in the future if frustrations with the UK's drug-pricing regime continue. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting this week, supermarkets and other large retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products deemed unhealthy. The new restrictions are a key part of the government's strategy to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. The policy, which had been delayed due to cost-of-living concerns, aims to discourage impulsive purchases of high-fat, high-sugar, and high-salt items. Public health advocates have welcomed the move as a long-overdue step, arguing that such promotions do not save consumers money and instead encourage over-consumption and contribute to health inequalities.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant infrastructure milestone, with its total network of subsea energy pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers (6,213 miles). This was marked by the completion of a new pipeline section in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expansion is a key part of China's strategy to bolster its energy security by accelerating the exploration and transportation of offshore resources. Looking ahead, the network is planned to surpass 13,000 kilometers by 2030 and is being designed with the capability to transport greener fuels like hydrogen and shale gas to support the nation's energy transition.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has focused on navigating the alliance's precarious relationship with the United States, particularly following Donald Trump's reelection. Tasked with keeping the U.S. committed to the alliance, Rutte has engaged in careful diplomacy, which some experts describe as effective flattery, to manage President Trump's skepticism about defense spending. He successfully lobbied member nations to increase their financial commitments, securing Trump's participation in the recent NATO summit in The Hague. While his approach has been credited with giving European allies much-needed time to bolster their own security, questions remain about the long-term durability of these diplomatic successes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of today, every General Practitioner (GP) practice in England is mandated to provide online services for booking appointments throughout the entire workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. This government initiative aims to end the "8am scramble," where patients overwhelm phone lines trying to secure an appointment. The new system will allow patients to request non-urgent appointments, describe symptoms, and ask for a call back online, freeing up phone lines for more urgent cases. Despite some initial concerns from the British Medical Association about potential risks, ministers have proceeded with the plan, framing it as a key step in modernizing the NHS and improving patient access.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series. The offense was explosive, matching a franchise playoff record with five home runs, including two each from stars Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance over seven innings, keeping the Reds' bats quiet for most of the night. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues resurfaced late in the game, as three relievers walked four batters and allowed three runs in the eighth inning, turning a blowout into a tense situation and raising concerns for later rounds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in the skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional white-collar paths. This shift is driven by concerns over substantial student loan debt and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating entry-level office jobs. A recent survey found that over half of Gen Z is worried about college costs, and 77% prioritize jobs that are difficult to automate. As a result, professions in the trades are losing their former stigma and are now seen as providing a secure and potentially lucrative career path, with some young entrepreneurs finding significant financial success without a college degree.</p>
