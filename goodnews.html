        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that reforming the country's "broken" benefits system is a moral necessity, following a U-turn on welfare cuts forced by a backbench Labour revolt. Speaking at a party conference, Starmer asserted that while the safety net for vulnerable people will be protected, the system should not trap those who are able to work. The government has already conceded on some of its stricter proposals for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and will now raise the health-related component of Universal Credit with inflation for existing recipients. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs are still pushing for more changes.</p>

          <p>Edward Molineaux, a 34-year-old personal trainer from Britain, has set a new world record by completing an incredible 465 half-marathons in a single year. He began jogging as part of his recovery from a hernia operation and transformed the habit into a record-breaking feat, logging over 6,000 miles. Molineaux structured his weeks to include 13 runs, sometimes completing multiple half-marathons in one day. He says his motivation comes from inspiring others and the mental resilience he develops by pushing through fatigue and discomfort.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a Maryland couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on the 10th anniversary of its nationwide legalization. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, their advocacy helped pave the way for Maryland to legalize marriage equality in 2012, two years before the Supreme Court's landmark decision. The couple, now married for over a decade, expressed joy in the progress made but also voiced concern over recent efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. They emphasized the importance of visibility and continuing the fight for equality.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has successfully invented a custom printer to create braille labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine capable of printing on the plastic beer labels used by Checkerspot Brewing Company. The students designed the printer with open hardware, allowing BISM's blind and low-vision employees to operate it easily. This invention will automate a previously manual process for an annual fundraiser supporting individuals with vision loss.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs, capping a week that began with significant geopolitical uncertainty following U.S. military action in Iran. Markets rallied after initial fears of a wider conflict did not materialize, and a corresponding surge in oil prices quickly reversed, easing inflation concerns. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by growing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by the end of the year, despite a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation reading. Tech stocks, particularly those related to AI like Nvidia, led the gains for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers studying skeletons from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey have found evidence suggesting it may have been a matriarchal society over 9,000 years ago. By analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons buried under homes, scientists discovered that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their maternal homes. The findings, which also noted more grave goods were buried with females, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly personally leading an aggressive campaign to recruit top AI talent from rivals like Google and OpenAI. According to reports, Zuckerberg has spent months creating a list of desired engineers and researchers, personally contacting them with lucrative compensation packages potentially worth up to $100 million. This hands-on effort is part of Meta's push to compete for dominance in the artificial intelligence space. The recruiting drive has caused a stir in Silicon Valley, with some competitors, including OpenAI's Sam Altman, calling the rumored compensation offers "crazy."</p>

          <p>A call to the California Highway Patrol about a baby tiger on the side of a highway in San Luis Obispo County led to a surprising and less exotic discovery. A driver reported seeing the stranded cub along a remote stretch of Highway 166. However, when an officer arrived to investigate, they found a deceased hawk, not a tiger. It remains unclear how the driver mistook the bird for a big cat. Officials noted that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without specific permits for facilities like zoos or shelters.</p>

Norris described his qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, stating he felt he was back to his best form after a season hampered by qualifying mistakes. The strong performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a front suspension revision designed to improve his feel for the car.

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people marched in the Budapest Pride event, defying a government ban in what organizers called the largest such demonstration in Hungary's history. The march was a direct rebuke of Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government, which recently passed a law outlawing events that "promote" homosexuality to minors, explicitly targeting Pride. Despite the risk of heavy fines and potential prison sentences for organizers, marchers filled the city center, supported by the Budapest mayor and numerous European officials. The event was seen as a major defense of both LGBTQ+ rights and broader democratic freedoms in the country.</p>
