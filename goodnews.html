          <h2>Cryptocurrency Prices Rise Amid Optimism for US Stablecoin Legislation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a rebound, with Bitcoin and Ether prices increasing, driven by renewed investor optimism that key stablecoin legislation could pass in the U.S. House this week. This recovery followed a brief dip after the House initially failed to advance two significant crypto bills, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act. Despite the legislative uncertainty, industry analysts and a statement from President Trump suggest the bills will eventually pass, which could provide regulatory clarity for the sector. The market's positive movement also saw gains for related stocks like Coinbase and Circle. (not investment advice)</p>

The rankings considered factors like educational attainment, STEM worker concentration, and state training programs. Following Texas, the top states include Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, which are recognized for attracting educated workers and implementing effective training initiatives to meet modern business demands.</p>

          <p>Model and author Emily Ratajkowski is making her return to acting in the new Netflix romantic comedy "Too Much," created by her friend Lena Dunham. Ratajkowski had taken a step back from her acting career around 2020 to reassess her professional life and priorities, during which time she fired her team and wrote a book. She explained that the role was written specifically for her and that working with Dunham as her first female director felt like a natural way to re-enter the industry. The series explores millennial themes of aging and fulfillment, which Ratajkowski relates to her own career reset.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the Patriot Parks Act, aims to permanently codify President Trump's executive order that increased National Park entry fees for international tourists. The legislation seeks to address the National Park Service's $23 billion maintenance backlog by requiring foreign visitors to contribute more, as American taxpayers already fund the parks. Proponents, including Senator Jim Banks and Congressman Riley Moore, argue the measure is fair and necessary to protect national treasures for future generations. This bicameral effort comes as the landmark Great American Outdoors Act funding is set to expire and park visitation numbers continue to rise.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a 2 trillion euro, seven-year budget that significantly boosts defense and space investment to 131 billion euros, a fivefold increase. This move reflects a broader European trend of rearmament in response to geopolitical instability. The budget framework, which must be unanimously approved by member states, also allocates 35% to climate projects, triples migration management funding, and includes 100 billion euros in support for Ukraine. To fund these initiatives without increasing member contributions, the EU plans to introduce five new revenue streams, including duties on e-waste and tobacco products.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's Virtua Health and Delaware's ChristianaCare are in discussions to co-found a new regional nonprofit health system, having signed a non-binding letter of intent. If established, the new entity would operate over 600 sites across four states—New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Maryland—and employ nearly 30,000 people. The partnership aims to enhance patient care, improve accessibility, and innovate within a challenging healthcare landscape marked by potential cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Both organizations will continue to operate independently while they negotiate terms and seek the necessary regulatory approvals for the ambitious venture.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 11:49:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a stellar performance from its trading division. The bank's traders generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion. This success is attributed to market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariff policies, which has benefited Wall Street firms. Investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% increase, reflecting a rebound in deal-making and further bolstering the firm's strong quarterly results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump revealed that First Lady Melania Trump has been influential in shaping his stance on the war in Ukraine, leading to a wave of positive reactions on Ukrainian social media. Trump recounted how his wife highlights the contradiction between his cordial calls with Vladimir Putin and Russia's subsequent missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. This insight into the First Lady's role, dubbed "Agent Melania Trumpenko" by some, coincides with the U.S. setting a deadline for a ceasefire and resuming arms supplies to Ukraine. Many Ukrainians believe her upbringing in the former Yugoslavia gives her a unique perspective on the Russian threat.</p>

          <p>A nurse who was suspended after complaining about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife. Sandie Peggie faced disciplinary action after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities at a hospital in Kirkcaldy. An internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support the allegations, which included misconduct and misgendering. The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, where Ms. Peggie is suing the health board and Dr. Upton for unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act, resumed after a five-month break.</p>

          <p>In a significant development, US Senate Republicans have agreed to exempt the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) from a broader package of spending cuts. The initial proposal sought to rescind $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, but bipartisan concern led to its preservation. The larger $9 billion rescissions package, which still targets foreign aid and public broadcasting, is being pushed by the Trump administration to reduce government spending. The reversal on PEPFAR funding was welcomed by global health advocates, who had warned that the cuts would threaten millions of lives, particularly in Africa.</p>

          <p>In a notable 2018 case, data from a Fitbit provided a crucial alibi for a Wisconsin man, Doug Detrie, who was initially the primary suspect in the 2016 murder of his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden. After Vander Heyden was found beaten and strangled, suspicion fell on Detrie, but his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was asleep at home. The device recorded only minimal movement, consistent with his account. This high-tech evidence, along with DNA from another man, George Burch, found at the scene, led to Detrie's release and Burch's eventual conviction, showcasing the growing role of wearable technology in criminal investigations.</p>
