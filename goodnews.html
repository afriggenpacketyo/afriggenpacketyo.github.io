          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker celebrated for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which debunked the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has passed away at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, explored the complexities of wartime Clermont-Ferrand through interviews with ordinary citizens, revealing collaboration and indifference towards the persecution of Jews and anti-Nazis. Initially banned from French television, "The Sorrow and the Pity" sparked controversy and critical acclaim, challenging the narrative fostered by Charles de Gaulle. Ophuls continued to direct documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "H√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," exploring themes of memory, justice, and the complexities of historical narratives.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price cuts on multiple electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, triggered concerns among investors about increased competition and a potential price war in the EV sector. Analysts expect the price cuts to drive increased foot traffic to BYD's dealerships, but other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline as investors reacted to the news. Despite the concerns, some analysts remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.

          <p>Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is intensifying its competition with Tesla in the electric vehicle (EV) market by unveiling its first electric SUV, the YU7. Xiaomi claims the YU7 will have a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge, surpassing Tesla's Model Y. Analysts anticipate that the YU7 will significantly erode Tesla's market share in China, especially given its expected price range of 250,000 yuan to 320,000 yuan ($34,700 to $44,420), which is competitive with the Model Y. Xiaomi plans to officially launch the YU7 and announce its price in July.</p>

          <p>Japan has begun selling government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to rapidly decrease soaring prices and meet a target of 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. The move comes in response to public criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices, which have been exacerbated by a poor harvest and broader inflationary pressures. The new approach involves releasing approximately 300,000 tons of rice directly to major retailers, bypassing the auction system that previously limited the government's influence over prices. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address the issue and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products.</p>

          <p>Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the hit show "Duck Dynasty" and the founder of Duck Commander, a duck hunting gear business, has died at 79. His death was confirmed by his son Jase Robertson, who did not specify a cause, though he had mentioned his father's early-stage Alzheimer's and other health problems last year. Robertson founded Duck Commander in 1972, and the television show, which ran from 2012 to 2017, revolved around the business and his family. The show garnered a large following for its humor and the family's values, though it occasionally courted controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old provision in U.S. customs law. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price of goods from the overseas producer to an intermediary, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the retailer. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff regime, with companies exploring its potential cost savings. To apply the rule, businesses must demonstrate that at least two sales occurred, the sales were carried out at arm's length, the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price is available.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep enables the brain to eliminate harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a metabolic by-product, signals the brain to switch to "repair mode" during sleep. The study confirms that increased H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels in sleep-regulating neurons trigger restorative slumber. This breakthrough offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases, as excess free radicals can disrupt sleep and cause inflammation.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Drew Gilpin Faust reflects on the original purpose of Memorial Day, formerly known as Decoration Day, and its significance in honoring those who died defending the promise of America. Drawing on Frederick Douglass's 1871 address at Arlington National Cemetery, the author emphasizes the importance of remembering what soldiers died for, particularly the preservation of democracy. At a time when democracy is again under threat worldwide, the author urges readers to consider the responsibilities passed down by historical figures like Douglass and Lincoln. The author suggests that we must uphold the legacy of those who sacrificed for freedom and stand up against threats to the principles they defended.</p>

The delay provided some relief to markets, but concerns remain about the ongoing trade tensions and their potential impact on the global economy.

The company employs a three-pronged approach, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, to identify and remove fake reviews. While vandalism accounts for some fake reviews, boosting and member fraud are more prevalent, with paid reviews being a smaller but more challenging category.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will delay the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9. The decision came after a conversation with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, who indicated a willingness to engage in serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs on June 1, but the call with von der Leyen appeared to ease tensions. Von der Leyen stated that the EU is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that United States Steel Corp. will remain under American control despite a "planned partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. Trump emphasized that the deal involves an investment and partial ownership, but control will be maintained by the U.S.A. Trump's approval followed a review by federal agencies of Nippon Steel's plan, though the details of the potential acquisition scheme remain undisclosed. Both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have expressed their support for the president's decision.</p>
