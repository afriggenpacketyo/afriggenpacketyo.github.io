          <p>Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, announced mixed fiscal first-quarter results, with earnings per share missing expectations despite revenue aligning with forecasts. The company, however, raised its full-year revenue growth projection, even as shares fell over 9%. Strong performance from its casual dining brands, driven by value offerings and marketing initiatives, helped offset weakness in its fine-dining segment. Darden's strategy of keeping menu price hikes below inflation has attracted price-conscious customers across income groups. (not investment advice)</p>

The storm is expected to intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend, potentially reaching Bermuda next week. Its current track is projected to carry it north of the Caribbean and away from land, minimizing immediate hazards. This season has been quieter than initially anticipated, despite NOAA's earlier predictions for above-average hurricane activity.</p>

          <p>Jose Mourinho has returned to Benfica as manager after a 25-year absence, signing a deal until 2027 following the dismissal of Bruno Lage. This appointment is seen as a high-stakes move for both Mourinho and Benfica, particularly with the club's presidential elections approaching in October. While Mourinho is revered in Portugal for his past successes, concerns exist about his recent track record and "conflictual style." The timing of his return raises questions about its political motivations for current president Rui Costa, adding an element of risk to this anticipated reunion.</p>

          <p>The IRS and U.S. Department of the Treasury have finalized rules for 401(k) catch-up contributions under the Secure 2.0 Act, requiring after-tax (Roth) contributions for workers earning over $145,000 annually, starting in 2027. This provision, intended to help fund the legislation, means higher earners will no longer be able to make pretax catch-up contributions.

Discussions focused on finalizing commitments for an economic prosperity deal, addressing British steel tariffs, and navigating the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The visit, marked by pomp and pageantry, yielded £150 billion in inward investment announcements for the UK. Despite their differing political backgrounds, the leaders appeared to establish an "unlikely friendship," contributing to a "flawless" visit from the UK government's perspective, though some protests occurred.</p>
