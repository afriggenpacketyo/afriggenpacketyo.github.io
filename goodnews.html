          <p>Despite initial setbacks due to conservative concerns over insufficient spending cuts, President Trump's budget package has moved forward in the House. Negotiations led to minor modifications, satisfying some holdouts who voted 'present,' allowing the bill to advance to the Rules Committee. The legislation, extending tax cuts and increasing military and border security spending, faces further challenges from both conservatives seeking stricter Medicaid requirements and blue-state Republicans concerned about state and local tax deductions. Speaker Johnson remains committed to passing the bill before Memorial Day, emphasizing ongoing discussions to finalize the details. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a four-day strike, NJ Transit engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) reached a tentative deal, ending the first rail strike in New Jersey in decades. While the specifics of the agreement remain undisclosed until union ratification, it's described as fair and fiscally responsible, involving work rule concessions. Train service will resume on Tuesday, allowing NJ Transit to safely reposition equipment and conduct necessary safety checks. The strike, driven by wage disputes and cost of living concerns, disrupted commutes for over 100,000 daily riders, highlighting the importance of a reliable transit system.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion in a closely contested race. Simion had previously won the first round, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race from the prior year which had been marred by claims of Russian interference. Dan's victory was secured with 54% of the vote, including significant support from Romanians who want to see profound change in Romania. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and maintaining support for Ukraine, contrasting with Simion's EU-critical stance and calls to cut aid to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer has reignited discussions regarding his health and past decisions. The diagnosis underscores that concerns about his age and potential health issues expressed by a majority of American voters were valid. This medical revelation might give him a new platform, and a newly sympathetic public, to attempt to defend and burnish his presidential legacy. While there is no reason to believe that Biden's prostate issues were at all apparent while he was in the White House, the fact that such an aggressive form of cancer could avoid detection until it had already spread, despite the wealth of medical support and evaluation available to Biden, will raise new questions and concerns.</p>

A recent trade truce led some investment banks to raise their forecasts for China's economic growth, though deflationary pressures persist and the government continues to implement stimulus measures to support businesses and stimulate consumption.

The article highlights the use of hormone therapy to cut off testosterone, androgen blockers, and advanced diagnostic tools like PSMA PET scans. Federal research funding has also played a key role in these advancements, leading to more optimistic prognoses for men with prostate cancer.</p>
