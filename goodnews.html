          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Paco Cerd√† reflects on a recent blackout that plunged the Iberian Peninsula into darkness for over 10 hours. Despite the potential for chaos and disorder, the author observes acts of kindness and solidarity, such as citizens directing traffic and strangers sharing food and water. Cerd√† contrasts this with the forces of individualism, arguing that the experience underscored the importance of community trust and mutual support, revealing the strength of the European welfare state in fostering a sense of collective responsibility. The article highlights the power of embracing joy and cooperation in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>Following recent local election successes, Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, now controls several local councils and has new mayors. The article examines what the party might do with its newfound power, focusing on Farage's vision of implementing a 'Doge' (Department of Government Efficiency) in every county to slash government spending. Reform UK aims to cut funding for climate change initiatives and Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion programs, focusing instead on essential services like social care and infrastructure. The article also addresses the party's stance on asylum seeker accommodation and the inexperience of many newly-elected councillors.</p>
