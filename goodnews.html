          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic successfully advanced to the second round of Wimbledon after overcoming a stomach issue during his match against Alexandre Muller. Despite dropping the second set and requiring a medical timeout, Djokovic rallied to secure a four-set victory. In a major upset, third-seeded Alexander Zverev was eliminated by Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in a five-set thriller. The early rounds have seen significant upsets, with several top-10 players in both the men's and women's draws, including Coco Gauff, exiting the tournament earlier than expected.</p>

          <p>In response to recent raids by armed, masked federal agents, a group of congressional Democrats has introduced the "No Masks for ICE Act." The bill would make it illegal for federal immigration officers to cover their faces during enforcement actions unless required for health or safety, and would mandate they display their name and agency on their clothing. The proposal aims to increase accountability, drawing parallels to laws already governing local police. The move follows a series of incidents in Southern California involving unidentified agents and a rise in cases of individuals impersonating federal officers, creating fear and confusion in communities.</p>

          <p>The World Boxing Association has officially ranked YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul as No. 14 in its cruiserweight division, a move that makes him eligible to compete for a world title. This decision came shortly after his unanimous decision victory over Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. The ranking is seen by many as a reflection of Paul's immense financial drawing power rather than his traditional boxing credentials, which include fights against other social media stars and retired athletes. Following his latest win, Paul expressed his desire to fight for a championship, potentially against current WBA champion Gilberto ‚ÄòZurdo‚Äô Ram√≠rez.</p>

The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% increase in first-quarter revenue to $228.2 million and a net income of $44.9 million. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public aims to allow the community to share in Figma's ownership and that the company will "take big swings," including through acquisitions.

          <p>France has enacted a new law that bans smoking in most public spaces, including beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries, in an effort to "denormalize" tobacco use. The move is a significant cultural shift for a country where over 30% of adults still smoke. Violators of the new rules face fines starting at 135 euros. The ban aims to protect public health, particularly children, as tobacco-related illnesses kill an estimated 75,000 people in France annually. One of the few remaining refuges for smokers will be the outdoor terraces of caf√©s and restaurants.</p>

For the Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is being strongly encouraged to enter the race and is reportedly considering it.

He explained that director Gareth Edwards encouraged him to write memorable, hummable melodies in the Williams tradition. Desplat, who is also making his North American conducting debut at the Hollywood Bowl, sees creating strong motifs as a potentially fading art in modern film scoring.</p>
