          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance.

The company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and global trade tensions, which CEO Daniel Grieder noted had already impacted first-quarter demand. Despite the uncertainty, Hugo Boss maintained its outlook for full-year sales to be in line with last year's figures.</p>
