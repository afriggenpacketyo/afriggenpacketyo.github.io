          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of Bitcoin rose by 2% to $108,955.10, with investors viewing it as an alternative store of value. Cumulative inflows into exchange-traded funds that track Bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion. Regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further drive Bitcoin prices higher. The Senate also voted to advance legislation creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins.</p>

Notre Dame is seeking a long-term extension, creating an impasse between the two rivals.

          <p>OpenAI is acquiring Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal. Ive will take on "deep creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io,". The io team, founded by Apple alumni, will merge with OpenAI to work more intimately with research, engineering, and product teams. OpenAI is paying $5 billion in the transaction, as it already owns 23% of the company. The purchase is OpenAI's largest and comes weeks after it agreed to buy AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion.</p>
