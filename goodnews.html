        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the New York appellate court's unanimous decision to throw out Judge Arthur Engoron's nearly half-billion-dollar fine against Donald Trump validates criticisms of the original trial. The author contends that the judge's penalty lacked legal and factual basis, as there were no financial victims, and was motivated by a political agenda driven by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The article characterizes the initial ruling as an unconstitutional and excessive punishment aimed at derailing Trump's political and business career.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 9-5, earning a split in their four-game series at Coors Field. The offense started strong with a two-run homer from Freddie Freeman in the first inning and continued to score in each of the first five innings, building an insurmountable lead. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win, allowing three runs over 5.2 innings before the bullpen closed out the game. The victory allows the Dodgers to maintain their division lead as they head into a crucial series against the second-place San Diego Padres.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming it excessive and likely unconstitutional. While the court upheld the underlying finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it concluded the massive fine was not justified by the harm caused in the commercial transactions. The ruling keeps non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, in place. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>China is considering its first revision to its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, cutthroat price wars that are damaging various industries. The proposed amendment, drafted by top economic planning and market regulation bodies, targets practices like selling products below cost to eliminate rivals. The move comes as sectors like the solar panel industry face severe overcapacity and loss-making sales due to intense price competition. Businesses are hopeful that stricter regulations will help stabilize markets and foster a more sustainable economic equilibrium. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory against Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory atmosphere at Selhurst Park was bittersweet, however, as it was overshadowed by the impending transfer of star midfielder Eberechi Eze to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's departure after the match, expressing frustration that the club had not secured a replacement sooner. The win represents a positive step in the club's European campaign, but the loss of a key player presents a significant challenge for the season ahead.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team has announced a jersey exchange program for fans following the trade of star player Djordje Mihailović to Toronto FC. Fans who purchased a Mihailović jersey can swap it for a new one featuring the team's record-signing replacement, Paxten Aaronson, or another player. Mihailović's request for a trade for "personal reasons" came as a surprise, and the club's rare offer is a gesture of commitment to its fanbase during the transition. Such exchange programs are uncommon in professional sports but serve as a way for teams to manage fan sentiment after the unexpected departure of a key player.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is publicly launched. This allows the investor to postpone paying taxes on the embedded profits until they sell the ETF shares. While the strategy can be highly effective, it has strict diversification requirements and can limit an investor's future flexibility, as their capital is then tied up in that specific ETF.

          <p>Recent market activity suggests a shift in how investors view the impact of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts on different stock sectors. Traditionally, lower rates boost high-growth tech stocks by increasing the present value of their future earnings. However, a recent rotation saw investors selling these secular growth names and buying more cyclical, value-oriented stocks like Home Depot, which stand to benefit more directly from lower rates through immediate upward earnings revisions. This article argues that Wall Street is now more focused on near-term earnings potential catalyzed by a dovish Fed rather than on abstract valuation models. (not investment advice)</p>
