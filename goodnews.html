          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that artificial intelligence will significantly alter work processes, leading to a reduction in the company's corporate workforce. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman alleges that Meta has attempted to recruit employees from OpenAI by offering substantial bonuses, potentially reaching $100 million. The rise of AI and cryptocurrency is expected to drive electricity consumption to unprecedented levels in the coming years, posing challenges to America's power grid. The newsletter also highlights advancements in robotics, including a four-legged robot named ANYmal-D capable of playing badminton, and Meta's partnership with Oakley to develop AI-powered performance glasses.</p>

          <p>This article argues that air conditioning is essential to the modern world, despite its environmental impact. Air conditioning saves lives by mitigating the dangers of extreme heat, allowing people to work productively in hot climates, and improving sleep quality. It has also enabled the development of industries like movie theaters and microchip manufacturing, and has facilitated the growth of cities in otherwise uninhabitable regions. The author calls for the development of more efficient and cleaner air conditioning technologies to address the challenges of a warming world.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with failing heart function and high antibody levels, received a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, after living with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for four years. Doctors used the liver transplant to combat her high antibody levels, which posed a risk of organ rejection. The successful surgery has paved the way for similar procedures, offering hope to other patients with complex medical conditions. Despite the success of the transplant, Baker faced tragedy when her husband died shortly after her recovery, leading to financial instability.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, reducing reliance on foreign software. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS) was evaluated on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat, demonstrating faster data updates and improved stability. The Lianli mission used a domestically produced chip, achieving a fully home-grown hardware-software solution for spacecraft operating systems. Yu Xiaozhou and colleagues are proposing national technical standards to guide the use of OpenHarmony in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions in China.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents while accompanying an undocumented man to a federal courthouse. Lander, who was asking to see a judicial warrant, was handcuffed after refusing to let go of the man, despite informing the agents he was a U.S. citizen. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Lander assaulted law enforcement, but video evidence contradicts this claim. The article contrasts this event with the recent conviction of Donald Trump, highlighting concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the targeting of immigrants.</p>

Litt, seeking to understand America's cultural divisions, learned to surf with Kappler, finding neutral ground for connection and an antidote to his own anxieties. The article highlights the challenges Democrats face in connecting with working-class voters and the importance of shared activities in bridging political divides. Litt argues that Democrats need to find new media voices that prioritize entertainment over politics to appeal to a broader audience.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Nvidia's dominance in the AI chips market and its impressive revenue and margin growth. However, it suggests that increased competition from companies like AMD, Intel, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Apple will eventually erode Nvidia's market share. The author believes that Amazon, as a major buyer of AI chips, could benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive, leading to lower prices and higher profits. The piece offers insights into the dynamics of the AI chips market and potential investment opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
