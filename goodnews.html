          <p>China has advanced its renewable energy efforts by launching a large-scale offshore floating solar power station in Qingdao. This project, part of a larger initiative by state-owned Sinopec, is situated in coastal waters and features solar panels that adjust with the tides. The station is expected to significantly boost energy generation efficiency due to the cooling effect of the water. Combined with a related project, it aims to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, substantially reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue, emphasizing the need for strict IAEA supervision. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions following recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian facilities. This diplomatic push positions China as a key mediator aiming to de-escalate the situation and prevent a potential nuclear disaster. Wang stressed that all parties must negotiate to place Iran's nuclear activities under comprehensive international oversight.</p>

          <p>Japan's national rugby team achieved a notable victory against Wales, winning 24-19 in a grueling match played in extreme heat and humidity. Despite trailing 19-7 at halftime, the Japanese side mounted a strong second-half comeback, scoring 17 unanswered points to clinch the win. The challenging conditions necessitated extended water breaks and a longer halftime, significantly impacting the game's flow. This defeat extends Wales' losing streak and marks a historic low in their world ranking, while it is a significant achievement for the Japanese team.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Paris has reopened parts of the Seine River to the public for swimming, a legacy project from the 2024 Olympics. Three supervised swimming zones have been established, complete with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards. This development follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve the river's water quality, which had been deemed unsafe since 1923 due to pollution. The initiative is celebrated as a major step in adapting the city to climate change and enhancing the quality of life for residents and tourists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. Their study, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key developmental compound. By reactivating a dormant genetic pathway, the scientists were able to achieve complete tissue restoration, including cartilage. This discovery offers hope that similar regenerative mechanisms could exist in other organs and potentially be activated in humans in the future.</p>
