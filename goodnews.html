Nutritionists caution that simply reducing ingredients can sometimes lead to the omission of fortified nutrients, and food scientists note that processed foods will remain essential for feeding a large population, and that new technologies can help produce products with higher nutritional retention and longer shelf life without significantly altering the physical structure and chemical composition of the food.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles is warning against a fake online advertisement posing as the DMV and offering discounted registration renewal services. Residents have reported seeing deceptive social media ads claiming to renew a vehicle registration at a 50% discount, but state law prohibits the DMV from offering such discounts. The deceptive advertisement asks for personal information and payment through unofficial channels such as social media sites and transaction applications, which the DMV will never do. The DMV advises residents to renew their vehicle registration directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>
