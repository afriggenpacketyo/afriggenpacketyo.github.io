          <p>Cybersecurity provider Netskope has raised its target valuation to $7.3 billion for its upcoming initial public offering, increasing its share price range from $15-$17 to $17-$19. This move could raise up to $908 million and reflects a strong market for tech and cybersecurity IPOs, following successful debuts by other companies. The planned Nasdaq debut, under the ticker "NTSK," comes amid a surge in major cybersecurity acquisitions, such as Google's purchase of Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' acquisition of CyberArk. The company, which specializes in cloud security, reported a net loss of $170 million for the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and solar are the most affordable forms of energy, according to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark. While the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided significant subsidies for clean energy, the Trump administration is phasing them out while expanding tax breaks for fossil fuels and imposing tariffs that raise costs for projects reliant on imports. Despite these policy changes and the higher upfront capital costs, the lower operating expenses and free fuel source for renewables make them more cost-competitive than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power.

          <p>Grammy-winning artist Cardi B is preparing to release her new album, titled "Am I the Drama?," which plays on her reputation for being outspoken and at the center of public controversy. In an interview with Gayle King, she explained that she does not enjoy conflict but believes her big personality and candid nature make her an easy target for drama. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, acknowledged that this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic." She stated that some of the drama in her life causes her significant stress.</p>

          <p>A framework deal for TikTok's U.S. operations is expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, involving both new and existing investors from its parent company, ByteDance. According to sources, the agreement will maintain Oracle's role as the cloud and data security partner for the platform. This development follows years of uncertainty after the U.S. Congress passed a bill requiring ByteDance to divest its American operations due to national security concerns over data privacy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that a framework deal has been reached with China, moving the popular social media app closer to resolving its status in the United States.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a military veteran and retired federal employee expresses feelings of being lost and ungrateful despite achieving an ideal retirement. The letter writer struggles with ennui while witnessing national and global turmoil. The columnist, James Parker, suggests this may be a form of survivor's guilt and advises the reader to embrace idleness and gentleness with herself, allowing the shape of her new life to emerge naturally. He posits that in a chaotic world, people who can savor existence and maintain their calm are valuable, reframing her current state not as pointlessness but as a quiet form of revolution.</p>

          <h2>The Reverse Mortgage 6-Month Rule and Its Implications for Heirs Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key feature of reverse mortgages, particularly federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), is the "6-month rule." This rule dictates that after the borrower dies or permanently leaves the home, their heirs have six months to repay the loan balance, typically by selling the property or refinancing. Lenders must issue a "Due and Payable" letter within 30 days of this qualifying event, starting the clock. While extensions are possible, this timeline emphasizes the need for homeowners with reverse mortgages to engage in careful estate planning and communicate clearly with their families to avoid a stressful deadline or potential foreclosure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring their full access to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. These limitations were imposed in 2021 by the Biden administration due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to nearly one million people born abroad without sufficient vetting. The reversal, which restores two-year travel authorizations, is seen as a sign of strengthening ties between Washington and Budapest under President Trump and Prime Minister Viktor Orban. U.S. officials stated that Hungary has now taken the necessary steps to meet the security standards required by the program.</p>

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, artifacts have been recovered from the wreck of the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. A deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and first-class silver trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. Launched in 1914, the Britannic was serving as a hospital ship during World War I when it struck a mine and sank. The recovered artifacts are now undergoing conservation in Athens and will be featured in a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's readiness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that prompted China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that commercial terms had been in place for months but were stalled by China after Trump's tariff announcements. The President's willingness to prioritize national security over the deal itself "turned the tide" in negotiations. With a divestment deadline approaching, this hardline approach appears to have successfully pushed ByteDance and the Chinese government toward finalizing an agreement for the app's U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>The 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill saw one of golf's greatest upsets, as Europe, led by captain Bernard Gallacher, defeated a favored American team on their home turf. Despite internal team selection controversies and trailing 9-7 heading into the final day's singles matches, the European squad mounted a stunning comeback. Key performances from players like Nick Faldo, who won a pivotal match on the 18th hole, and rookie Philip Walton, who secured the winning point, sealed the dramatic 14.5 to 13.5 victory. The win marked only the second time Europe had won the Ryder Cup in the United States.</p>
