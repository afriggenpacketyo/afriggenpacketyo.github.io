          <p>David Jolly, a former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump, has announced his candidacy for Florida governor as a Democrat. Jolly, who left the Republican Party in 2018, believes issues like affordability and public education funding will resonate with voters in 2026. He asserts that Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing the state and that the culture wars have become excessive. Jolly's run draws comparisons to Charlie Crist, another former Republican who ran for governor as a Democrat and lost to DeSantis in 2022.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to use effective contraception. The MHRA states it is unknown whether these medicines could harm an unborn baby and that they may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill in overweight or obese women. The regulator advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward before trying to become pregnant. The agency is concerned that the popularity of these drugs means many women are not using them safely or receiving proper advice.</p>

          <p>China has approved the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, marking a significant step in its aviation ambitions. This move comes shortly after the U.S. announced new export restrictions targeting China, including jet engine technologies. While the AES100 differs from the jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts consider its development a major advancement for the country's aviation sector. Li Gaiqi, chief designer of the AES100, stated the license reflects China's ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines.</p>

          <p>With an "above normal" hurricane season predicted, experts are urging homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. The NOAA forecasts 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 becoming hurricanes, including 3 to 5 major hurricanes. Homeowners should check their policy limits, deductibles, and flood insurance coverage. It is important to ensure that the policy limit would cover the cost of rebuilding the home, and to assess whether flood insurance is needed, as floods are generally not covered by standard homeowner's insurance.</p>

The console is a hybrid device that can be used as a handheld or plugged into a TV, featuring a bigger and brighter screen, more power, and increased storage. Despite the excitement, questions remain about whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor, partly due to the high price of games, such as Mario Kart World, which costs ¬£74.99. The original Nintendo Switch has sold over 150 million units since its 2017 release.</p>

Given trade tensions and the fact that Germany counts the U.S. as its biggest trading partner, Merz is expected to seek room for negotiation on tariffs and express support for a EU-US trade deal. The Russia-Ukraine war will also be a key topic, with Merz likely to reiterate Germany's support for Ukraine and the need for European involvement in peace negotiations. Merz will also aim to reassure Trump that Germany is increasing its defense spending to meet NATO obligations.</p>
