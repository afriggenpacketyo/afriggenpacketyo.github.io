          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" held the number one spot at the North American box office for a second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a significant 66% drop from its impressive debut, a steeper decline than other recent superhero films. The animated sequel "The Bad Guys 2" opened in second place with $22.2 million, while the comedy reboot "The Naked Gun" took third with $17 million. Analysts noted the slow start to August's box office but expressed hope that upcoming releases could help the summer season reach its $4 billion target.</p>

The incident, which occurred in June, involved activists damaging two military aircraft, causing an estimated £7 million in damages. The proscribed group Palestine Action claimed responsibility for the act, which was part of its campaign targeting arms companies since the start of the war in Gaza. Khalid faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place, and he has been remanded in custody.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Bergen County, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area on Saturday night. While the quake was minor and caused no reported injuries or significant structural damage, residents described a loud boom and brief, startling shaking. New York City Emergency Management confirmed that tremors were felt but that the city remained unaffected. This event follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the region in April 2024, which was one of the largest on the East Coast in the last century.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, marking a significant shift in the U.S. energy landscape. This growth is primarily driven by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are taking advantage of streamlined state regulations and favorable economics, making solar a cheaper option than natural gas. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints. Despite removing climate change from state policy, Florida's solar boom highlights the increasing financial viability of renewable energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. This move aims to combat the criminal gangs that facilitate dangerous crossings of the English Channel, a journey made by a record 25,000 people this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the criminals for selling false promises and leading migrants into life-threatening situations. The Labour government is under increasing pressure to address the "small boats" crisis and is also planning an overhaul of the asylum appeals process.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on situational hitting and aggressive baserunning rather than power to secure the win. After struggling to score for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through timely singles, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout. The victory gave the Dodgers a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip, providing some positive momentum despite ongoing concerns about the team's slumping offense.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions broadly unlawful, did allow for claims where commissions were unfairly large. The FCA will now consult on a formal redress scheme, expected to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payouts anticipated next year. The scheme is intended to cover agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over three miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a major earthquake in the region. Russian authorities stated that the ash was spreading eastward over the Pacific Ocean and that no populated areas were in its path. While there was a brief tsunami warning, it was later lifted. There is some discrepancy among scientific bodies as to when the volcano's last confirmed eruption occurred.</p>
