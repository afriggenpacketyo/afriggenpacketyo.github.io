          <p>Due to surging rice prices, which have reached record highs, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo in May and plans to open three more by next February to diversify its operations. Similarly, Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is strengthening its ramen noodle business, aiming to balance ingredient costs and address saturation in the beef bowl restaurant market.

          <p>A recent study indicates that visits by foreign tourists to locations related to manga and anime works in Japan have significantly benefited local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, or 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited places linked to anime or movies, a notable increase from 4.8 percent in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, up 53 percent from 2016. This trend, known as "seichi junrei," highlights the growing soft power reach of Japanese pop culture and its positive impact on regional economies, although local governments must address overtourism issues.</p>

This initiative is part of a government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that gene technology would enable the health service to "leapfrog disease, so we're in front of it rather than reacting to it".
