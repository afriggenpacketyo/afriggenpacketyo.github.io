          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ predicts that quantum computing will achieve a threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade superconducting systems, which it sells to over 50 countries. The founder and CEO, Xiang Jingen, compares the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that significant development is still required before the technology becomes broadly applicable. The company is positioning itself at the forefront of this emerging field.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas announced a significant drop in the number of people unaccounted for following the devastating floods in the Hill Country, with the figure falling from approximately 100 to just three. This sharp decrease is attributed to diligent follow-up work by state and local agencies, which successfully verified the safety of many individuals who were initially reported as missing. While this news is a profound relief, recovery efforts are still underway along the Guadalupe River watershed for the few who remain missing after the historic and deadly flooding event.</p>

Fostering this skill helps children develop authentic confidence, set healthy boundaries, and protect their mental health.
