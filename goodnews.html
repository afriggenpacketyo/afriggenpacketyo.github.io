          <p>A 12-year-old girl was injured in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, after an encounter with an alligator while swimming with a group of children. The girl sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries, possibly from a bite or claw, prompting authorities to remove the children from the water. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) stated the incident was likely not predatory, but the alligator was euthanized per protocol. Residents reported increased alligator sightings during daylight hours, leading the NCWRC to request notifications of large alligators exhibiting unusual behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has released new guidance on assessing applications for oil and gas projects, requiring operators to consider emissions from burning oil and gas, not just production emissions. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that climate impacts must include downstream emissions, potentially affecting projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the guidance provides clarity for the North Sea oil and gas industry. Climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely impact the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels and are incompatible with climate commitments, with the climate watchdog pausing decisions on licenses until the government clarified its position.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, commemorated annually on June 19, marks the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War. Also known as Freedom Day, Emancipation Day or America's second Independence Day, Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War. The name Juneteenth is a portmanteau that combines the words June and nineteenth. Public festivities often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops and other cultural events centered on art and cuisine. The holiday serves as a joyful anniversary of independence and an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

          <h2>The Cost and Complexity of Going Electric Must Be Reduced to Supercharge EVs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 10:18:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>If we truly want to supercharge switching, both the industry and the government have to be on the side of drivers. We need policies to incentivise and reward the right behaviours, but we also need to introduce propositions that take the cost and complexity out of going electric. Greener options need to be simple and affordable, rather than another thing for people to worry about. That‚Äôs why in most instances, EV charging at long-dwell locations, such as at home, is key to making life with an EV affordable, tapping into cheaper rates when there‚Äôs less demand on the electricity grid, for example.</p>

          <h2>Kids Cough Syrup Distributed Nationwide Recalled Due to Microbial Contamination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 10:13:25 EDT</div>

          <p>A children's cough syrup from brand Little Remedies is being recalled due to microbial contamination, according to federal health officials. In an alert from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday, Medtech Products Inc., the brands' manufacturer, voluntarily issued the recall due to the presence of Bacillus cereus, which can cause two types of food-borne illnesses, and loss of shelf-stability. The product, "Little Remedies¬Æ Honey Cough Syrup" with item number 7-56184-10737-9, was distributed nationwide in retailers and online from December 14, 2022 through June 4, 2025. So far, no serious adverse events have been reported, the FDA noted, but consumers who have the product should stop using it immediately.</p>

          <p>Students should be ready to be shocked and offended at university, according to the man in charge of ensuring free speech on campuses. Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), which regulates universities, told the BBC that exposure to views which students might find offensive was "part of the process of education". It comes as the OfS published guidance for universities in England on how a new law, designed to protect free speech, will work when it comes into force from August. From this summer, the new law will place a stronger responsibility on universities in England to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>National History Day (NHD), the annual US-based competition invites the top middle and high school students from more than half a million competitors to present their projects: documentaries, performances, websites, papers and exhibits on any topic from history, as long it adheres to the year‚Äôs theme. When I competed, the cardinal rule was to abstain from any citing of Wikipedia, a transgression that today seems nostalgically benign. Students now learn to hunt down reputable sources in an era defined by untrustworthy generative AI and revisionist histories. It‚Äôs this flavor of research ‚Äì active, firsthand, hands-dirtying ‚Äì that history professors at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, who started NHD in 1974, saw as the antidote to the traditional textbooks and multiple choice repetition that often went hand in hand with learning history.</p>
