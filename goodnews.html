          <p>American sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has won her first 100-meter world title at the championships in Tokyo, capping a dominant season with a spectacular performance. Her winning time of 10.61 seconds set a new championship record and established her as the fourth-fastest woman in history. The 24-year-old's victory was decisive, as she pulled away from Jamaican Tia Clayton, who took silver, and Olympic champion Julien Alfred, who won bronze. The achievement marks a remarkable comeback for Jefferson-Wooden after an injury-filled 2024 season and places her in elite company within the sport.</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition on the work of Gustave Caillebotte, one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While the museum has long housed his famous "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the new show, titled "Painting His World," offers a fresh perspective by highlighting his frequent focus on male subjects in domestic and intimate settings, which was unusual for the era. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers," were considered scandalous by the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition aims to re-integrate Caillebotte into the broader story of Impressionism and allow modern audiences to interpret his unique artistry.</p>

          <p>Actor and comedian Marlon Wayans is taking on a serious dramatic role in the new psychological horror film "Him," where he plays an aging football star who makes a sinister bargain with a rookie. Wayans, known for comedic projects like the "Scary Movie" franchise, explains that he drew upon recent personal losses, including the death of his mother, to access the deep emotions required for the role. In an interview, he reflects on his career, his upbringing in the famous Wayans family, and how his dramatic work is informed by real-life grief. The film represents a significant departure from his comedic roots.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the destructive Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants struggling with a drop in sales. The club, founded by a resident who lost her home, provides a vital economic boost to businesses and has also become a source of community and healing for those displaced by the tragedy. Members, many of whom were strangers before the fire, gather weekly to share meals and experiences, finding a sense of belonging and mutual support. This initiative serves as a model for post-disaster recovery, demonstrating how grassroots efforts can help rebuild both the local economy and social fabric.</p>

          <h2>Historians Discuss the U.S. Constitution's Original Intent for Amendment and Adaptation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 09:23:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a discussion about the U.S. Constitution, historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen emphasize that the document was designed to be a work in progress, not a static text. They note that the founders anticipated frequent revisions, and the initial ratification was contingent on adding the Bill of Rights to address states' concerns. The Constitution was also shaped by tragic compromises, particularly regarding slavery, which later required a "second founding" through amendments after the Civil War. Rosen argues that while modern political gridlock and an over-reliance on Supreme Court interpretations have strained the system, the Constitution's core principles of limited government remain timeless and essential.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Deploys AI-Voiced Summaries of Product Reviews, Raising Questions About Nuance</h2>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out "Hear the Highlights," a new feature that uses generative AI to create short audio summaries of products based on catalog descriptions, customer reviews, and other web information. While this tool could streamline the shopping experience and improve accessibility, especially for visually impaired customers, it also raises concerns about losing the nuance and specific insights found in individual human reviews. Critics worry that by distilling thousands of comments, the AI might overlook critical safety warnings or niche use-cases that are important to buyers. There is also a risk of blending marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team, has equipped his players with virtual reality headsets programmed to shout abuse at them. This unconventional training method is designed to prepare the team for the anticipated hostile crowd environment at the upcoming tournament at Bethpage in New York. Player Rory McIlroy revealed that he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want" to desensitize the team to the intense pressure and potential name-calling from American fans. The strategy is part of the team's detailed preparations as they aim to win the Ryder Cup on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are predicting the likely outcomes and highlighting the key factors for success. The Minnesota Lynx, who felt they were unjustly denied the 2024 title, are seen as a top contender on a "revenge tour," powered by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier and the league's best defense. The Las Vegas Aces, however, are entering the postseason on a 16-game winning streak, making them a formidable opponent aiming for a third title in four years. Other teams discussed as potential dark horses include the Atlanta Dream and the defending champion New York Liberty, who have battled injuries all season.</p>
