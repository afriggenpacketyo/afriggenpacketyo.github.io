Clark finished with 27 points and 11 assists, achieving her 350th career assist in just 42 games, the fastest in WNBA history. The Fever trailed for most of the game but mounted a late comeback, tying the score in the final minute. The game followed reports of a WNBA investigation into alleged 'hateful comments' directed toward Angel Reese during a previous game against Indiana.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering backing off from its demand for a complete removal of new U.S. tariffs, potentially conceding lower duty rates to reach a trade agreement with the United States. This shift comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, prepares for a third round of bilateral ministerial-level talks in the U.S. The Trump administration has already secured tariff-cutting agreements with China and Britain, placing pressure on Japan to compromise. Other news includes the resignation of Japan's farm minister and Rakuten supporting Ukrainian startups.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport to alleviate severe flight delays and cancellations. The restrictions, capping flights at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour, are a response to recent technology outages, staff shortages among air traffic controllers, and ongoing runway construction. United Airlines, which operates the majority of flights at Newark, has welcomed the measures. The FAA estimates a shortfall of air traffic controllers at the airport, exacerbating the existing staffing crisis nationwide.</p>

          <p>A new "ultra-rapid" genetic test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours. Scientists at the University of Nottingham, in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH), have developed the method. Surgeons describe the method as a "game changer" that could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, potentially allowing surgeons to perform more radical surgery during the initial procedure.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will permit use of COVID vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders said there was evidence to justify approval only for older people and those with medical conditions. The FDA anticipates the need for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo, before approving Covid vaccines for wider use. Some experts worry the new criteria go too far, erecting barriers for people who will want the shots.</p>

          <p>NFL owners are set to discuss a potential ban on the Philadelphia Eagles' signature "Tush Push" play, with a vote expected at the upcoming owners meeting. The play, which involves a quarterback sneak with additional pushing assistance from behind, has been a highly successful strategy for the Eagles. While some argue the play poses safety concerns, data suggests otherwise. The Packers‚Äô proposal cites ‚Äúplayer safety‚Äù and ‚Äúpace of play‚Äù as reasons for the ban, although many opponents of the play seem to focus on the former argument.</p>
