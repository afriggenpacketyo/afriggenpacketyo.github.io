          <p>In a personal essay, the author recounts how watching "The Muppet Show" became a source of comfort and a way to process grief following her father's death. Her father, Marshall Brickman, was a writer who had briefly worked with Jim Henson and was credited with creating the Swedish Chef's distinctive mock-Swedish language. Rediscovering the show with her own children, she found its blend of silliness and sophistication to be an antidote to her daily dread. The experience allowed her to connect with her father's memory and navigate the profound sense of loss through the surreal, comforting world of the Muppets.</p>

          <p>In one of the most thrilling Test cricket matches in recent history, India secured a victory over England by just six runs to draw the series 2-2. The final day at The Oval was filled with incredible tension as England neared a record-breaking target. The drama peaked when an injured Chris Woakes came out to bat with his arm in a sling to support his teammate. Despite a heroic effort, England fell just short, concluding what has been described as an outstanding and fractious series of sporting theatre.</p>

The company owns scores of businesses in resilient industries like insurance, energy, and transportation, and holds major stakes in blue-chip stocks. While its current stock price is considered reasonable rather than a deep bargain, the company is described as being built to last. The piece notes that even with Buffett's impending transition from the CEO role, the company's future looks promising under his successor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Independent Union Leader Dan Osborn Launches Senate Bid in Nebraska</h2>

          <p>Dan Osborn, an industrial mechanic and union leader who organized workers during the Kellogg's strike, is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska as an independent. Positioning himself as a working-class alternative to the wealthy incumbent, Osborn aims to break the two-party logjam in Washington. He outperformed expectations in a previous Senate race against a different Republican, narrowing the margin in a state Donald Trump won decisively. His campaign is seen as a test of whether a non-partisan, blue-collar message can gain traction in a deeply red state.</p>

          <p>A new survey of American children suggests that excessive screen time is not just a product of addictive technology, but also a consequence of restricted childhoods. The data reveals that while most children are not allowed to play unsupervised in public, they overwhelmingly prefer unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socializing. The article argues that kids turn to their phones because it is one of the few realms where they can interact without adult supervision. Restoring real-world independence is presented as the key to helping children put down their devices.</p>

          <h2>Global Fur Production Plummets Over 85% in a Decade Amid Ethical and Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 06:45:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global fur industry has experienced a dramatic collapse, with the number of animals farmed for their pelts falling from over 140 million in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This article explains the transformation, attributing it to a major shift in public perception that turned fur from a luxury good into an ethical misstep. The decline was driven by successful animal welfare campaigns pressuring major fashion brands, legislative bans across Europe, and the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks on mink farms. This represents one of the most significant advocacy victories of the 21st century.</p>

          <p>CK Asset Holdings has issued a formal statement on behalf of Hong Kong's wealthiest family, the Lis, to deny rumors that their residence of over 50 years is for sale. The company described social media speculation about the sale of the 79 Deep Water Bay Road property as "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." Victor Li, the company's chairman, urged the public and media not to trust or spread such rumors. The denial comes at a time when other prominent Hong Kong families have been forced to sell assets due to financial pressures.</p>
