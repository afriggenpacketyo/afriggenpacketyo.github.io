          <h2>First Malaria Treatment Specifically for Infants Approved for Use</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new malaria treatment formulated specifically for babies and young infants has been approved, marking a significant medical breakthrough. Developed by Novartis, the drug addresses a critical treatment gap, as infants previously received modified doses of medicine for older children, which carried a risk of overdose. The treatment, called Coartem Baby, is expected to be rolled out in African nations within weeks, where malaria disproportionately affects children under five. Novartis plans to introduce the drug on a not-for-profit basis, a move praised by public health experts for its potential to save countless lives and reduce healthcare inequality.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the UK is being highlighted by discussions over a potential new migrant returns deal. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to push for a "one in, one out" agreement, which would allow the UK to return migrants who cross the Channel to France in exchange for accepting asylum seekers with UK family ties. Several British newspapers are focusing on the issue, urging the Prime Minister to secure a firm agreement to stop the crossings. The King's speech at the state banquet will also emphasize the vital partnership between the two nations amid these ongoing political negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly 20-year-old policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the new procedure will be rolled out at major airports across the U.S., with the goal of expanding it nationwide to expedite screening processes. Passengers who are part of the TSA PreCheck program were already exempt from this rule. The original policy was implemented in 2006, years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a transatlantic flight, prompting a major shift in airport security protocols.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness and severe hearing impairment in a clinical trial. The research, conducted at Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet, involved delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All ten participants, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement within a month, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly all her hearing. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity Among Chinese Students as a Study Destination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as interest in studying in the United States wanes. Students cite cultural adjustment difficulties and safety concerns in the U.S. as primary reasons for the shift. In contrast, Singapore offers a familiar cultural environment, economic openness, and a reputation for high-quality education. While the U.S. has historically been the top choice, industry insiders predict a rise in applications to Singaporean universities, which already host a significant number of international students, including a large contingent from China, reflecting changing global education trends.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles City Council Advances Ordinance to Curb 'Renovictions'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." An amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent such evictions unless the landlord has a government agency order to vacate the property due to code violations. This follows a temporary measure enacted earlier this year to protect renters. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated, with landlords potentially required to cover all expenses and provide comparable temporary housing during legitimate, necessary renovations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This change marks a substantial loosening of previous regulations and has already led to an increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings. The policy, which has been progressively rolled out to include most of Europe and countries in Asia and Latin America, aims to simplify travel and attract more international tourists after a slow recovery following the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Caltech is terminating its partnership with the e-learning company Simplilearn in response to a class-action lawsuit that alleged the firm misrepresented its cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit claimed the program was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to changes, including refunding tuition to over 260 students. The university will also establish a new faculty committee to oversee its other professional education programs, marking a significant development in the scrutiny of university-linked online courses.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, which has eliminated the need for mass layoffs. The department had initially considered cutting its workforce by up to 15% to return to 2019 staffing levels. The reversal was met with criticism from some Democrats who argue the staff reduction is still too high and stems from a toxic work environment.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to the All-Star team for the 11th time in his career, receiving a special "Legend Pick" from the MLB Commissioner in recognition of his accomplishments. Kershaw expressed surprise and gratitude for the honor, acknowledging that his limited number of starts this season would not normally warrant a selection. Having recently achieved 3,000 career strikeouts, the 37-year-old is focused on his health after years of injuries. He is unsure if he will pitch in the game but plans to enjoy the experience, which he described as a "tremendous honor."</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on order for 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing their vulnerability in modern warfare. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the decision was influenced by the demonstrated effectiveness of drones and advanced air defense systems in conflicts like the one in Ukraine. Instead of investing in legacy platforms, the funds will be redirected toward developing and acquiring new capabilities like drones and smart systems. The move reflects a growing global reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role on a battlefield increasingly dominated by new and evolving threats.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced that they will not pursue legal action against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade, which had been officially prohibited by the government. The decision comes after Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declared the march an official municipal event, creating a legal gray area, as such events are exempt from assembly bans. Despite Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies and the threat of fines, the parade attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people. While participants will not be prosecuted, organizers, including the mayor, still face potential investigation and legal consequences.</p>
