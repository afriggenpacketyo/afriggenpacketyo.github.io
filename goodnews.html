          <p>Most markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw positive movement as investors anticipated upcoming discussions between the U.S. and Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's CSI 300 both recorded significant climbs, with the latter reaching its highest point since late 2024. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline, and Singapore reported a larger-than-expected contraction in non-oil domestic exports for July. The overall market sentiment was cautiously optimistic, partly influenced by hopes for potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which had previously fueled a strong week on Wall Street.

          <p>China's efforts to expand its global soft power are encountering a complex international landscape, marked by both successes and challenges. While Chinese-made cultural products like the "Labubu" dolls and popular streaming shows are gaining overseas fans, enthusiasm for learning Mandarin in Western countries appears to be waning. Analysts suggest this shift is influenced by China's economic situation and evolving global image. Internally, Chinese experts are urging the nation to better control its own narrative to counteract Western perspectives and strengthen its discourse power on the world stage.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This significant concession was reportedly made during the recent summit with President Trump and is being described as a potential "game-changing" development in negotiations to end the war. Such a guarantee would address one of Ukraine's primary security concerns and could offer a path forward, bypassing Russia's long-standing opposition to formal NATO membership for Kyiv. European leaders have welcomed the development but await further details on its practical implementation.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally, with the Shanghai Composite Index surging to a level not seen since August 2015. This increase in risk appetite is driven by investors moving funds from low-yield bonds and bank deposits into the stock market, creating a notable "wealth effect." The strong performance comes as a surprise to some, given recent official data indicating a general slowdown in China's economic growth momentum in July. Analysts believe the trend may continue, fueled by hopes for further stimulus measures from Beijing to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Pratt, who shares Jack with his ex-wife Anna Faris, expressed his pride in the young man his son is becoming. In the past, Pratt has spoken about how Jack's premature birth and early health scares profoundly deepened his religious faith. The actor has since remarried Katherine Schwarzenegger, and the couple has three children together, while he continues to co-parent Jack with Faris.</p>

          <h2>Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan Agree James Bond Character Should Remain Male</h2>

          <p>Dame Helen Mirren has stated that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be played by a man, despite identifying as a feminist. She argued that changing the character's gender would fundamentally alter the role into something else entirely. Her sentiment was echoed by former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a male actor should portray the spy. Their comments come as Amazon MGM Studios prepares for the 26th film in the franchise, with plans for a "fresh" take that still honors the character's legacy.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler claimed victory at the BMW Championship, capitalizing on a difficult final day for Scotland's Robert MacIntyre. MacIntyre, who started the day with a four-shot lead, struggled with a three-over-par 73, including two early bogeys that erased his advantage. Scheffler demonstrated his composure, finishing with a three-under 67, highlighted by a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole that secured his two-shot win. A frustrated MacIntyre expressed his disappointment after the round, unable to explain why his performance faltered so significantly under pressure.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts forecast that Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent. This trend highlights a strategic shift within these companies, as they increasingly focus on novel drug development, reducing their historical reliance on the sale of generic medications.

          <p>The Green Party in the UK is at a strategic crossroads as it holds a leadership election, with candidates debating the party's future direction. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bold "eco-populist" approach, aiming to connect with voter anger and challenge the elite more directly. In contrast, his opponents, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the more moderate, locally-focused strategy that led to record success in the last general election. The outcome will determine whether the party embraces a more radical tone or sticks with its proven formula for electoral growth.</p>
