          <p>The U.S. Navy is deploying a third destroyer, the USS Cole, to the southern border to support ongoing maritime border security efforts. This deployment aims to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, aligning with the administration's focus on integrated homeland defense. The USS Cole will take over duties from the USS Gravely, which recently seized an estimated 860 pounds of illegal drugs in the Caribbean Sea. These vessels work closely with the Coast Guard to intercept drug trafficking operations, enhancing deterrence and domain awareness in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at rebuilding America‚Äôs drone industry and tightening airspace security, potentially restricting Chinese manufacturers like DJI and Autel Robotics from the U.S. market. The orders cite concerns that foreign-made drones endanger the public and compromise critical infrastructure. The directives also call for federal investment in U.S. drone production to counter Chinese competition. DJI, based in Shenzhen, controls a significant portion of the U.S. consumer drone market.</p>

Playing his first international since November 2022 at the age of 35, left-arm spinner Dawson skillfully turned and deceived his way to 4-20 as England defended 189. Earlier Buttler was near his inventive and destructive best in hitting six fours and four sixes in his 59 balls. Victory extends England's winning start under new captain Harry Brook, who replaced Buttler after he resigned following the dismal exit at the Champions Trophy in February.</p>

          <p>Carney has invited his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to the upcoming G7 summit in Alberta, marking a shift in Canada-India relations that had soured in recent years. Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot and killed outside a Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia in June 2023. Trudeau alleged that agents of the Indian government were involved in the killing, while the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it had strong evidence that India was involved in orchestrating campaigns of violence and extortion on Canadian soil. Alongside India, Carney has also extended an invite to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum - though she said in late May that she was undecided on whether to attend.</p>
