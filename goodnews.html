          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help prevent future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund, educates students on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong habits and empower the next generation to protect their skin.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate over its career, is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket.

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The massive turnout was significantly larger than in previous years, with many attendees motivated by the government's attempts to ban the event under a controversial "Child Protection" law. The march was a celebration of human rights and solidarity, with Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declaring it a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The event highlighted the deep political divisions within Hungary over LGBTQ rights and civil liberties.</p>

Over two innings, Ohtani displayed overpowering velocity, with one fastball reaching a career-high 101.7 mph. Although his workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, he effectively attacked the strike zone and allowed no runs.

          <p>According to computer scientist and former Microsoft AI head Harry Shum, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of artificial intelligence, despite a significant gap in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum stated that while the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chip production, China is making substantial progress in developing sophisticated algorithms. He cited the Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI but with far less computing power. This focus on algorithmic innovation could allow China to overcome hardware limitations in the ongoing tech race.</p>
