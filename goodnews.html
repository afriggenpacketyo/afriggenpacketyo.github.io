          <p>A Cygnus cargo ship from Northrop Grumman, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, is set to arrive at the International Space Station after a delay. The rendezvous was postponed when two engine burns were prematurely shut down by a conservative software safeguard. NASA confirmed the issue has been resolved and the spacecraft is operating as intended. Astronauts Jonny Kim and Zena Cardman will use the station's robotic arm to capture the Cygnus XL, an upgraded, larger version of the craft making its maiden flight. The mission is crucial for restocking the station with consumables, spare parts, and research materials.</p>

          <p>Asian markets showed mixed results after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an expected interest rate cut, which Chairman Jerome Powell described as a risk management measure. Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark surged to a new record, rising nearly 0.6%, with technology and real estate sectors leading the gains. Meanwhile, markets in Hong Kong and mainland China saw slight declines, while South Korea's Kospi edged higher. The Fed's move, along with indications of two more potential cuts this year, has shifted focus to the Bank of Japan's upcoming policy meeting, where rates are expected to remain steady.

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the U.K. was highlighted by a grand banquet at Windsor Castle, a meticulously planned diplomatic event designed to honor the visiting leader. The guest list was notably focused on political figures and technology executives rather than celebrities, with attendees including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other senior UK politicians were also present. President Trump was seated between King Charles and Catherine, Princess of Wales, at the head of a 47-meter-long table in St George's Hall, underscoring the formal pageantry of the occasion.</p>

          <p>This opinion article highlights the story of Gong Sheng, a student who chose to pursue culinary arts at a tourism college despite having the opportunity to follow a more traditional academic path. The author argues that such decisions, while uncommon in China's highly competitive society, are a positive sign that young people are becoming more certain about their passions. The piece suggests that in the current economic climate, it is beneficial for both individuals and society to support young adults who step off the beaten track. It frames this trend as a move toward greater personal fulfillment and self-determination.</p>

          <p>At New York Fashion Week, runway music is more than just background noise; it is a vital tool for designers to convey the mood and message of their collections. This article explores how soundscapes at shows for brands like Eckhaus Latta, Collina Strada, and Diotima shape the audience's perception, creating feelings of nostalgia, disorientation, or arousal. From custom compositions featuring whispered poetry to DJ sets blending club music with unsettling audio collages, the music serves as crucial information.

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called AI Fluency, which will require all undergraduate students to study artificial intelligence, beginning with the class of 2029. The program aims to ensure every graduate is proficient in both their chosen major and the applications of AI. This move responds to a dramatic increase in job listings demanding AI skills, which have grown by over 600% in the last decade in the U.S. By integrating AI coursework and workshops across all disciplines, the university hopes to give its students a competitive advantage in a workforce that is rapidly being transformed by this technology.</p>

The device is controlled by hand gestures via a neural-powered wristband. This product serves as a bridge between the company's previous audio-only smart glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. The glasses, developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, will go on sale in the U.S. on September 30.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Currently, the storm is tracking northwest over open waters and poses no immediate threat to land. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate that Gabrielle will intensify over the weekend and could potentially develop into a low-grade hurricane by Sunday. While its long-term path remains uncertain, projections suggest it could approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen. The formation comes about a week after the historical peak of the hurricane season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume a significant amount of alcohol through their diet of ripe, naturally fermenting fruit. By testing the figs and plum-like fruits that chimps eat, scientists determined the average alcohol content and calculated the primates' daily intake. The study found that a chimp consumes about 14 grams of ethanol per day, which is roughly equivalent to two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. This finding provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests our own attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits.</p>

Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official target, the central bank is unlikely to risk another cut this year.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making drastic portfolio changes. He argued that the move was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter the major themes driving the market, such as the strength of technology and artificial intelligence sectors. Cramer suggested that the mixed market reaction, which saw the Dow rise while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell, may have been due to some investors hoping for a more aggressive cut. He concluded that the Fed's prudent, steady approach was exactly what the economy needed. (not investment advice)</p>
