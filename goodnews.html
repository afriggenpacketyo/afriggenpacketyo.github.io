          <h2>Weight-Loss Medications Show Promise in Reducing Alcohol Consumption, Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:02:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that GLP-1 medications, commonly used for weight loss and diabetes, may also help heavy drinkers reduce their alcohol consumption by nearly 70%. The study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity, found that these drugs, like semaglutide and liraglutide, were more effective than nalmefene, a drug specifically approved for reducing alcohol intake. Researchers believe that GLP-1 drugs may affect brain chemicals tied to pleasure and fullness, thus reducing cravings for alcohol. Participants in the study also experienced an average weight loss of 17 pounds over four months, though the study lacked a control group and relied on self-reported drinking habits.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff identified a suspicious meeting invitation as a "spear-phishing" attempt and reset passwords for all users across the education service as a precaution. While the council assures that no data has been compromised, the incident follows a suspected criminal ransomware attack on schools in West Lothian earlier in the week. Students have been told they can access their personal revision materials by going to their school on Saturday to obtain a new password.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection, with cases remaining unusually high in 2025. The virus is spread through the oral-fecal route, often affecting unhoused individuals and travelers to areas with poor sanitation, though recent cases have occurred in people without these risk factors. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, and yellowed skin and eyes, with severe symptoms more common in older adults and those with weakened immune systems. The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination, and officials emphasize the need to reassess prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns about heat damage to crops in China's agricultural heartlands. The purchases from Australia mark the first such transaction since last year. Despite these imports, analysts caution that China possesses substantial wheat inventories, potentially limiting further purchases. The shift in import activity reflects adjustments to global grain supplies and trade dynamics amidst weather-related agricultural challenges.</p>
