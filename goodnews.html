          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels from hard-to-reach coves and mudflats. The DNR opts to airlift boats to avoid disrupting the marine environment. Since 2002, the department has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels. Squaxin Island is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The tribe supports the cleanup effort to maintain clean beaches and water for future generations. The operation highlights the ongoing challenge of managing derelict vessels and protecting aquatic environments.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers. The study suggests that the development of flight feathers was crucial for early birds to surpass dinosaurs in flight capabilities. Researchers examined feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was an essential feature of bird evolution. While most feathered dinosaurs could not fly, scientists believe that some species could glide or have powered flight. The study was published in the journal Science Bulletin.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria infants encounter after birth may protect them from dangerous infections. The study showed that specific bacteria, like Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns to identify the species present and tracked the babies' health for two years. Babies with B. longum were less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. The findings suggest that early microbial exposure plays a crucial role in immune system development.</p>

          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The order halts work on the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. Sable Offshore Corp. is now targeting August 1 for first sales due to the delay. The ruling was celebrated by environmental groups who seek public input and scrutiny of the project. The 2015 Refugio oil spill continues to fuel opposition and concern about the project.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. It is unknown whether these medications, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are concerned about the unsafe use of GLP-1 medicines. Many women are buying these prescription medicines from unregulated sellers without medical advice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterwards. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less effective in overweight or obese women.</p>
