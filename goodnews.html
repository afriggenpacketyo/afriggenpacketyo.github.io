          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the United States rose 76% in April year-on-year, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China. The surge contrasts with a 76% drop in shipments from China over the same period. While the Trump administration exempted iPhones from reciprocal tariffs, Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterated plans for most iPhones sold in the US to be manufactured in India. Analysts predict that growth will plateau due to India's limited manufacturing capacity and potential protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data suggests a political split within Gen Z, with "Old Gen Z" (25-29) leaning more Democratic and progressive, while "Young Gen Z" (18-24) shows more curiosity toward Trump and skepticism of the status quo. Harvard Youth Polls indicate that younger Gen Z voters hold more favorable views of Republicans in Congress and Trump than their older counterparts. Yale University's youth poll reflects similar divisions in political identification and preferences, with younger Gen Z men and women expressing more Republican-coded opinions on various policy issues. The article suggests this trend could challenge the notion of younger voters being inherently more progressive.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson indicated that the government is considering removing the two-child benefit cap, acknowledging its contribution to poverty. The policy prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Phillipson warned that unwinding the policy would be costly but emphasized that the "cost of inaction" is also high due to the impact on children's life chances. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy.</p>
