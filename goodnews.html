          <p>Syrians are increasingly expressing openness to peace with Israel, marking a significant shift in the region's political landscape, as direct talks between Syria and Israel have occurred, facilitated by the U.S. These discussions, focused on border security, signal a potential departure from decades of hostility, influenced by President Trump's engagement with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. While the talks are in early stages, they represent a move towards normalization, driven by a desire for economic development and stability within Syria. This shift also reflects a growing rejection of using the Palestinian cause to justify internal oppression.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. universities, often divided by internal strife, are finding common ground in opposition to the Trump administration's efforts to defund research, increase endowment taxes, and dictate admissions and faculty appointments. This campaign has united faculties, student bodies, donors, and alumni groups who recognize the threat to academic freedom and institutional autonomy. The administration's actions, including banning diversity programs and imposing demands on universities in exchange for federal funding, are viewed as an overreach that could harm the sector's global standing.
