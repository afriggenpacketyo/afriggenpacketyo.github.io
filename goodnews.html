          <p>Quantitative investment firm AQR Capital Management has seen several of its hedge funds significantly outperform the market in the first half of 2025. The firm's Apex and Delphi funds reported gains of 11.4% and 11.6% respectively, more than doubling the S&P 500's year-to-date return of 5.3%. The success comes amid a volatile market environment influenced by trade wars and geopolitical tensions. AQR, co-founded by Cliff Asness, has grown its assets under management to $142 billion.

          <p>Official figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal a 14.2% increase in babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in England and Wales in 2024 compared to the previous year. This trend occurred alongside a slight overall rise in births in England for the first time since 2021, while births in Wales decreased. The data also confirms the continuing pattern of people starting families later in life, with a drop in births to mothers under 30. Experts find the rise in older fathers notable, especially as male fertility generally declines with age.</p>

          <p>To determine if a company's culture is a good fit, job seekers should ask hiring managers, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" According to NYU professor and author Suzy Welch, this question cuts through generic corporate platitudes and elicits honest, revealing answers about a company's true values. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" or "someone who's too social" offer genuine insight into daily work life. Welch advises asking this disarming question late in the interview process, ideally after an offer is made, to best gauge alignment with personal values.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company announced that its second-quarter sales rose by 14.2% over the same period last year, a figure that significantly outpaces the estimated 1.4% to 2% growth for the auto industry as a whole. The automaker sold over 612,000 new vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks and a 23.5% increase in hybrid vehicle sales. However, sales of fully electric vehicles saw a notable 31.4% decline during the quarter. The results come as the industry navigates the effects of 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts implemented earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of Spanish goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from rival club Chelsea for a ¬£5 million fee. The 30-year-old, who remains the world's most expensive goalkeeper following his ¬£71 million move to Chelsea in 2018, joins the Gunners on a three-year contract. Kepa spent last season on loan at Bournemouth and previously helped Real Madrid win La Liga and the Champions League during a loan spell. His arrival at the Emirates Stadium is expected to provide experienced competition for current Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Significant Inflation in the U.S.</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a major spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. The ongoing uncertainty and frequent changes in trade policy have also made businesses hesitant to pass on costs immediately. However, experts caution that this buffering effect is likely temporary and expect prices to rise later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The genre of literature exploring kink and BDSM has evolved from a niche category to a mainstream presence, reflecting broader societal shifts in accepting non-conventional sexual practices. This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core," which delves into the world of a San Francisco sex worker, exploring themes of identity, loneliness, and the psychological complexities of the industry. The piece contrasts such fictional explorations, which retain a sense of fantasy and intrigue, with nonfiction works that often aim to demystify and normalize kink. It highlights how literature is mapping the complex terrain where transgressive desires meet the pursuit of legitimacy.</p>
