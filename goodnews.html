          <h2>Texas Roadhouse Shows Resilience Despite Inflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 19:51:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported slightly disappointing first-quarter results due to inclement weather, but promising signs of a stronger second quarter boosted investor confidence. The company's comparable store sales slowed to 3.5%, driven by traffic and average check increases, but exceeded consensus estimates. Despite an increase in commodity cost inflation outlook, Texas Roadhouse reaffirmed most of its 2025 outlook, indicating continued positive comparable sales growth and store week growth. The article suggests that Texas Roadhouse's brand strength and customer value proposition position it well to navigate economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing mounting pressure to allow players the choice between wearing skorts or shorts in matches, with a Special Congress scheduled to vote on the issue. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues that enforcing skort wearing is inherently sexist and that comfort should be prioritized.
