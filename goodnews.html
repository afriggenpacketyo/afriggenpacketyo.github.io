          <p>Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings, with sales growth driven by demand for its GPUs in the data center division for AI applications. However, U.S. export controls are impacting sales in China, which Nvidia estimates to be a $50 billion market. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of the data center revenue, and the company is focusing on the potential for its GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers through AI inference. Nvidia's Blackwell chips are designed to meet the surging demand for reasoning AI, but the export controls are driving AI talent to use chips from homegrown Chinese rivals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking President Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs that the court ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are the bulk of what the UK exports to the US. Although the UK has a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, that deal is yet to come into force. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods entering the US, such as products like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. Today's leading accounts come with strong returns that can be locked in for the term of the CD and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured on balances up to $250,000. To get a good CD rate, it is advised to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs, which often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve (not investment advice). A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long-term.</p>

          <p>The article outlines the current average mortgage and refinance interest rates, as of May 29, 2025, noting that actual rates may vary based on location, credit, and loan type. The average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.14%, and the 30-year mortgage rate is 6.95%, while average refinance rates are similar. To secure a great rate, borrowers should strengthen their credit profile, shop around, and compare different lenders, and borrowers may soon see some relief if the Fed decides to pause rate hikes following its July rate increase (not investment advice). Shorter loan terms generally offer better interest rates, and borrowers should factor in fees and lock in their rate after making a decision.</p>

          <p>MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace is launching a new podcast called ‚ÄúThe Best People,‚Äù featuring conversations with actors, musicians, and thought leaders outside of politics. This move comes as MSNBC looks for more ways to reach consumers who are no longer watching cable TV, with the network planning to spin off into a new company called Versant. Wallace's podcast will focus on her guests' advocacy issues rather than instant political analysis, and she believes the podcast format allows for more candid conversations.

          <p>As President Trump approaches the end of his second term, his doctors should be having candid conversations with him about his health, potential risks, and goals of care, according to this article. The article argues that aggressive screening for conditions like prostate cancer, heart disease, and cognitive impairment may be warranted, given the potential impact on the country. The author suggests that Trump's doctors should also discuss his lifestyle choices and the potential negative effects on his health. A goals-of-care conversation would help Trump think through how to separate political pressures from personal needs and family responsibilities.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Futures Surge After Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Stock market futures jumped after a federal court froze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled President Trump had overstepped his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy in April, and overseas markets also rose following the surprise legal decision. The ruling means the baseline 10% tariff, reciprocal tariffs on dozens of other nations, and other levies are void, but the Trump administration said it will appeal the ruling (not investment advice). The ruling by the three-judge panel means the baseline 10% tariff; so-called reciprocal tariffs on dozens of other nations that the U.S. had paused for 90 days; a 20% levy on China related to fentanyl; and a 25% tax on certain imports from Canada and Mexico are void.</p>
