          <p>OpenAI announced a major partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), involving a multi-year deployment of AMD's GPUs for its AI infrastructure. The deal includes a warrant that could give OpenAI up to a 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker, representing a strategic move to diversify its suppliers beyond Nvidia. This partnership is a significant commercial milestone for AMD, validating its position in the competitive AI hardware market and boosting its stock value considerably. The agreement highlights the increasingly interconnected corporate economy within the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese brewing giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at its six breweries in the country following a disruptive cyberattack. The attack affected the company's ordering and delivery systems, leading to a production halt and causing major retailers to report low stock levels of popular beers like Asahi Super Dry. While the breweries are not yet at full capacity, the resumption of production for beer, soft drinks, and food products marks a step toward recovery. This incident is the latest in a series of cyberattacks impacting major global corporations and their supply chains.</p>

          <p>Turkey has become the world's leading destination for hair transplants, attracting around one million people in 2022 and generating approximately $2 billion for its economy. Patients, primarily from the U.S. and Europe, are drawn by significantly lower costs, with procedures costing a fraction of what they would in their home countries. While the industry is booming, concerns have been raised about the risks associated with unlicensed "black market clinics" and a lack of stringent oversight. The trend is heavily fueled by social media, which has normalized the procedure and transformed it into a popular lifestyle upgrade.</p>

          <p>Former Representative Katie Porter has received a significant endorsement from EMILY's List, a powerful Democratic organization that supports female candidates who advocate for abortion rights. This backing could provide a substantial boost in funding and grassroots support for her 2026 campaign to become California's first female governor. The organization, known for its principle that "Early Money Is Like Yeast," has a long history of successfully backing Democratic women, including Porter's previous congressional campaigns. The endorsement positions Porter strongly in a wide-open race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom, where she currently holds a slight lead in the polls.</p>

          <p>Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, reported that its programs saved a record 1.7 million lives in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year. The success highlights the compounding power of routine immunizations against diseases like measles and polio, especially in fragile nations. This progress comes alongside major breakthroughs, such as the rollout of the first malaria vaccines in 17 African countries. Despite these gains, the article warns that progress is threatened by declining global health funding, the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment in wealthy nations, and the challenge of reaching over 14 million infants who received no vaccines at all.</p>

          <h2>UK Conservatives Propose £5,000 Tax Rebate for Young First-Time Home Buyers</h2>

          <p>The Conservative Party has announced a plan to offer a £5,000 tax rebate to young people in their first job to help them save for a home deposit. Under the "First Job Bonus" proposal, the first £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions would be redirected into a savings account. The party also pledged to abolish business rates for high street retail, hospitality, and leisure firms to support local economies. These policies would reportedly be funded by a £47 billion annual savings drive, achieved through significant cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, host nation Italy will have four flag bearers for the opening ceremonies of the upcoming Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. Two athletes will carry the flag at the main ceremony in Milan's San Siro stadium, while two others will do so simultaneously at a smaller event in Cortina d’Ampezzo. For the first time, the games will also feature two Olympic cauldrons, one in each host city, celebrating Cortina's heritage as the host of the 1956 Games. The decision reflects the geographically dispersed nature of the 2026 games, which will be held across multiple venue clusters in northern Italy.</p>

          <p>Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency room physician in Rwanda, has shared her experience from the front lines of the country's 2024 Marburg virus outbreak. A year after the successful containment, she recalls the fear and exhaustion of treating colleagues, many of whom died, and the difficult decision to send her own young children abroad for safety. The article highlights Rwanda's effective response, which achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded for a Marburg outbreak by rapidly implementing testing, isolation, and clinical trials for vaccines and treatments. Firew contrasts this with other global health crises, emphasizing what can be achieved with a strong belief in science.</p>

          <p>Fifth Third Bancorp has agreed to acquire Comerica for $10.9 billion in an all-stock deal, creating what will be the ninth-largest bank in the United States with approximately $288 billion in assets. The transaction, expected to close in early 2026, aims to enhance Fifth Third's presence in high-growth markets and strengthen its commercial banking capabilities. The announcement caused Comerica's shares to rally significantly in premarket trading, while Fifth Third's stock saw a slight decline. The merger is fueling expectations of further consolidation within the regional banking sector amid a climate of easing regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legendary Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who recently announced his retirement, is concluding his illustrious career with a new role in the postseason bullpen. This shift mirrors the final season of Hall of Famer Greg Maddux, who also finished his career as a reliever for the Dodgers in 2008 when Kershaw was a rookie. Despite still being highly effective, Kershaw has embraced the change, stating his priority is to help the team win in any capacity. The move is possible due to the Dodgers' unusual depth of healthy and effective starting pitchers available for the playoffs this year.</p>

          <p>The animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has become a surprise cultural phenomenon and is now Netflix's most-watched movie of all time. The film, which follows a K-pop girl group who secretly hunt demons, also boasts a massively successful soundtrack with four songs simultaneously in the Billboard Hot 100 top 10. Originally produced by Sony Pictures Animation, the project was passed on for distribution and later picked up by Netflix under a first-look deal. Cultural critics attribute its success to its authentic embrace of K-pop culture without trying to over-explain it for a Western audience.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender Nico O'Reilly, 20, has been called up to the senior England squad for the first time.

O'Reilly, who primarily plays as a left-back for his club, will step up from the Under-21s for the upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia. His inclusion follows a breakout season where he established himself in Manchester City's first team, making 21 appearances and scoring five goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. government has unveiled a proposal to reform the house-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and failed sales. The plan would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduces the option of binding contracts to prevent last-minute withdrawals or "gazumping." Officials estimate these changes could save first-time buyers over £700 and shorten the transaction time by four weeks. However, the proposal draws comparisons to the previously failed Home Information Packs and faces scrutiny over its potential to increase initial costs for sellers and its effectiveness in addressing broader housing affordability issues.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Shimon Sakaguchi of Japan and U.S. researchers Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell. Their collective work led to the discovery of regulatory T-cells, a crucial component of the immune system. These cells act as "security guards," preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues, a process known as peripheral immune tolerance. Their discoveries have been fundamental to understanding and developing new treatments for autoimmune diseases, where this process fails, and for cancer, where these cells can hinder the body's ability to fight tumors.</p>
