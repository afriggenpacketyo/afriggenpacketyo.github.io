          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin around midnight EDT, involving two 12-hour periods. The announcement came two days after the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear targets in response to Israel's initial strikes. Prior to the ceasefire announcement, Iran fired missiles targeting Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, raising concerns about escalation, but a U.S. official said the missiles were intercepted with assistance from Qatar. Trump congratulated both countries on having the stamina, courage, and intelligence to end what he called 'THE 12 DAY WAR.'</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued an injunction, blocking the Trump administration from implementing a plan to bar foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. The injunction extends a previous temporary order preventing the administration from enforcing a proclamation citing national security concerns. Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against the university for refusing to accede to demands to control its governance and curriculum. The university has filed lawsuits seeking to unfreeze funding and prevent the administration from blocking international students, citing free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China's largest inland city, has evolved into a hub for international trade, driven by two cross-border rail networks connecting to Europe and Southeast Asia. These routes offer faster and more reliable access to global markets, positioning Chongqing as a central node in the global economy. The city aspires to become a rail-based "Suez Canal," facilitating trade between Asia and Europe. Shipping goods from Asean to Europe via Chongqing is reportedly 10 to 20 days faster than traditional sea transport, highlighting the city's strategic importance amid rising geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>Speech and Language UK warns that children with speech and language issues are at greater risk of developing mental health problems like anxiety and depression. The charity reports that almost half of young people referred to mental health services also face serious speech and language challenges. Difficulties with learning new words, understanding non-verbal cues, or stammering can impact a child's ability to express their feelings. The charity advocates for better training in speech and language for teachers, school support staff, and mental health professionals to identify language issues early and provide appropriate support.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to reform prior authorization practices. The pledge aims to standardize approvals, deliver faster decisions, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, and honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers. The practice has been criticized for delaying or denying care, with a previous pledge in 2018 failing to meet expectations. Some states have implemented regulations to address prior authorization issues, while the federal government relies on voluntary measures.</p>

          <p>Before flying missions that can exceed 40 hours, B-2 Spirit stealth bomber pilots undergo weeks of preparation, focusing on flight plans and nutrition. Pilots are trained to understand how food affects alertness and digestion during long flights. B-2 pilots are trained to be cognizant of foods and how they slow or speed digestion - critical in an aircraft with a single chemical toilet. The B-2's success relies on human performance, with its two-person crew requiring extensive support from planners and maintainers. The B-2 costs about $65,000 per hour to operate, according to Pentagon data.</p>

          <p>President Trump called Iran's missile attack on an American base "very weak" and did not indicate that the U.S. would respond militarily. He urged both Iran and Israel to pursue peace, striking a de-escalatory tone. While reserving the right to respond, there are no active plans for the United States to retaliate at this time. Trump credited early notice from Iran for preventing casualties. His response contrasted with earlier warnings to Iran not to retaliate following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
