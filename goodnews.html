          <h2>Tripadvisor Finds Increased Fake Reviews in 2024 Due to Policy Changes and Detection Improvements</h2>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. The increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against "incentivized reviews," where businesses offer rewards for positive feedback. Tripadvisor's system relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fraudulent reviews. The company acknowledges the ongoing "cat and mouse" game of rooting out fake reviews and emphasizes its commitment to continuous improvement in detection methods.</p>

Tage Thompson scored the decisive goal, and Jeremy Swayman's goaltending contributed to the shutout. Following the win, the team paid tribute to Johnny Gaudreau, an NHL player who tragically passed away, by displaying his jersey during the celebration.

          <h2>Aston Villa Protests Referee Decision After Controversial Call at Old Trafford</h2>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a controversial refereeing decision during their match at Old Trafford. The incident involved a disallowed goal, with the referee blowing the whistle before the ball entered the net, preventing VAR intervention. Villa captain John McGinn criticized the decision as "incredible," while BBC pundits Alan Shearer and Michael Richards agreed that the referee made an error by blowing the whistle too early. Law 12 states a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand when the ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has been identified as the top style for raising successful children. This approach prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, focusing on creating a safe space for children to express big emotions and show up as their authentic selves. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without rushing to fix them, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as stress signals. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame.</p>
