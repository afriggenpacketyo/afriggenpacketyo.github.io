          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. The company's overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, with strong performance from its Search, YouTube advertising, and Google Cloud segments. However, Alphabet also raised its projected capital expenditure for 2025 by $10 billion to a new total of $85 billion, citing high demand for its Cloud and AI products. This increased spending forecast caused a slight dip in the company's stock during after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ServiceNow reported strong second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, prompting the company to raise its full-year subscription revenue forecast. The enterprise technology firm attributed its success to accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence, with CEO Bill McDermott stating that business processes across all industries are being redesigned for agentic AI. Subscription revenues, the company's main income source, reached $3.11 billion. Despite the positive outlook, the company noted potential uncertainty related to budget changes at U.S. federal government agencies, which represent a significant customer base.

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's projections for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong growth in its software and infrastructure segments. The company's revenue increased by nearly 8% year-over-year, with its hybrid cloud offerings, including Red Hat, showing 16% growth. Despite the positive report, IBM's shares experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. The tech giant maintained its full-year forecast, expecting over $13.5 billion in free cash flow and revenue growth of at least 5% at constant currency for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his House seat in the Hudson Valley. Lawler, who represents a competitive district, stated that maintaining the Republican House majority is critical for the economy. His decision avoids a potential primary contest with Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is also considering a gubernatorial run. Incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul responded to the news by criticizing Lawler, suggesting he lacked the courage to challenge her or former President Trump.</p>

          <p>Elite cyclists competing in the Tour de France are fueled by a carbohydrate revolution that involves consuming thousands of calories daily to sustain their performance. According to Tim Podlogar, a researcher in exercise metabolism, these athletes have meticulously planned nutritional strategies to manage the extreme energy demands of the multi-stage race. The high intake of carbohydrates is essential for replenishing glycogen stores and maintaining energy levels throughout the grueling competition. This scientific approach to nutrition has become a critical component of modern professional cycling, enabling athletes to push their physical limits.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Michael Vaughan has praised the inclusion of veteran spinner Liam Dawson, stating that he makes the Test side stronger. Playing in his first Test match in eight years, the 35-year-old left-armer made an immediate impact by dismissing Indian opener Yashasvi Jaiswal on the first day of the fourth Test. Dawson's recall came after an injury to Shoaib Bashir, and his performance was lauded for providing control and consistency. Vaughan argued that Dawson's all-round package, including his reliable batting, is better suited for England's needs than the raw potential of younger spinners.</p>

Torres, who grew up in public housing, also discussed his pragmatic approach to politics, the need to build more housing, and the bizarre role that foreign policy issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict play in local New York politics.</p>
