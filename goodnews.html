          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ruled her detention unconstitutional, stating it chilled free speech. Ozturk was detained after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration due to her co-authored op-ed criticizing the university's response to resolutions supporting Palestine. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, highlighting her academic commitment and peaceful character. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the visa was revoked due to her pro-Palestinian activism, while the ACLU celebrated her release as a victory for First Amendment rights.

          <p>State regulators have announced that tap water is now safe to drink in all areas served by the nine water systems affected by the Altadena and Pacific Palisades firestorms, lifting all "do not drink" notices. The final utility, Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, was cleared after a four-month advisory period, with recommendations for customers to flush their household systems. The State Water Resources Control Board worked with utilities to assess damage and test for contaminants, particularly benzene, a carcinogen found in plastic and wildfire smoke. The restoration reflects the utilities' efforts and the challenges in rebuilding systems, complicated by limited federal funding. Optimism score is 90.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of state residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022 for unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. The settlement covers allegations in two separate lawsuits related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. Google did not admit any wrongdoing and stated that the settlement involves old claims concerning product policies that have long been changed. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Longtime Cleveland meteorologist Mark Johnson is "no longer employed at WEWS," Channel 5 reported, without providing a reason for his departure. The station's vice president and general manager, Steve Weinstein, stated that News 5 and its parent company, Scripps, take protecting audiences' trust seriously and require employees to adhere to the highest ethical standards. The station will immediately conduct a search for Johnson's replacement, who joined Channel 5 in November 1993 and received Emmy Awards for his weather forecasting.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her continued detention could chill the speech of millions of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, had been held at the immigration detention center in Basile, La., for six weeks. Her lawyers accused the government of detaining her in retaliation for speech that is protected by the First Amendment, specifically an essay critical of Israel that she helped to write in a Tufts student newspaper last year. The judge said there was no evidence that has been introduced by the government other than the Op-Ed. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere by the end of this weekend after 53 years adrift in space. The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and designed with a heat shield, has a chance of surviving its re-entry. While the exact location of re-entry is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. Experts say the risk of injuries on the ground is low, and if any pieces survive, they legally belong to Russia. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates after an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting earlier on Friday and realised it was "spear-phishing" - which impersonates a trusted source. Parents have been sent texts telling that them students' passwords have been reset as a precaution - meaning pupils studying for exams do not currently have access to their school's learning resources.

Earlier this week, Henan province, which grows about a third of China's crop, issued a risk warning as hot, dry weather threatened the wheat growing in its fields. The bookings from Australia were the first made by China from the country since last year. China has in recent years been one of the world's biggest wheat importers. Optimism score is 65.</p>
