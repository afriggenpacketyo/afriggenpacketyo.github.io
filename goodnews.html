          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alphabet can continue its lucrative practice of paying Apple to feature Google Search as the default on its devices, a decision viewed as a significant victory for both tech giants. While the ruling prevents contracts that mandate exclusivity, it allows the core financial arrangement, estimated at $20 billion annually for Apple, to persist. This outcome also opens possibilities for Apple to forge similar paid partnerships with AI companies for services like Siri, potentially adding billions more to its Services division revenue and boosting investor confidence.

          <p>With the average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers at $1,976 in 2025, many retirees find this amount insufficient to cover all their expenses, highlighting the need for supplemental income. The actual benefit amount varies widely based on an individual's work history and the age at which they claim benefits, with payments ranging from around $900 to a maximum of $5,108. To bridge potential income gaps, strategies such as delaying claims to increase monthly payments are recommended. Other options include purchasing annuities to create a predictable income stream or utilizing a reverse mortgage to access home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comcast's NBCUniversal has announced its highest-grossing NFL season to date in terms of advertising revenue and has already sold out all commercial slots for Super Bowl LX in February. This success underscores the continued dominance of live sports, particularly professional football, in attracting massive audiences and advertising dollars for both traditional television and streaming platforms. The company reported strong demand from automotive, insurance, and retail brands for its "Sunday Night Football" programming, with 90% of that inventory already sold. The high demand has pushed the price for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial to a reported $8 million.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members, including Republican Chip Roy and Democrat Seth Magaziner, has introduced legislation to prohibit lawmakers, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The bill aims to address long-standing concerns about potential conflicts of interest and insider trading, requiring members to divest their holdings within 180 days of the law's enactment. The proposal has garnered support from across the ideological spectrum and from key leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump. However, it still faces opposition from some members who argue such a ban would discourage public service.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Governor Waller Advocates for September Interest Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has publicly supported initiating an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September. Waller, considered a potential successor to Jerome Powell as Fed chair, argued that action is needed as the labor market can deteriorate quickly, and he believes current rates are significantly above their neutral level. He suggested that multiple cuts could occur over the next three to six months, providing flexibility to adjust the pace based on incoming economic data, including the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. His stance signals a growing debate within the Fed about the timing of monetary policy easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is ending its Prime Invitee program, a feature that allowed Prime members to share their free shipping benefits with one person outside their household. The program will be phased out on October 1, with Amazon instead encouraging these users to purchase their own subscriptions. To ease the transition, Amazon is offering affected individuals a discounted one-year Prime membership for $14.99. The company is directing users toward its Amazon Family feature, which allows benefit sharing with another adult and children living within the same household, as a replacement for the discontinued program.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong Un's appearance in Beijing alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin marks his first multilateral diplomatic event and signals a strategic effort to revive North Korea's economy. While the joint appearance projects an image of unity against the U.S.-led world order, experts believe Kim's primary goal is to secure economic assistance from China, its largest trading partner. Trade between the two nations remains below pre-pandemic levels, and Pyongyang is feeling the strain. This diplomatic push may also serve as leverage for North Korea in any potential future negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>A Long Island judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, a landmark decision for New York state courts. Prosecutors utilized whole genome sequencing to link hairs found on victims' remains to Heuermann and his family, a method capable of extracting DNA from degraded samples. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the California-based lab that performed the testing is not licensed in New York. This case could set a significant precedent for the use of cutting-edge forensic science in criminal trials across the state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, Henning Otte, has called for the reintroduction of mandatory service for both men and women. His proposal differs from the current government draft, which only requires men to complete a questionnaire about voluntary military service. Otte suggests a compulsory year of service that could be fulfilled not only in the military but also in emergency services, cultural, or volunteer organizations, reflecting a system similar to what Germany abolished in 2011. The debate comes as Germany re-evaluates its defense posture and societal needs in a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers looking to invest $50,000, determining the best Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate requires balancing high interest rates with total earnings over time. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less offer the highest rates, with some 6-month CDs yielding around 4.45%. However, longer-term CDs, despite having slightly lower rates, can generate significantly more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a two-year CD at 4.10% would earn over $4,100, far exceeding the approximate $1,100 earned from a higher-rate six-month CD, making the saver's time horizon a critical factor.
