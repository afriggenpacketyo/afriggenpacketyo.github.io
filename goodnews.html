          <p>Princeton, Texas, has been identified as the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population surging from 17,000 to 37,000 in just a few years. The rapid expansion is driven by affordable housing compared to the nearby Dallas area, attracting many first-time homeowners. However, this explosive growth has created significant challenges, forcing the city to pause construction to upgrade essential infrastructure like sewer lines, water systems, and roads. City officials acknowledge they are about five years behind in development and are now racing to manage the growth, with the population projected to reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>Actress Winona Ryder recently shared some personal stories about her admiration for fellow actors earlier in her career. She revealed that she was so captivated by Christopher Walken that she kept the wishbone from a rotisserie chicken he once gave her, with plans to turn it into a necklace. Ryder also recalled being "actively in love" with Al Pacino during her early twenties while working with him, even directly confessing her feelings to him. Now happily with her partner Scott Mackinlay Hahn, the article portrays these past infatuations as charming and humorous memories from her life in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis legend Venus Williams was defeated by Magdalena Frech in the second round of the DC Open, ending her bid for a first back-to-back tour victory since 2019.

Despite the loss, Williams received a standing ovation from the crowd, acknowledging her enduring impact and powerful performance.

          <p>The Washington, D.C. city council has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders for a new stadium at the RFK site, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block it. The President had demanded the team revert to its former "Redskins" name as a condition for his support, a comment the D.C. Council chairman described as an unhelpful distraction. The agreement, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, still faces a council vote and challenges related to the transfer of the federally-owned land. However, the move signals strong local political will to bring the NFL team back to the district after 30 years in Maryland.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read a handwritten address, the mail is not returned to sender but is digitally rerouted to a unique facility in Salt Lake City. This Remote Encoding Center employs hundreds of "keyers," experts who decipher poor penmanship, processing images of around one billion pieces of mail annually. These specialists work around the clock to quickly identify the correct destination for hard-to-read letters and packages, ensuring they reach their intended recipients. If the keyers are also stumped, the physical mail is then manually inspected as a final effort to solve the puzzle of the illegible address.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the open U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina for the 2026 election. His expected candidacy has reportedly received an endorsement from President Trump, following Lara Trump's announcement that she would not seek the seat. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his candidacy for the same position, which is being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis. This sets the stage for a high-profile and competitive battleground contest in one of the key races of the upcoming cycle.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while in full mascot costume on charges of debit card theft. Police were alerted by a customer who, after noticing fraudulent charges, conducted her own investigation and identified the suspect from security footage at a store where her card was used. Officers confronted the man, Jermel Jarreau Jones, during his shift as the mouse mascot, leading to a surreal scene where "Chuck E." was handcuffed and escorted from the family restaurant. The stolen debit card was allegedly found in his pocket after police removed the oversized mascot head.</p>

Watson, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, has been working with a team nutritionist to manage his weight.

Archbishop José Gomez stated that many "good, hard-working" people are now living in fear of arrest and deportation. The Family Assistance Program will leverage existing parish networks, many of which were developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, to serve vulnerable members of the community.

          <p>The 2028 Democratic presidential primary appears to be unofficially underway, with several potential candidates making strategic media appearances on a variety of platforms, including non-traditional and conservative-leaning podcasts. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are using these opportunities to define their public personas and signal a potential shift toward the political center. This includes addressing sensitive cultural topics, such as gender identity, more directly than the party has in the past. This early activity is seen as a course correction following the 2024 election loss, aiming to broaden the party's appeal and find a new standard-bearer.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are not over-investing in artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and increased capital expenditure is essential for securing a market-leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased spending on cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and necessary to build the most accurate and profitable AI services. He believes the company that wins the AI race could achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive financial outlays. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With regulators like the U.S. FDA phasing out artificial food colorings such as Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are racing to develop stable and vibrant natural alternatives.

The challenge lies in creating natural colors that are as vivid and have a similar shelf life as their synthetic counterparts, without significantly increasing costs. This shift is prompting major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé to reformulate iconic products to meet new health standards and consumer expectations.</p>
