          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is forecast to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean, posing no immediate threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Positioned about 635 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, the storm is moving northeast and is expected to transition into a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating by Thursday. This event marks Fernand as the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which also remained at sea. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which were expected to become hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Two construction workers in China's Shaanxi province found themselves trapped precariously mid-air on a suspended gondola when a sudden and severe rainstorm struck the region. The harrowing incident saw the individuals stranded for approximately 20 minutes, hanging high above the ground amidst the storm. Fortunately, a swift and effective rescue operation was mounted, leading to their safe retrieval and preventing a potentially tragic outcome. This event underscores the inherent risks faced by construction personnel, particularly when confronted with unpredictable and extreme weather conditions in bustling urban environments, and highlights the crucial importance of rapid emergency response protocols in such situations.</p>

          <p>Former England and Team GB rugby player Heather Fisher candidly shares her decade-long struggle with alopecia, an autoimmune condition that caused her hair loss following a serious back injury in 2010. She recounts the profound emotional toll, the challenge of accepting her changed identity, and the discrimination she faced, including being mistaken for a man and experiencing physical harassment. Fisher, a 2014 World Cup winner and Olympian, now reflects on how the sporting world has evolved to be more inclusive, partly due to social media. She hopes to inspire others by openly sharing her story, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>

          <h2>Congressional Budget Office Report Sparks Debate on Effectiveness of Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 05:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report suggests President Trump’s tariffs could significantly reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and total deficits by $4.0 trillion over the 2025-2035 period if they persist. This "stunning" finding has prompted debate among free-market economists, many of whom traditionally view tariffs as taxes that ultimately harm incomes and compound economic damage. The article highlights how some, like Dr. Richard McKenzie, acknowledge that the *threat* of tariffs could be used to lower those of other nations. Furthermore, it addresses the significant legal question of the President's executive authority to impose such sweeping edicts, a constitutional matter currently under review and likely destined for the Supreme Court.

          <p>China has successfully launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, establishing it as the world’s largest detector for the elusive "ghost particles" known as neutrinos. This massive facility has commenced data collection, with its core being a 20,000-ton liquid scintillator detector housed within a giant acrylic sphere 35 meters in diameter, located 700 meters below ground. Juno's primary mission is to precisely measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by two nuclear power plants situated 53 kilometers away. Particle physicist Wang Yifang hailed the completion and data-taking as a "historic milestone" for this international project, initially proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, Catherine Hamel's high school ID, lost during the storm, was miraculously found and returned to her. Wildlife Biologist Becky Copeland discovered the 50-year-old ID on Horn Island, 55 miles east of Hamel's former home, but could only decipher the name after the plastic inexplicably lightened with time. Hamel, who lost nearly everything in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi, when the storm hit, expressed profound shock and emotion at recovering a tangible memento from the first 50 years of her life. This poignant story highlights the enduring impact of the 2005 disaster and the unexpected ways lost personal history can resurface, offering a small piece of closure.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot expressed frustration with Newcastle United's defensive tactics during his side's breathless 3-2 victory, stating he wasn't "too sure he saw a football match." The game, which saw Liverpool's 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha score a 100th-minute winner, was characterized by frequent stoppages and a ball-in-play percentage of just 40.8%—the lowest in the Premier League since 2010. Slot criticized Newcastle's reliance on set-pieces and long throws, especially after Anthony Gordon received a red card. The feisty match, marked by 32 fouls and underlying transfer rumors, proved a difficult but ultimately successful test of resilience for Liverpool, who "stood strong" despite the challenging conditions.</p>

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign urging passengers to use headphones or hands-free kits when using mobile phones on public transport, specifically targeting "disruptive behaviour" like playing music or making calls on loudspeakers. TfL research found that 70% of passengers consider such noise a nuisance, with some finding it very stressful, particularly individuals with heightened sensitivity like those with autism. Posters will appear on the Elizabeth line from Tuesday and across other services from the autumn, accompanied by Instagram posts. The initiative comes as 4G and 5G coverage expands across large sections of the Tube network, which is believed to have increased mobile device usage and associated noise.</p>

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its carbon market to include major industries by 2027, three years ahead of its original schedule, according to new guidelines from top policymakers. The plan also mandates setting absolute limits on emissions, a significantly tougher standard compared to the current system that bases caps on carbon intensity. This ambitious move underscores China's determination to meet its climate targets and is expected to invigorate its often sluggish carbon market by spurring demand. The initial expansion this year will incorporate three heavily polluting industries—steel, aluminum, and cement—though they will be subject to less stringent rules during their first two years of inclusion.</p>

          <p>Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is in a significant quandary over whether to play in next month's tournament, a decision he describes as "the biggest of my life." Historically, there hasn't been a playing captain since 1963, and combining the roles is seen by many as nonsensical due to extensive captaincy duties. While Bradley is ranked 11th globally and eighth among Americans, having recently shown strong form, there's debate over whether his participation would be self-indulgent or a valuable asset to the team. The article explores arguments for and against him playing, noting the potential for criticism if the US loses, regardless of his choice, and considering the influence of players who want him to tee up.</p>

This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is crucial for a faster launch cadence and for testing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a requirement for NASA's planned moon landing by 2027 and eventual Mars flights. SpaceX founder Elon Musk emphasizes perfecting orbital refueling as key to building a city on Mars. While challenges remain, NASA's acting administrator expressed optimism, citing SpaceX's rapid iteration and impressive record with its Falcon rockets, despite skepticism from some experts about the 2027 moon landing timeline.</p>

Trump expressed a desire for the US to "get along good" with China and mentioned a recent conversation with President Xi, hinting at a potential visit to China later this year or shortly thereafter.
