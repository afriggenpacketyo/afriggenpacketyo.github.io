          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. While stating that "there’s no deal until there’s a deal," Trump indicated significant progress was made and that he believes Putin is genuinely open to achieving peace. He declined to specify the remaining sticking points but suggested the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European nations, also noting he would be open to a future trilateral meeting.</p>

          <p>Following a legal challenge from Washington D.C. officials, the Trump administration has rescinded an order that would have replaced the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, with a federal appointee. After an emergency court hearing, the Justice Department agreed to a compromise where Chief Smith retains full command of the Metropolitan Police Department. The revised directive now positions the federal official as an intermediary for directing police services for federal purposes, such as immigration enforcement, resolving a tense standoff over control of the capital's law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designed to be sold separately from the main property, a new step in addressing the state's housing crisis. This development follows a local ordinance passed last year allowing ADUs, or 'granny flats,' to be treated as condominiums, creating a new form of affordable homeownership. As ADU construction booms across the state, accounting for a significant portion of new housing, this initiative could serve as a model for other cities seeking to create more accessible starter homes.</p>

The agreement was initiated as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, who admired Gabriel's vitality. Although Gabriel's declining health prevented him from traveling, he fulfilled his commitment by conducting the band remotely from his home in Virginia, demonstrating his belief that one's word is their bond.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that since pollution sources are so diverse—including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads—efforts should pivot from source control to protecting residents with indoor air filtration and public health alerts.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, suggesting the fruit may actually improve metabolic health when consumed in moderation. Two recent clinical trials found that replacing carbohydrates like white bread with a controlled portion of mango led to better blood sugar regulation, lower insulin resistance, and other positive health markers in adults with type 2 diabetes. While experts emphasize that portion control is crucial, the findings offer a hopeful perspective for managing the condition without completely eliminating the beloved fruit.</p>

The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while each of the restaurant chain's locations has a Kobe mural, this one was adapted to fit the Dodgers theme, creating a piece that has generated both positive reactions and lively debate among fans.</p>

The proposal, similar to a system already in place in Scotland, aims to help young people access work and education opportunities more easily. Young people interviewed by the BBC expressed that the current high cost of bus fares significantly impacts their budgets, forcing them to cut back on socializing and food, and making it difficult to save money or live independently.</p>

However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's final price may be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment and testing whether its minimalist appeal can succeed without a sub-$20,000 price tag.
