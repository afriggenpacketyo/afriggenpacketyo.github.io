          <p>Reese Hogan, a California high school track athlete, briefly posed on the first-place podium after finishing second to a transgender athlete in the triple jump at the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section Finals. Hogan, who achieved a personal and school record, was praised on social media for her gesture, with many considering her the "real champion." This event occurred after Hogan and other athletes were allegedly told by CIF officials to remove their "Protect Girls Sports" T-shirts before a previous meet. The Trump administration has since put California and Governor Gavin Newsom on notice regarding the inclusion of biological males in girls' and women's sports, leading to a Title IX investigation of the CIF.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, the cells forming the basis of complex life, existed around 2.72 billion years ago and metabolized hydrogen rather than oxygen. This finding challenges previous understandings of the lineage of this ancestor and supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells. The research, published in Nature, indicates that this ancestor lived under oxygen-deficient conditions, before the Great Oxidation Event. Understanding eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life beyond Earth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working to conserve jaguars by changing perceptions and incentivizing ranchers to protect the wild cats. Through the Viviendo con Felinos program, ranchers are paid for motion camera photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats on their land, turning the animals into a source of income rather than a threat to livestock. This approach has led to a cultural shift, with ranchers increasingly valuing jaguars and protecting their habitat. The success of this program is crucial for the potential reestablishment of jaguars in the American Southwest, as it depends on a healthy population in northern Mexico.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, McPhail, stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. More than half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports to reduce reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement of potential price increases due to tariffs. Home Depot's first-quarter earnings missed expectations, but sales beat estimates, and the company maintained its full-year sales forecast, assuming the continuation of temporary tariff reductions on imports from China and other countries.</p>

The legislation is inspired by Ms. Ghasemzadeh's deportation to Panama before she could seek asylum, and seeks to uphold laws that the Trump administration has ignored in its deportations.

          <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is urging doctors to improve pain management for in-office gynecological procedures, such as IUD insertions and cervical biopsies. ACOG's new recommendations emphasize the need for thorough conversations with patients about potential pain and offering options like paracervical blocks and lidocaine. The guidelines aim to address inequalities in pain treatment and improve patient experiences, following a wave of social media advocacy highlighting negative experiences at OBGYN clinics. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the importance of patient autonomy and transparency in gynecological care.</p>
