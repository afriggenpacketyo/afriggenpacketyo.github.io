          <p>Germany's coalition government is at odds over how to expand the Bundeswehr to meet NATO requirements. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the SPD is pushing for a more attractive voluntary service model, hoping to draw enough recruits with better pay and training. However, members of the center-right CDU/CSU coalition partners are skeptical, arguing that relying on volunteers is insufficient given the current security climate and are pushing for a faster return to compulsory service. The debate highlights a fundamental disagreement on national security policy within the German government.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old California man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days while canyoneering. While rappelling down the Seven Teacups on the Kern River, he was pushed off his lines by extreme hydraulics and became stranded in a cave behind the water. A search operation involving a drone located him, and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew hoisted him to safety. Wardwell sustained only minor injuries and was treated for dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

The airline is working to stabilize its schedule but warns that some cancellations may persist for up to 10 days. The core of the dispute remains unresolved issues over pay and unpaid work.</p>

          <p>A unique program organized by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas is helping elderly parents obtain temporary U.S. visas to reunite with their undocumented children, some of whom they haven't seen in decades. The article highlights the emotional reunion of José Antonio Rodríguez and his parents, who had been separated for nearly 25 years since he left for California. The program offers a rare opportunity for families separated by immigration status to reconnect, though the number of visas approved by the U.S. remains limited, reflecting the challenging immigration landscape.</p>

          <p>The neighborhood north of Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C., rebranded as "NoMa," has transformed from an ex-industrial zone into a thriving example of pro-housing, or "YIMBY" (Yes In My Back Yard), development. The area, once known as "Swampoodle," was redeveloped starting in the 1990s with a focus on increasing housing density and creating a modern, attractive urban environment. This transformation serves as a case study in urban renewal and the successful implementation of policies aimed at alleviating housing shortages by encouraging new construction and development in city centers.</p>

The film portrays a world where romantic compatibility is assessed like a market analysis, reflecting a cultural shift influenced by dating apps and economic pressures. This article argues that the movie accurately captures how wealth inequality and the high cost of living have made financial stability a primary consideration in forming partnerships. It suggests that the blending of love and finance is an uncomfortable but realistic reflection of contemporary relationships.</p>

          <p>A recent market trend, where the S&P 500 closed above its 20-day moving average for 68 consecutive days, has occurred only eight other times since 1957. Historical data analysis shows that in seven of those eight instances, the index saw an average gain of 11% over the following 12 months. While this pattern suggests a bullish outlook, potential headwinds from tariff negotiations and persistent inflation could still introduce market volatility. The analysis highlights a rare statistical occurrence that has historically preceded strong market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on how life events transformed her perception of Renaissance art from something cold and academic into a source of deep emotional resonance. Initially dismissive of religious paintings as a student, she found new meaning in the works of masters like Caravaggio and Piero della Francesca after experiencing trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The article explores how personal growth and lived experiences can unlock a deeper understanding and appreciation for art, allowing one to connect with the profound human emotions depicted in historical masterpieces.</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the notorious "canal killer" responsible for two murders in the early 1990s, through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. A cold case detective, posing as if to clear Miller as a suspect, met him for a meal with the sole purpose of covertly collecting his DNA from a water glass. Eleven days later, forensic analysis confirmed a match with DNA found on the victims, Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller, who was known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, was subsequently arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>
