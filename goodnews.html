          <p>A recent survey indicates that nearly 60% of American adults are prioritizing paying down credit card debt, which collectively exceeds $1.21 trillion amidst interest rates around 22%. The article details several strategic approaches for managing and reducing this debt, especially for those with multiple balances. Methods discussed include debt forgiveness through settlement, debt management plans via credit counseling, issuer hardship programs, and debt consolidation using loans or balance transfer cards. These options aim to simplify payments and lower interest costs, providing a pathway toward financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Sheridan, the creator of "Yellowstone," is partnering with Paramount and real estate developer Hillwood to open a large-scale film studio in Fort Worth, Texas. The 450,000-square-foot production campus will be the largest in the state and is expected to become the base for Sheridan's shows like "Landman" and "Lioness." This development aligns with Texas's recent initiative to boost its film industry by increasing its film incentives program to $1.5 billion over the next decade.

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive and opinionated ranking of the film and television adaptations of John Grisham's legal thrillers. It evaluates nine different productions, from the 1993 movie "The Pelican Brief" to the new 2025 TV series "The Rainmaker," based on their quality and faithfulness to Grisham's characteristic themes of underdog protagonists fighting against powerful, corrupt entities. The list critiques each adaptation's plot, casting, and overall execution, ultimately naming "The Pelican Brief" as the best and the 2012 TV version of "The Firm" as the worst.</p>

Other prominent investors, including Michael Burry and David Tepper, also disclosed significant positions.

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has been detected in the Geysers geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The seismic activity is believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, where steam is withdrawn and cold water is injected deep underground. This process alters pressure and temperature, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift, resulting in frequent minor tremors.</p>

          <p>The UK supermarket chain Iceland is introducing a new initiative to combat rising retail theft by offering customers a £1 credit for reporting shoplifting incidents to staff. The company's executive chairman stated that shoplifting costs the business approximately £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in employees. The move comes as police-recorded shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest level in over two decades. Iceland has clarified that customers should not confront suspected thieves but should alert a staff member to be eligible for the reward.</p>

          <p>Despite economic challenges in Europe and China, U.S. shoppers continue to drive strong sales in the jewelry market. Danish brand Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, highlighting America as a key growth market that accounts for a third of its revenue. This trend is also visible at the luxury end, with Cartier-owner Richemont posting a 17% jump in American sales. However, jewelry brands face headwinds from potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising costs of materials like silver and gold, which could eventually impact the robust consumer demand currently seen in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new Zillow analysis shows that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. is now $1.4 million, there are still a few metropolitan areas where large homes can be purchased for less than $1 million. Cities like Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee, offer mansions (defined as homes with at least 5,000 square feet) with median values below this threshold. This contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion costs $6.5 million. The report highlights the growing cost of high-end real estate, as only three in ten mansions nationally are now valued under $1 million, compared to nearly half in 2021.</p>

          <p>Krish Kandiah, head of the Sanctuary Foundation charity, has offered an "olive branch" to UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick after accusing him of "xenophobia" on a BBC radio segment. The comment, which the BBC later apologized for and edited out, was in response to Jenrick's remarks about not wanting his children to live near "men from backward countries." Kandiah has now called for collaboration to de-escalate fear and focus on real issues like housing and the cost of living, rather than anti-immigrant sentiment.
