          <p>GE Vernova announced a $41 million investment to expand its generator manufacturing operations in Schenectady, New York, aiming to increase its gas power capacity. This move is a response to the unprecedented demand for its heavy-duty gas turbines, largely driven by the energy needs of new AI data centers. The company's gas turbines are reportedly sold out for 2026 and 2027, creating a significant order backlog. While this investment focuses on generators, which are crucial components that work with turbines, it is seen as a key step to prevent further supply chain bottlenecks and support the overall gas power business.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a state law that would have required all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, set to take effect September 1, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. The lawsuit was filed by several families and civil liberties groups, who argued the mandate constituted unconstitutional religious coercion of students. In his decision, the judge stated the displays would likely pressure students into religious observance and suppress their own beliefs.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent cooling from peak rates, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) continue to offer attractive returns for savers, with top rates often exceeding 4%. This article breaks down the potential earnings on a $125,000 investment across various CD terms, from three months to five years. For example, a one-year CD at 4.30% could generate approximately $5,375 in interest, while a five-year CD at 4.20% could yield around $28,550. CDs provide predictable, guaranteed returns, making them a compelling option for conservative investors in a volatile economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, announced that the company achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, with annual recurring revenue now at $10 billion. Despite this rapid growth, Friar emphasized that the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for GPUs to power its AI models. This high demand is the driving force behind major infrastructure projects like Stargate and partnerships with Oracle and Coreweave to diversify its computing resources. CEO Sam Altman recently stated that the company expects to spend trillions on datacenters to meet future training and operational needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists led by the University of Oxford has developed a nutritional supplement, described as a "superfood," designed to protect honeybees from threats like climate change and habitat loss. The breakthrough involves a specially engineered yeast that produces all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, particularly lipids called sterols, which were previously difficult to manufacture. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement had up to 15 times more offspring that grew to adulthood. This development could help beekeepers sustain their colonies when natural pollen is scarce, which is crucial for global crop pollination.</p>

After several years of grade adjustments following the COVID-19 pandemic, the pass rate is expected to be similar to 2024 levels. However, education experts warn that students may face increased competition for places at popular sixth form colleges due to a larger population of 16-year-olds and growing demand. This cohort of students began secondary school under pandemic restrictions, adding a unique context to their educational journey as they await their crucial grades.</p>

The marketing push is designed to reach consumers who have cut the cord, a trend that has eroded ESPN's subscriber base. Existing pay-TV customers can access the app at no extra cost, and the campaign includes partnerships with Lyft, Walmart, and Samsung to maximize visibility and attract new subscribers.</p>

          <p>France, Britain, Canada, Australia, and Malta have announced they are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine, potentially at the upcoming UN General Assembly. This move is seen as a significant diplomatic step to bolster the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution over the armed struggle of its rival, Hamas. The recognition aims to counter Israeli expansionist policies in the West Bank and address the long-standing asymmetry in international recognition of Jewish and Palestinian national rights. It sends a clear message to Israel to end the war in Gaza and cease settlement expansion.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage in the survey's nearly 90-year history. The decline coincides with a growing belief that even moderate drinking is unhealthy, with a record 53% of adults now viewing it as bad for their health, a significant increase from 28% in 2015. This shift in perception is most pronounced among young adults but is also growing among older demographics. The findings suggest that public health messages about the risks of alcohol, including its link to cancer, are influencing American drinking habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) could see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated interest rate cuts in the coming months. Unlike fixed-rate mortgages, HELOCs have variable rates often tied to the prime rate, which typically moves in tandem with the Fed's adjustments. A rate cut could provide immediate or eventual relief, though the timing depends on the lender's specific adjustment schedule and the borrower's billing cycle. Experts advise borrowers to understand their loan terms, including any rate floors, and to budget for potential rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>
