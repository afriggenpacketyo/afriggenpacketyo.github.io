          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that future interest rate cuts might be warranted, though the Fed plans to proceed cautiously amidst high economic uncertainty. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell noted shifting risks between full employment and stable prices, citing policy changes in tax, trade, and immigration. While the labor market remains strong, downside dangers are rising, and tariffs pose inflation risks. Powell emphasized the Fed's independence, stating decisions are based solely on data and economic outlook, not political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke lost his libel case against The Guardian, which had published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, finding the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment concluded that the meaning of the articles was "substantially true" and that Clarke was "not a credible or reliable witness." Over a dozen women testified during the trial, and the judge rejected Clarke's claim of an "unlawful conspiracy" against him.</p>

China has made significant recent advancements, including successful tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and Long March-10 rocket. While NASA's Artemis program targets a 2027 lunar return, its lander choices face development hurdles. Experts suggest China could potentially surpass the US due to NASA's delays and budget issues, highlighting China's rapid technological development and demonstrated mission capacity.

          <p>Texas Instruments is undertaking a $60 billion manufacturing megaproject in the U.S., including new fabs in Utah and Texas, to produce foundational microchips. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company will make critical semiconductors for iPhones at these facilities, increasing Apple's U.S. spending commitment. While TI's shares initially dropped due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts see the U.S. foundry as a long-term advantage, allowing TI to potentially undercut rivals. The project, aiming for five times current capacity, is a significant bet on domestic chip production and regional economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>John Deere is navigating a challenging period marked by decreasing demand in the agricultural sector, yet simultaneously committing to significant U.S. manufacturing investments. The company reported lower net income and sales due to farmers reducing spending amidst falling crop prices and rising costs. Despite recent layoffs, Deere plans to invest $20 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, buoyed by growth in European and South American markets and anticipated positive trade and tax policies. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term cyclical recovery, particularly in precision agriculture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are mitigating the impact of President Trump's tariffs, preventing widespread price hikes for consumers, at least for now. Companies are diversifying sourcing, pushing costs back to vendors, and importing goods early to blunt the effects. While consumer spending remains steady overall, lower-income households are more sensitive to price adjustments. Despite strategic efforts, tariff costs are still rising for retailers, and the ongoing trade uncertainty, particularly with China, continues to influence business strategies and earnings outlooks.

          <p>As the U.S. retreats from clean energy investment under President Trump's administration, Chinese "cleantech" firms are aggressively expanding into emerging markets across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America. Chinese investors show renewed interest in local start-ups, embedding proprietary technologies into supply chains and promoting their technical standards, particularly in solar, batteries, and electric vehicles. This "tech diplomacy" aims to align regional energy systems with Chinese intellectual property ecosystems, contrasting with Trump's stance against wind and solar projects due to perceived cost increases.
