        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike's stock experienced a decline of approximately 5% in extended trading on Tuesday following the company's release of a revenue forecast that fell short of expectations. While the company's earnings per share exceeded estimates at 73 cents adjusted versus the expected 65 cents, revenue matched expectations at $1.10 billion. Despite a nearly 20% increase in revenue for the fiscal first quarter, the company reported a net loss of $110.2 million, a stark contrast to the net income of $42.8 million in the same quarter of the previous year, which was attributed to rising costs in sales, marketing, research, and development. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program to reflect confidence in CrowdStrike's future and mission of stopping breaches. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization on Tuesday, reclaiming its position as the world's most valuable publicly traded company for the first time since January. Shares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker surged by approximately 3% to $141.40, reflecting a nearly 24% increase over the past month, driven by sustained growth despite export control and tariff concerns. The company's market cap reached $3.45 trillion, slightly exceeding Microsoft's $3.44 trillion. The resurgence of Nvidia and other chip manufacturers bolstered markets, with Broadcom rising 3% and Micron Technology gaining 4%.</p>

          <p>Wales head coach Rhian Wilkinson emphasized the importance of learning from the team's recent defeat by Italy in the Nations League. Wilkinson likened the first half of the game to "a punch in the face" and expressed disappointment with the team's performance. Despite the heavy defeat, Wilkinson highlighted the improved second-half performance as indicative of the Welsh team's potential. She believes the loss will serve as an important moment for the team's development as they prepare for the upcoming European Championships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been spared from President Donald Trump's executive order that doubled steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, but the levy remains at 25% for the UK. This exemption is contingent on the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8, with a potential increase to 50% if the UK does not comply with the terms of the EPD by July 9. The UK government has affirmed its commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has announced the removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, which was a punishment for past misconduct, including the cross-selling scandal. This restriction had prevented Wells Fargo from growing key lines of its business for years, but now the firm can increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division. Wells Fargo shares are up more than 2% in after-hours trading. While some of the stock gains in recent months reflect the market pricing in the eventual removal of the asset cap, the Club believes there is plenty more upside that can be realized from here.

Her doctor at Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles stated that she could die within days if she lost access to medical care for short bowel syndrome. Following public outcry and advocacy from lawmakers, the Department of Homeland Security reinstated her humanitarian parole for one year.</p>
