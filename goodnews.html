          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham displayed her camaraderie with teammates Caitlin Clark and Lexie Hull by wearing a shirt featuring the three players with the words "Tres Leches." Cunningham's popularity has grown recently after defending Clark on the court, calling out the WNBA referees for not protecting Clark. She got into an altercation with Jacy Sheldon after Sheldon poked Clark in the eye, which led to a skirmish, resulting in ejections for Cunningham, Sheldon, and Lindsay Allen. Cunningham's social media following has significantly increased as a result of her support for her teammates, and she also holds a black belt in Taekwondo, demonstrating her capabilities as an enforcer.</p>

          <p>The article explores the debate surrounding the safety of moderate alcohol consumption, noting that while heavy drinking is widely recognized as dangerous, the health effects of small amounts are still debated. Public health experts emphasize that moderate drinking is often misunderstood, with many people underestimating the amount of alcohol they consume. While some studies suggest potential cardiovascular benefits from very modest alcohol consumption, doctors generally advise against starting to drink for health reasons. The key takeaways are that heavy drinking is dangerous and it's easy to drink too much, but light drinking is generally not a significant health concern.</p>

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms for the first time since March, reaching 3,920 yen, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributed the drop to the release of additional rice reserves, indicating the government's efforts to lower prices are proving effective. The market share of blended rice, including reserve rice, has increased, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to bring the average retail price down to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June. Despite the recent fall, rice prices remain nearly double what they were a year earlier.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis (TB) screening for foreign nationals planning to stay over three months, beginning with those from the Philippines and Nepal. The decision is driven by the increasing number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, primarily from these countries. Individuals must provide evidence of being TB-free before arrival or face denial of entry. This measure aims to prevent the spread of TB, which remains a global health concern despite being curable and preventable, and aligns with Japan's efforts to maintain its low TB incidence rate.</p>

          <p>The government has outlined a 10-year industrial strategy to lower energy costs for thousands of businesses by exempting them from some green energy levies. The measures, which could cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, are intended to boost growth and stabilize the UK economy. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms. The strategy also includes plans to improve worker skills, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending, focusing on eight key sectors.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions have requested that Rugby Australia release its star players for the Super Rugby sides during the tourists' pre-Test series matches. The Lions are concerned that Australia's head coach is keeping key players in camp to protect them from injury, which would diminish the competitiveness of the matches. The agreement stipulates that Test players should be released for fixtures leading up to the series, ensuring that the Lions are adequately prepared for the Test matches. The Lions will play matches against several Australian teams before the first Test in Brisbane.</p>

          <p>Tesla's robotaxi service has launched in Austin, Texas, with a small group of invited participants experiencing paid rides in vehicles with human safety operators. Analysts described the launch as "low-key" but highlighted Tesla's ambition to compete with existing self-driving taxi operators in the US and China. The service currently uses existing Tesla vehicles with a "robotaxi" logo, rather than the futuristic Cybercab concept. Tesla is betting that its volume of cars, data, and cheaper, camera-based self-driving tech will allow it to pull ahead of rivals, though the success depends on improvements to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system.</p>

Some areas in eastern England may experience another heatwave by the end of the week.
