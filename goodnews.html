          <p>Paula Kerger, the CEO of PBS, addresses the ongoing battles over the public broadcaster's funding, noting that recent threats feel like an "all-out effort" to undermine the organization. She discusses the challenges posed by potential budget cuts, including the impact on local stations, particularly those in rural areas that heavily rely on federal funding. Kerger emphasizes PBS's role as a collective investment by the country and highlights its unique position as a parent's partner, especially in children's programming. She also touches on the potential for artificial intelligence to play a role in PBS's future, particularly in education, and shares personal anecdotes about her family's history in public broadcasting.

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek help to end their lives, with health workers allowed to opt out of the process. Amendments under consideration include preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with patients first. The bill has split Parliament, with supporters emphasizing individual autonomy and opponents raising concerns about vulnerable individuals. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs a free vote based on their conscience. Optimism score is set at 60.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill. This measure is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a concept previously supported by President Trump. The deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over and would be phased out for higher-income individuals. While the deduction would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is not as generous as a tax credit. Optimism score is set at 60.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz describes the arduous, nearly four-year path to listing crypto firm Galaxy Digital on the Nasdaq, costing over $25 million. He cites nine rounds of comments with the SEC, describing the process as "unfair, infuriating". Novogratz expects auditing costs, previously inflated due to regulatory scrutiny, to decrease by up to 40% now that Galaxy is publicly traded. Despite the challenges, Novogratz emphasizes the company's resilience, having funded operations primarily through investment gains and trading. Optimism score is set at 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving a 100% 'Made in the USA' vehicle is complicated and potentially unaffordable, experts say, due to the global nature of the automotive supply chain. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase U.S. production, sourcing all parts domestically is challenging. Many parts are cheaper to manufacture overseas, and the U.S. lacks sufficient processing plants for materials like steel and semiconductors. A fully U.S.-made vehicle could significantly increase prices, potentially reducing demand. Optimism score is set at 55.</p>
