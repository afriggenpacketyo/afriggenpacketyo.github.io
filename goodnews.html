          <h2>Analysis Shows Delta and United Airlines Gaining Dominance in the US Airline Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:25:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly outperforming their competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong brand loyalty, extensive networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel and international routes, which helps them navigate market challenges like falling domestic airfares. While other carriers struggle with overcapacity and price sensitivity in the coach class market, Delta and United are leveraging their premium cabins and loyalty programs to maintain profitability. This trend suggests a growing consolidation of market power between these two major carriers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of ether and shares of crypto-adjacent companies like Coinbase and Robinhood surged following the passage of the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to regulate stablecoins. The legislation, now heading to the president's desk, is the first major crypto-focused law in the U.S. and is seen as a significant symbolic victory for the industry. While Bitcoin's price saw a slight dip, ether has rallied strongly, with its associated ETFs seeing record inflows, signaling a potential shift in crypto market leadership. This legislative clarity is expected to embed stablecoins more deeply into the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Consumer Inflation Expectations Fall to Pre-Tariff Levels, University of Michigan Survey Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:14:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers for July indicates a significant drop in inflation expectations, with both one-year and five-year outlooks falling to their lowest levels since February, before recent tariff announcements. The one-year forecast decreased to 4.4% from 5%, while the five-year outlook slid to 3.6%. Despite this improvement, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as the figures remain above pre-2025 levels. The data suggests consumers believe tariff-related inflation will be temporary, an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The last of four detainees who escaped from the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, has been captured in Los Angeles. Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon, a 25-year-old Colombian national, was arrested during a traffic stop, concluding a month-long search. The four men, described by DHS as "public safety threats," reportedly escaped by breaking through a drywall-and-mesh wall in their unit. The escape had followed reports of unrest at the privately-owned facility, though authorities disputed claims of a widespread disturbance. Mogollon now faces federal charges for his escape.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining access to significant oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce tribunal ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the Stabroek Block oil development. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it affirms the industry practice that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The resolution removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal has completed the signing of 23-year-old England winger Noni Madueke from their London rival, Chelsea, for an initial fee of £48.5 million, which could rise to over £50 million. Madueke has signed a five-year contract with the club, becoming Arsenal's fourth major signing of the summer. The move is intended to bolster Arsenal's attack, providing more directness and goal-scoring threat, areas where the team was seen as lacking last season. Despite some initial backlash from a section of fans, the signing is viewed as a significant addition to the squad.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have dropped their criminal investigation into the Irish language rap group Kneecap following their controversial performance at the Glastonbury festival. The investigation was launched over on-stage comments, including a call to "start a riot" in relation to a band member's upcoming court case. The Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The band, which has faced scrutiny for its pro-Palestinian stance, criticized the investigation as "political policing intimidation," while police inquiries into another band, Bob Vylan, are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for helping discover the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the centuries-old mystery of the two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. Contrary to the popular narrative that they were murdered by their uncle, Richard III, Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting both princes survived. The research, detailed in a new book, argues that the story of their murder was Tudor propaganda. While some historians remain skeptical, Langley asserts the burden of proof now lies with those who claim the princes died.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can serve as a financial tool to supplement Social Security benefits. The article outlines three primary ways this can work: by converting home equity into a steady monthly income stream to cover daily expenses, by providing access to a lump sum or line of credit for unexpected costs like healthcare, or by enabling a homeowner to delay claiming Social Security to allow their future benefits to grow. This strategy allows homeowners aged 62 and older to utilize their home's value without having to move. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision included in President Trump's new legislative package has created uncertainty for workers and tax professionals. The measure is not a full tax elimination but a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, available from 2025 through 2028. However, key details remain unclear, as the IRS must still issue guidance on which specific occupations qualify for the break. Questions also persist about how the deduction will work for workers who receive cash tips or don't meet new, higher income reporting thresholds for forms like the 1099-K. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival's program is themed around global crises, with a strong focus on power, conflict, and crumbling regimes. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a selection of operas and plays that explore brutal rivalries, from Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto" to a play based on Karl Kraus's World War I epic, "The Last Days of Mankind." The festival aims to use these historical and fictional struggles as a mirror for contemporary events, providing audiences with "spaces of change." The program also features a strong showing of Russian artists who have distanced themselves from the current regime.</p>
