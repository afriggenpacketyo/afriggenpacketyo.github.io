          <p>Japan is considering expanding the scope of industries eligible for the Specified Skilled Worker visa to address a severe labor shortage, according to a draft presented to a Liberal Democratic Party committee. The draft proposes increasing eligible industries from 16 to 19, newly including warehouse management, waste disposal, and linen supply. The Specified Skilled Worker visa, created in 2019, allows foreigners to work in industries facing workforce challenges, with two visa types offering different lengths of stay and paths to permanent residency. As of the end of 2024, there were more than 280,000 holders of this visa.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, even with recent reductions. The retailer narrowly missed quarterly sales estimates but beat earnings expectations. Rainey expressed concern that the magnitude of tariff increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb. Walmart plans to keep food prices low but faces pressure on items like bananas, avocados, and coffee due to tariffs on countries like Costa Rica and Colombia, while absorbing costs on flowers for Sam's Club on Mother's Day.

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on whether federal judges can block Trump administration policies across the country, potentially reshaping the power of the judicial branch. The dispute stems from an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which was quickly blocked by federal judges. A decision limiting nationwide injunctions could curb the power of federal judges to swiftly block policies and boost executive power. The oral argument may provide hints of where the justices stand on the constitutionality of the executive order, with some justices having previously criticized nationwide injunctions.</p>

While phones can sometimes help resolve conflicts, they also present challenges in handling confrontation as teens mature.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner", the chancellor has said, after it grew by more than expected in the first three months of the year. Rachel Reeves told the BBC the 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was "very encouraging", but shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was "a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks". The growth figure was stronger than the 0.6% that had been forecast, and was helped by increases in consumer spending and business investment. The figures mark the period just before the US imposed import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased in April, and analysts warned the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year. This was better than expected, but this level of growth is not predicted to last. The numbers matter because a higher growth rate usually means people are getting paid a little bit more, can spend more and more jobs are created. Before the announcement, experts expected the economy to grow by 0.6% between January and March, compared with the last three months of 2024. The fact the actual number is a tiny bit higher at 0.7% suggests people were willing to spend more than was expected.</p>
