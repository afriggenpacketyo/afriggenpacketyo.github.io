        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 12% increase in its third-quarter revenue, reaching $28.10 billion and marking a return to growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. This figure surpassed analysts' estimates, which had projected revenue of $26.37 billion. Despite the positive revenue report, the company's adjusted earnings per share came in at 50 cents, missing the 54 cents anticipated by LSEG analysts. The revenue growth was partly driven by a 6% increase in the automotive sector, potentially influenced by consumers rushing to purchase vehicles before the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits under a new presidential spending bill.

          <h2>Economic Analysis Suggests Americans Could Receive Larger Tax Refunds in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:10:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from Oxford Economics projects that many American taxpayers could see larger tax refunds in 2026 due to retroactive provisions in the Republicans' recently enacted tax law. The law extends previous tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime income and raising the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Because the IRS has not yet updated its withholding tables to reflect these changes, many employees are likely overpaying taxes this year. This overpayment could result in an additional $50 billion in total taxpayer savings, though the report notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits will likely accrue to upper-income households.

          <h2>Strong Consumer Spending Does Not Guarantee Success for Retail and Restaurant Stocks, Analysts Warn</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite reassuring reports from bank executives about the resilience of the U.S. consumer, investment analysts caution against a broad, top-down approach to investing in consumer-facing stocks. While overall spending remains strong, significant economic uncertainties, including trade policy and the ongoing government shutdown, create a complex landscape. Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted a visible slowdown in restaurant demand in September, suggesting investors must look beyond general economic health to individual company fundamentals. For instance, while some retailers like Costco and TJX are well-positioned due to their value-oriented models, others like Texas Roadhouse face specific pressures such as beef inflation, underscoring the need for careful, stock-by-stock analysis.

          <h2>Opposition to President Trump a Key Motivator for California's Proposition 50 Supporters, Poll Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 15:38:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is heavily influenced by national politics and opposition to President Trump. Voters who view the proposition as a national issue are overwhelmingly in favor, citing it as a way to oppose the Trump administration, which many feel treats California unfairly. Conversely, those who see it as a state-level issue tend to oppose it, fearing a power shift from rural areas to cities. This national sentiment in the heavily-Democratic state is currently giving the "yes" campaign a majority lead. The poll also indicates that a majority of Californians oppose the president's deportation program and feel his policies are making them financially worse off.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced plans to integrate a suite of advanced software into its vehicles, including a conversational AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini, set to launch next year. By 2028, the company aims to release an advanced driver-assistance system that will permit hands-free and "eyes-off" driving under certain conditions, starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ. These initiatives are part of GM's vision to transform its vehicles into intelligent assistants, supported by a new centralized computing platform. CEO Mary Barra framed the announcements as the start of a "new era of mobility" for the automaker, which aims to accelerate its software and services revenue growth.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has signed a multi-year licensing agreement with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, marking the first such deal for a major sports league. The partnership will grant the platforms access to official NHL data and logos, while the league gains customer protections and brand exposure. Kalshi's CEO called the deal a "seminal moment" for the federally regulated event-trading industry, which allows users to trade on the outcomes of various events. However, the move has drawn criticism from the American Gaming Association, which argues these platforms fail to comply with essential gambling standards and offer wagering in states where it is not legal.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyers Weigh Pros and Cons of Locking Mortgage Rates Ahead of Expected Fed Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates again in October and December, homebuyers are debating whether to lock in current mortgage rates or wait for potentially lower ones. Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protects against unexpected market spikes, a real possibility given recent volatility. However, with rate cuts looking highly probable, waiting could lead to significant savings on a long-term loan. A key consideration is that lenders may charge a "float down" fee to switch to a lower rate after locking, which could negate some of the potential benefits of waiting for further rate reductions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Nia DaCosta's new film "Hedda" offers a vibrant and viciously alive adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's 19th-century play "Hedda Gabler," with a marvelous lead performance by Tessa Thompson. Set during a single drunken party in 1950s England, the film sharpens the original's rage, portraying Hedda as a clever but violently bored newlywed who unleashes her frustrations on those around her. The review praises DaCosta for smartly tightening the narrative and layering in modern themes of race and sexuality, including gender-swapping a key character. Thompson is lauded for her confident and menacing portrayal of the complex antihero, capturing her feverish mood shifts and destructive impulses in a performance deemed divine.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new robotic system named "Blue Jay," designed to streamline tasks in its warehouses by combining multiple functions into one workplace. The system consists of robotic arms on a conveyor track that can pick, sort, and consolidate approximately 75% of the items stored at its facilities. Amazon states the goal is to assist employees with strenuous tasks and improve efficiency. The announcement comes amid growing scrutiny of the company's automation strategy, with a recent report suggesting it could eliminate the need for over 160,000 hires by 2027. Amazon has countered that its goal is to reduce demanding tasks and create new, more rewarding career opportunities for its human workforce.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Reverse Mortgages as a Married Couple: Key Considerations Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:25:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees facing financial pressure from inflation, a reverse mortgage can provide access to home equity, but the process involves specific rules for couples. To qualify for the most common type, a HECM, both spouses must typically be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which may result in a smaller sum than if based on the older partner's age. This article explains that while these loans can eliminate existing mortgage payments and supplement income, couples must carefully consider the long-term implications before proceeding.
