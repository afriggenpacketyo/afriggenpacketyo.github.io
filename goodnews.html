          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The cryptocurrency's rise is attributed to positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has diverged, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation are also contributing factors.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Teachers and doctors in England will receive a 4% pay rise after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies. While education unions welcomed the decision, they also warned about potential budget cuts without additional funding. Health unions expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, leading to possible strike action. These pay awards come as inflation unexpectedly rose to 3.5%, complicating perceptions of the offers' generosity. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling, preventing the state from using public funds for a Catholic charter school. This decision means St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School will not receive state funding, preserving the separation of church and state in this instance. The ruling, however, doesn't set a nationwide precedent, leaving open the possibility of future challenges. The debate continues regarding religious freedom and the use of taxpayer dollars for religious institutions, with both sides vowing to continue the fight. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-to-4 decision, effectively blocking Oklahoma's plan to use government funds for a Catholic charter school.

The decision upholds the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling, which stated that the plan violated the First Amendment's separation of church and state.

Key provisions include raising the SALT deduction limit, increasing the child tax credit, cutting Medicaid and SNAP, and introducing a 'bonus' deduction for older adults.

This review speaks to the new Final Destination film's soup√ßon of self-awareness, and the movie's ability to have the viewer scream and giggle at the same time. The article describes the premise of the movie, which involves a Space Needle-esque building that both collapses and explodes, and the well-established stakes that help the story speed through the most boring parts of the Final Destination schematic. The reviewer notes that it is fun to have a horror movie you can cheer during, and that the movie knows how to enjoy itself. </p>
