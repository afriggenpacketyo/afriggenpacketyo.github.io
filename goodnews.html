          <p>Apple is reportedly considering a major acquisition of the AI chatbot company Perplexity, a move that would significantly accelerate its artificial intelligence roadmap. Perplexity, valued at around $18 billion, offers a popular alternative to ChatGPT and operates on a freemium model, which would give Apple an established path to monetizing AI services. CEO Tim Cook has stated that Apple is open to large deals to advance its technology, and acquiring Perplexity would provide an in-house large language model and a rapidly growing user base.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar capacity, a shift driven primarily by large utility companies rather than state climate policy. Favorable economics and a streamlined permitting process for projects under 75 megawatts have made solar an increasingly cheaper option than natural gas. However, the industry faces headwinds from the phasing out of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints. Despite its progress, Florida's continued reliance on natural gas and lack of consistent political support for renewables pose challenges to its long-term solar momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

England needs just 35 more runs to secure a historic series victory, while India needs to take four more wickets. The match has been a rollercoaster, with heroic centuries from England's Joe Root and Harry Brook turning the tide after the team was in a precarious position. Bad light stopped play on a dramatic Sunday evening, leaving both teams and their fans to anxiously await the final session on Monday morning.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise their illegal services. This move aims to combat the criminal gangs that facilitate dangerous crossings of the English Channel, a journey made by a record 25,000 people this year. The Home Office reports that a vast majority of these migrants used social media to arrange their passage. The new policy is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to control irregular migration and restore order to the asylum system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic baserunning and timely hitting rather than power to break a scoring drought. After being shut out for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through aggressive sends, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team's slumping lineup as they head back home.</p>

They are campaigning on their public service records and a platform of restoring the rule of law, directly criticizing the administration's actions and the dismantling of norms within the Justice Department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, though payouts are expected to be modest. Following a Supreme Court ruling that found hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful but could be unfair if excessively high, the FCA will consult on a redress plan. The scheme could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with payouts likely under £950 per deal for agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator has advised affected consumers to complain directly to their lenders. (not investment advice)</p>
