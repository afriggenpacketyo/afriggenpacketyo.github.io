          <p>Germany's government is set to approve a 2026 draft budget featuring €520.5 billion in spending and significant new borrowing to modernize infrastructure and bolster the military. This represents a notable shift from Germany's traditional fiscal restraint, aiming to revive a stagnating economy.

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced its second-quarter net profit doubled year-over-year to $2.395 billion, significantly beating analyst forecasts. The strong performance was driven by its investment bank and global wealth management divisions, which benefited from high market volatility. CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that while markets have recovered, client activity reflects a cautious wait-and-see attitude. The bank continues its integration of Credit Suisse and is navigating proposed stricter capital requirements from Swiss regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia, residents along the California coast responded to tsunami advisories with a wide range of emotions. In Southern California, where waves were expected to be small, many beachgoers were unconcerned, with some visitors unaware of the alert. In Crescent City, a Northern California town with a history of destructive tsunamis, locals in a pub remained calm, accustomed to such warnings. The varied reactions highlight the different levels of perceived risk and experience with tsunami threats across the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the FTSE-100 stock index reaching record highs and outperforming many global benchmarks this year, its success is not necessarily reflective of the UK's domestic economic health. The index is heavily weighted with multinational corporations that derive the vast majority of their earnings from overseas, such as energy, mining, and defense firms. This international focus means the Footsie's performance is often more influenced by global trends and currency fluctuations than by the state of corporate Britain, a significant change from its more domestically-focused composition at its launch in 1984.

The settlement follows a preliminary injunction against the university and a finding by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that UCLA created a hostile environment for Jewish students.

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine animal may have practiced a form of social distancing to enhance its survival. Fossils of the 436-million-year-old brachiopod, Nucleospira calypta, were found arranged in a regular, checkerboard-like pattern in southwestern China. The researchers believe the creatures used hundreds of fine, bristle-like structures to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing. This arrangement likely improved their ability to filter feed by preventing overcrowding on the sea floor, offering a fascinating glimpse into ancient animal behavior.</p>
