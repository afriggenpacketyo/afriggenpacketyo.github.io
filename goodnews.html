          <p>Two easyJet airplanes clipped wings while taxiing on the runway at Manchester International Airport in the UK. The incident prompted a brief suspension of airport operations for assessment, but flights resumed within minutes after it was determined the planes could safely return to a stand. No injuries were reported as a result of the minor collision, and airport authorities have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the event. EasyJet is currently managing the travel arrangements for all passengers who were affected by the disruption.</p>

          <p>Undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma, aged 20, is set to face his most significant challenge yet against veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. With 10 knockouts in his 12 professional wins, Itauma has generated considerable hype and is seen as a potential future champion. This fight is considered his "breakthrough" opportunity, providing a platform to transition from a promising prospect to a legitimate title contender. A victory over a well-known name like Whyte could significantly accelerate his path toward a world title shot against top fighters in the division.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung announced his intention to restore a 2018 military de-escalation agreement with North Korea in an effort to rebuild trust and ease tensions. Speaking on the 80th anniversary of Korea's liberation, Lee stated his government would take proactive steps to reinstate the pact, which had established buffer zones and no-fly zones along the border. The original agreement fell apart amid rising hostilities, including North Korea's sending of trash-filled balloons across the border. The president expressed hope that North Korea would reciprocate these efforts to revive dialogue.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, known as the Red Roses, are the clear favorites to win the upcoming Rugby World Cup on home soil, having lost only one of their last 58 matches. That single loss was to New Zealand in the 2022 final, a defeat they have since avenged multiple times. Head coach John Mitchell acknowledges that managing the immense pressure of expectation will be as crucial as their on-field performance. The tournament, which has expanded to 16 teams, kicks off with England facing the United States, with the ultimate goal of lifting the trophy at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium.</p>

          <p>Toni, a young pygmy hippopotamus who has become a star at the Berlin Zoo, is being prepared for a move to Mulhouse Zoo in France. The relocation is part of the European Endangered Species Program, a conservation initiative aimed at maintaining healthy captive populations of threatened animals. Since her birth, Toni has significantly boosted the zoo's social media following and helped raise awareness for her endangered species, with fewer than 2,500 pygmy hippos left in the wild. The zoo is hosting a week of farewell events, dubbed "Toni Time," for fans to see her one last time before she departs.</p>

          <p>Top leaders from several Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are reportedly planning to attend a military parade in Beijing commemorating the end of World War II. This attendance is viewed as a significant display of China's growing diplomatic influence in the region. According to sources, many of the delegations will be more senior than those sent to a similar parade a decade ago. The event in Tiananmen Square is expected to follow the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, further highlighting China's central role in regional diplomacy and security affairs.</p>

          <p>Amid widespread issues with insomnia, especially during summer heatwaves, this article offers evidence-based advice for achieving better sleep. Key recommendations include engaging in daily exercise to increase melatonin production and reduce stress, and avoiding caffeine in the afternoon or evening. It also highlights the negative impact of screen time before bed, suggesting that reducing brightness and overall usage is more effective than blue-light filters. While the popular "4-7-8" breathing technique lacks robust scientific backing, its anecdotal success may make it a useful tool for calming anxiety before sleep.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities by threatening to withdraw federal funding. The judge ruled that the Department of Education's guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions to apply to all aspects of education, violated procedural requirements. The memos had been criticized by education groups for creating a "sea change" in regulation and chilling lawful speech and beneficial programs. The ruling is being hailed as a significant victory for supporters of DEI initiatives in education.</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title in his first season, Liverpool manager Arne Slot faces heightened expectations following an aggressive summer spending spree that could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116 million, signaling a clear ambition to dominate both domestically and in Europe. This significant investment shifts the narrative from a transitional period after Jürgen Klopp to a clear mandate for sustained success. The pressure is now on Slot to integrate the new talent and defend the title against strengthened rivals, with anything less than a major trophy likely to be seen as a disappointment.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has weighed in on the transfer saga involving Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, suggesting it is becoming increasingly difficult for the player to remain at the club. After Newcastle rejected a £110 million offer from Liverpool, Isak remains keen on the move, creating a challenging situation for his current team. Rooney noted that while losing a top player is a blow, financial regulations might make a sale beneficial for Newcastle, allowing them to reinvest in strengthening the overall squad. For Isak, the chance to join the reigning Premier League champions represents a huge career opportunity.</p>

          <p>Surrey Police has launched a campaign called "Jog On" to combat the street harassment and catcalling of female joggers. The initiative involves plain-clothed female police officers running in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators. An officer involved described the behavior as prevalent and unsettling, noting she was honked at twice during a single undercover run. The campaign follows a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it, highlighting a significant gap in official data and the need for proactive policing.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has started offering commercial flights to Mars, with Italy's space agency, ASI, becoming the first customer to sign on to send scientific experiments to the red planet. The announcement was celebrated by both SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell and Italian officials, though no specific timeline for the launches was provided. This move comes despite the fact that SpaceX's Starship rocket, which is essential for Mars missions, has not yet achieved a successful orbital flight. Founder Elon Musk recently adjusted his own timeline, suggesting a crewed flight is more likely in about five and a half years. (not investment advice)</p>
