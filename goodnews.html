          <p>The Eta Aquariid meteor shower, produced by debris from Halley's Comet, is expected to peak tonight, offering skywatchers a chance to see meteors streaking across the sky. Viewers in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can observe the shower, with conditions being more favorable in the Southern Hemisphere. NASA advises going outside around 2 a.m. local time to view the meteors, finding a dark location away from lights, and allowing eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p>

          <p>Hawaii lawmakers have passed a bill to increase the state's lodging tax to fund environmental protection and strengthen defenses against natural disasters. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to the existing tax on hotel rooms and a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects like beach replenishment and wildfire prevention. Governor Josh Green is expected to sign the bill, calling it a commitment to protect the land.</p>

          <p>Alpine is reportedly planning to replace Formula 1 driver Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto after just six races this season. Colapinto's signing with the team over the winter has put Doohan's seat at risk. The decision comes despite Doohan recently out-qualifying his teammate, although he has also had several incidents, including crashes. Colapinto's move has been facilitated by financial backing from Latin American sponsors, and Williams team principal James Vowles has indicated that they may have the option to take him back in the future.</p>
