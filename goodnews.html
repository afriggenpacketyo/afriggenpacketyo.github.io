          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition in parliament, reflecting a broader trend of far-right gains in Europe. This marks a significant shift in Portuguese politics, where traditional center-right and center-left parties have historically dominated. Chega's rise, securing 60 of 230 seats, is attributed to its hardline stance on immigration and the failure of traditional parties to form stable governments. The party's success mirrors similar gains by far-right groups in France, Italy, and Germany, signaling a potential reshaping of the European political landscape.</p>

          <p>Marc Marquez, once facing a career-threatening "nightmare" due to severe injuries, has made a stunning comeback to become a 2025 MotoGP title contender. After enduring broken bones, concussions, and multiple operations, Marquez left Honda, his team of 11 years, to join Gresini Racing. Now leading the championship standings and racing for the factory Ducati team, Marquez has silenced doubts about his ability to compete at the highest level. His resurgence marks a remarkable turnaround, positioning him to potentially equal Valentino Rossi's record with a ninth world title.</p>

          <p>German defense company Renk is seeking skilled workers from the struggling automotive industry to meet growing demand driven by rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending. The company, which produces tank parts, has seen its stock price surge and order book jump, prompting a need for rapid scaling. This cross-industry collaboration allows Renk to capitalize on the automotive sector's expertise in areas like continuous improvement and efficiency. While the move is seen as a positive for job creation, concerns are raised about a potential over-reliance on rearmament as a long-term economic strategy.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs. This decision, which the Trump administration is appealing, asserts that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce. The ruling has caused market volatility and uncertainty, but also raised questions about the limits of executive power in trade matters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand before the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of additional tariffs, Toyota has stated it will not pass on the cost to consumers, though analysts anticipate pressure to do so long-term. The automaker projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

Japan is seeking the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, and steel and aluminum imposed by the U.S. as part of efforts to reduce trade deficits.

This move is part of a broader streamlining plan that includes cutting 20,000 jobs and closing seven vehicle plants globally.

          <p>CBS has secured a court ruling allowing it to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television. A Los Angeles judge previously ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but an appellate panel has paused that order. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to sever ties unilaterally. The dispute stems from claims by Sony that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals and that budget cuts within CBS have hindered the shows' support.</p>
