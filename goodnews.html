          <p>Representative Michael McCaul, a prominent Texas Republican and foreign policy leader, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, concluding an 11-term career in Congress. Having previously chaired both the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, McCaul stated he will serve out his current term but is seeking a 'new challenge' in the national security realm. His retirement adds to a number of departures from the House as lawmakers seek other offices, and it comes at a time of political change within the Texas Republican party.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump has reportedly transferred from New York University's main campus to its specialized program in Washington, D.C., a move that brings him closer to his parents at the White House. The NYU D.C. program is highly selective and focuses on coursework and internships related to government, politics, and public policy. While his major at the Stern School of Business was not political, this transfer has fueled speculation about his potential future interests in the political sphere, especially given his past involvement in his father's campaign.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston experienced a mid-air incident and was forced to make an emergency landing back at Miami International Airport shortly after takeoff. The cause was a reported bird strike that affected one of the aircraft's two engines. According to the airline and the FAA, the plane landed safely, and there were no injuries to any passengers or crew members. After the incident, the flight was able to depart again, arriving in Boston approximately two hours behind its original schedule.</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Brendon McCullum, has indicated that the selection process for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia will be straightforward, describing the squad as 'pretty settled.' He stated that the selection meeting will be 'short,' with the main point of discussion being the choice of a second spinner to support Shoaib Bashir. The squad, which could include as many as seven specialist seamers, is expected to be formally announced in the week commencing September 22. This stability suggests confidence in the current group of players ahead of the crucial series.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has ushered in a new era for Jamaican men's sprinting by winning the 100m title at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo. His victory, with a personal best of 9.77 seconds, makes him the first Jamaican man to claim a global 100m crown since the legendary Usain Bolt retired. The triumph was made even more significant by teammate Kishane Thompson securing silver, resulting in a Jamaican one-two finish. This performance signals a powerful resurgence for the Caribbean nation's male sprinters on the world's biggest stage.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is reportedly investing millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. According to a recent report, his investments include high-profile companies like AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Wary of the short duration of an average NFL career, Barkley has adopted a strategy of living off endorsement deals while investing his salary to create long-term generational wealth for his family.

          <p>Liverpool has maintained its perfect start to the Premier League season through a series of dramatic, late-game victories, a trend now being dubbed 'Arne Time.' In a pattern reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, the team has won all four of its opening matches with winning goals scored in the final 10 minutes or in stoppage time. This resilience has allowed Liverpool to secure maximum points even when not performing at their peak, creating a psychological advantage over opponents and signaling a formidable winning mentality under manager Arne Slot.</p>
