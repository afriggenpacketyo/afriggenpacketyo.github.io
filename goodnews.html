          <p>China's bioeconomy is rapidly expanding, now contributing over 7% to the country's GDP, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. In 2024, 93 new drugs were approved, the highest in five years, and medical device patent applications reached 70% of the global total. This growth highlights China's strong momentum in life sciences and biotechnology, with new systems implemented to boost drug innovation and identify opportunities.

          <p>European stock markets opened higher as investors await the crucial U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Sentiment improved after recent U.S. payroll data hinted at a September rate cut without signaling a severe economic downturn. However, Danish wind farm developer Orsted saw its shares drop after revising its full-year earnings guidance downwards, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds and ongoing legal battles over U.S. projects. The broader market remains sensitive to global economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, surpassing analyst forecasts, attributed to sunny weather and the women's Euro football tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) had delayed the release due to data quality concerns and has now revised past figures, aiming for improved reliability. Despite the monthly rise, sales in the three months to July were down 0.6% compared to the previous quarter. Experts warn that the positive factors for July are unlikely to be sustained.</p>
