          <p>Soko Hardware, a fixture in San Francisco's Japantown, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925 by Philip Ashizawa's grandparents, the store faced closure during World War II due to the internment of Japanese Americans. Ashizawa's father reopened the store after the war, and it has since become a community hub, offering Japanese imports and cultural items. Ashizawa, now passing the legacy to his children, emphasizes the store's role in connecting with neighbors and sharing Japanese heritage with visitors from around the world.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker, the BBC's highest-paid presenter, is anticipated to leave the network, with an announcement expected on Monday following his final Match of the Day broadcast next weekend. This decision follows an apology from Lineker for sharing a social media post about Zionism containing an antisemitic image. The incident led BBC bosses to consider his position untenable, especially given previous controversies over his social media activity and the BBC's impartiality guidelines.

          <p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives suggests that the bull case is back for tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Palantir Technologies following a U.S. and China trade agreement. The agreement, which lowers import tariffs, is seen as a positive development for these companies, which heavily rely on manufacturing abroad. Ives noted that this could slow down Apple's shift of iPhone production to India, as the company now makes about 90% of its iPhones in China. (not investment advice)</p>
