          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record by rowing unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia broke the previous record of 162 days, despite facing severe tropical storms that forced detours and even washed one brother overboard. The successful expedition also raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, fulfilling a major charitable goal for the trio.</p>

          <p>A scenic 10-mile portion of California's Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive storm damage. The section, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, required $7.9 million in repairs to fix slope failures, collapsed pavement, and other issues from severe winters and a subsequent fire. While the reopening is celebrated by the hiking community for improving access and reducing congestion, officials have issued extreme fire danger warnings for the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>A recent rally in Chinese stocks, which pushed the Shanghai Composite Index to a 10-year high, is signaling a potential sustained recovery for the nation's combined $20 trillion equity markets. Investment managers are turning positive, citing the return of overseas investors and a shift by domestic savers from low-yield fixed-income products into stocks. Beijing's strategic push for technological innovation in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI is also seen as a key driver that could underpin further market growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision to block the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit panel ruled that the administration likely overstepped its authority, as the governing statute does not permit the Homeland Security secretary to unilaterally vacate a prior TPS extension. The court emphasized that Congress designed the TPS system to be dependable and insulated from shifting political dynamics, providing stability for recipients fleeing unsafe conditions in their home country.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B testified in a Los Angeles civil trial, denying she physically assaulted a security guard, Emani Ellis, in 2018. The trial has gained widespread attention online due to the rapper's animated testimony and exchanges with lawyers, which included discussions about her wigs and fingernails. Ellis is suing the artist for assault, battery, and emotional distress, claiming Cardi B cut her cheek and spit on her, while the rapper maintains the encounter was only a verbal altercation after she felt her privacy was invaded while pregnant.</p>

          <p>A charity program is helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them as mentors for toddlers at a local nursery. The initiative aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students, which in turn improves their engagement with their own education. Participants have reported significant increases in their school attendance and self-esteem, while the toddlers, some of whom have additional needs, also benefit from the one-on-one attention and positive role models.</p>

          <p>Following their engagement announcement, speculation is mounting about the potential wedding of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce. Event planning experts predict the couple will opt for an intimate, highly private affair at a location with personal significance, requiring strict non-disclosure agreements from all involved vendors to maintain secrecy from the public and media. Given Swift's history of embedding personal narratives and "Easter eggs" in her work, her wedding gown and event details are expected to be deeply symbolic and reflective of her romantic, era-defining style.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains such as Costa are reportedly struggling as the preferences of younger consumers shift towards new trends and artisanal experiences. The rise of viral chains like Blank Street Coffee, which appeal to "Gen Z" with offerings like colorful matcha lattes and a strong social media presence, highlights a market moving away from traditional coffee menus. Analysts suggest that in an era of high living costs and home coffee machines, legacy brands must innovate beyond standard lattes to provide unique, treat-worthy experiences to stay competitive.</p>
