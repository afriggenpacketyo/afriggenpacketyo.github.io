          <p>The UK government is proposing an extension of the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, in its offshore Marine Protected Areas. The proposal would expand the prohibited area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2, covering 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs. This move aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed they depend on, with a 12-week consultation period to gather feedback from the marine and fishing industries. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference in Nice. </p>
