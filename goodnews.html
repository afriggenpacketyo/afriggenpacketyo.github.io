          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until one candidate has a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and prevents candidates with fringe views from winning in a crowded field. While the computerized process is quick, the tabulation won't start until July 1 due to mail-in ballots, with official results expected on July 15. The new system is intended to be a more fair and accurate form of voting.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, showcasing its ability to peer into the universe's depths. The observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, aims to transform our understanding of the cosmos. It is expected to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer questions about dark matter. The observatory will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years, capturing detailed snapshots and increasing the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold. The high-resolution images and the potential for new discoveries generate a high level of optimism.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has released its first images, marking the beginning of a ten-year mission to create a time-lapse video of the night sky. The observatory will collect data on about 40 billion stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, providing astronomers with access to 60 petabytes of raw data. It is expected to detect millions of changing objects every night, enabling astronomers to explore galaxies, stars, and objects in the solar system in a new way. The observatory has already discovered 2,104 never-before-seen asteroids during test observations, indicating a high potential for future discoveries. The project has a high optimism score due to its revolutionary potential.</p>
