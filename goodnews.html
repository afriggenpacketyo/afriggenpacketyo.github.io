        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have finalized a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways for up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X planes, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and 787 order. The White House stated that this deal is expected to support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs throughout the production and delivery phases. The agreement could significantly boost Boeing's financial standing, which has faced challenges in recent years due to safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and trade disruptions. This deal would nearly double Qatar Airways' existing fleet and could also bring more attention to the controversial offer from Qatar to gift the U.S. a luxury 747 jet for use as the new Air Force One.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old Venezuelan toddler, Maikelys Antonella Espinoza, has been reunited with her mother in Venezuela after being held in U.S. government custody following her parents' deportation. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores greeted the toddler upon her return, which followed accusations from Venezuelan officials that the Trump administration had kidnapped the child. The Department of Homeland Security had labeled the parents as members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua, allegations the mother denies. The mother was deported two weeks prior without her daughter, after being separated from her partner and daughter when they entered the U.S. last year.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 13:45:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to remove fluoride supplements for children from the market due to potential health risks, despite existing evidence supporting fluoride's benefits in preventing cavities. This decision aligns with a growing trend of states restricting fluoride use in public water supplies. The FDA cites concerns such as alterations to the gut microbiome and potential links between high fluoride exposure and lower I.Q., though these concerns are debated within the scientific community. Dentists often prescribe fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water or those at high risk of developing cavities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investing $250,000 in an annuity could yield monthly payments ranging from $1,200 to over $2,600, depending on factors like age, gender, and contract structure. For example, a 60-year-old man could expect around $1,476 per month, while a 70-year-old man might receive $1,826. Joint life annuities, which continue payments as long as either spouse is alive, typically offer lower monthly income. It is important to shop around for the best rates, consider a laddering strategy, assess your health, and understand tax implications to maximize your annuity investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy defended President Trump's potential acceptance of a Qatari-offered jet for presidential use, shifting blame to Boeing for delays in delivering a new Air Force One. McCarthy argues that Boeing's failure to fulfill its contract necessitates a temporary solution, suggesting the company lease the Qatari jet to avoid implications of accepting a gift. He notes the current Air Force One planes are roughly 40 years old and require replacement. Other Republicans have expressed concerns about the security implications of accepting a plane from Qatar.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Virginia has ordered the immediate release of Georgetown academic Badar Khan Suri from ICE detention, stating that his continued detention would have a chilling effect on protected speech. Khan Suri, an Indian citizen, was detained for two months due to his pro-Palestinian activism and allegations that his father-in-law was an adviser to Hamas officials over a decade ago. The judge ruled that the government did not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims, prohibiting federal officials from deporting him. The Secretary of State had previously determined that Khan Suri's presence in the U.S. would have serious foreign policy consequences.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a bill that would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new tax reductions, potentially impacting millions of Americans. The bill includes measures such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, lowering taxes for senior citizens, and increasing the standard deduction for all taxpayers. A new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older, increased standard deductions, and an extension of the Child Tax Credit are among the proposed changes. Democrats have opposed the bill due to cuts to Medicaid and food stamps and the expiration dates on some tax cuts.</p>
