          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is issuing a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure lower financing costs for its artificial intelligence ambitions. This move comes as the company faces a challenging financial period, having recently reported a 2% drop in total revenue and a 34% fall in net profit for the second quarter. The bond issuance is part of a larger trend of companies utilizing China's relatively low interest rates, with a record US$43.8 billion in dim sum bonds sold this year. This marks Baidu's second such bond issuance as it seeks to bolster its operational flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London-based Anglo American and Canada's Teck Resources have agreed to a "merger of equals," creating a new copper behemoth named Anglo Teck. The combined entity, to be headquartered in Canada, will rank among the world's top five copper producers, a critical mineral for the green energy transition. Under the terms, Anglo American shareholders will own approximately 62.4% of the new company, with Teck shareholders holding the remaining 37.6%. The deal aims to establish a global leader in critical minerals with strong Canadian roots, and market reaction was positive with shares of both companies rising significantly.

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's recent shift in rhetoric to defend the importance of vaccines, breaking with his previous alignment with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The change reportedly came after Kennedy faced intense criticism from Republican senators, including doctors, during a tense Senate hearing. Trump emphasized that some vaccines "just pure and simple work" and are not controversial, a move seen as protecting his own legacy with Operation Warp Speed, which accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development. The article suggests that the negative publicity and pressure from within the Republican party and Kennedy's own family prompted Trump to cut his losses.</p>

          <p>French artificial intelligence firm Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of nearly $14 billion following a new Series C funding round. Dutch chip-equipment manufacturer ASML was the lead investor, injecting 1.3 billion euros to secure an 11% stake in the Paris-based company. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation and highlights the continued massive flow of capital into the AI industry. Existing investors like Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz also participated, reinforcing Mistral's position as a key European competitor to American AI giants like OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-running succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has been resolved, ensuring his son Lachlan will control the family's trust and, by extension, the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. The agreement, which ends all litigation, will see siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence sell their holdings and cease being beneficiaries of the trust containing Fox and News Corp shares. This deal finalizes Lachlan's leadership, which began when his father stepped back in 2023, and ends years of family turmoil that famously inspired the TV show "Succession."</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in new league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital taking the top spots. The rankings assess trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables will help identify where support is needed, but some trusts have questioned the metrics used. Top-performing trusts will gain more autonomy, while those at the bottom, like Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, will receive enhanced support to address their shortcomings.</p>

          <p>According to HSBC co-CEO David Liao Yi-chien, multinational corporations are increasingly directing their investments in China toward high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors. Speaking at a trade fair, Liao stated that this trend reflects a strategy to position China as a global hub for innovation and growth, not just a manufacturing base. A recent HSBC survey found that 44% of polled multinational companies ranked China as their top target market for expanding trade capabilities. This continued foreign investment is attributed to China's vast market size, comprehensive industrial infrastructure, and dynamic innovation ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is set to reveal its next iPhone models, with the launch shadowed by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, which could lead to higher prices for consumers. The new devices will be the first released since President Trump's administration imposed tariffs that affect products manufactured in China, increasing speculation that Apple may raise prices by $50 to $100 to protect its profit margins. The new lineup is not expected to feature radical changes, but may include the introduction of an ultra-thin "Air" model. The company faces pressure to innovate, especially in AI, where it has fallen behind competitors like Google and Microsoft.</p>

          <p>England's football team, led by coach Thomas Tuchel, is set to face a significant test in their World Cup qualifying campaign against Serbia in Belgrade. The match is viewed as a crucial indicator of the team's progress under Tuchel, as previous wins have been against lower-ranked opponents. The atmosphere at Rajko Mitic Stadium is expected to be intense and hostile, despite a partial stadium closure for Serbia due to previous fan misconduct. A victory would put England in a commanding position in their qualifying group, but the performance will be scrutinized for signs of a clear identity and improvement since the last Euros.</p>

This development follows a recent government guideline encouraging the use of low-orbit satellites to expand high-speed data services, particularly in emergency and maritime communications.

The tight timetable for nominations is seen by some, like MP Richard Burgon, as a "stitch up" to favor a leadership-approved candidate.

          <p>This article examines the frequent inclusion of large Boeing aircraft orders in trade deals negotiated by the Trump administration with countries like South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Analysts suggest several reasons for this pattern: the high-profile, high-value nature of aircraft makes for a visible and symbolic win for the president. For partner countries, purchasing planes is a politically palatable way to reduce their trade surplus with the U.S., as it doesn't harm sensitive domestic industries like agriculture or steel. Furthermore, with a growing global demand for air travel and long production backlogs, these deals are also pragmatic, fulfilling a real need for new aircraft.</p>
