          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator revealed a 1.35 billion euro capital raise supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, aims to bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following this move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, with India's Bharti Space Limited holding 18.7%. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that strengthening Eutelsat's position ensures France's strategic independence and paves the way for Europe's autonomy. The company's shares have been highly volatile this year, with an initial spike followed by a sharp drop. </p>

          <p>Germany's population growth slowed to 0.1% in 2024, a decrease from the 0.4% growth seen the previous year, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Despite an overall increase to 83.6 million residents, the figures indicate that deaths outnumbered births, with immigration driving the population growth. Western states experienced a 0.2% increase, while eastern states, excluding Berlin, saw a 0.3% decline, Bavaria experiencing the largest state increase. The number of foreign nationals residing in Germany increased by 2.3% to 12.4 million, with Turkish, Ukrainian, and Syrian nationals forming the largest diaspora groups. The aging of the baby boomer generation also contributed to a rise in the number of people aged 60 and older.</p>

Sakamoto expressed her desire to conclude her career the year she turns 26, citing the following Olympics in 2030 as being "out of the question" due to her age. She aims to win at least silver in both individual and team events at the Olympics, and intends to live each day to the fullest in pursuit of her goals.</p>

The story centers on Nike, a young girl who rebels against the world's absurdities to protect the "starry sky," exploring themes of loneliness, bravery, and personal transformation.

          <p>Tensions flared between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres after multiple hit batsmen led to a benches-clearing incident during their recent series. Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit by pitches three times in the series, leading to a staredown and ejections of both managers, Dave Roberts and Mike Shildt. Shohei Ohtani was also hit by a pitch, prompting him to wave off his teammates to avoid further escalation. Both managers expressed concern for Tatis's well-being, with Shildt stating that "enough is enough" after Tatis was hit for the sixth time in his career by the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>One of the most extensive collections of painted Roman wall plaster ever found in London has been discovered at "The Liberty" development site in Southwark. The fragments, dating back to before A.D. 200, once adorned a high-status Roman building and were found discarded in a sizable pit. The painstaking process of reassembling the fragments has revealed vibrant yellow panel designs interspersed with black sections, adorned with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres. The recovered artworks also include what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain and ancient graffiti, including a nearly complete ancient Greek alphabet.</p>

          <p>The proposed $10 billion sale of the Los Angeles Lakers signifies a shift in sports ownership, suggesting that top-tier teams are becoming too valuable for individual billionaires to control. An investment group led by Mark Walter, owner of the LA Dodgers, is poised to acquire the Lakers, reflecting a trend towards consortiums and institutional investors dominating sports ownership. The Lakers' financial strength and market appeal make it a sound investment, despite challenges facing the cable industry. While this shift could benefit teams like the Lakers, it raises concerns about accountability and potential exploitation in smaller, less successful franchises.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly at that time. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support the "acoustic transmission hypothesis." The study suggests that the dawn chorus may be more related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about finding food. The findings indicate that environmental factors may not be the primary drivers of the dawn chorus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience offers a valuable lesson in mitigating the impact of China's dominance in critical minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban on rare earths, Japan diversified its supply sources, investing heavily in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90%, with plans to further decrease it to below 50% this year. This strategy demonstrates the importance of stockpiling, recycling, promoting alternative technologies, and investing in diverse supply chains to ensure supply chain security.
