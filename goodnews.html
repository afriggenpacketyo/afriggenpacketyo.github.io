          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire following escalating tensions since an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants. The ceasefire was announced by President Trump and confirmed by officials from both countries. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Vice President JD Vance and he conversed with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker an immediate ceasefire. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked President Trump for his proactive role, while Indian officials reported earlier attacks by Pakistan across India.

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct in creative and business decision-making, arguing that data and research can be harmful to intuition. Diller recounts experiences from his time at ABC, where he championed made-for-TV movies, emphasizing that predicting public appetite is impossible and that instinct often trumps data. He cites the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects greenlit based on instinct rather than extensive research. Diller cautions against over-reliance on data, particularly among MBA students, advocating for a balance between structured information and human instinct.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating users' data privacy rights, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The settlement resolves two lawsuits accusing Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data, including movements, searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, the settlement covers allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos.

The probe, part of the Venera program, failed to reach Venus due to a malfunction in its launch vehicle's upper stage. Roscosmos reported that the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere and impacted the ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, with no immediate reports of damage or debris recovery. The nearly 500-kilogram spacecraft had been tracked by space agencies concerned about potential dangers upon reentry.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked Donald Trump's administration from carrying out sweeping government layoffs, ruling that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. The judge sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments, issuing a 14-day restraining order against mass layoffs. The ruling is the broadest against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (DOGE). The court stated that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, as the government is attempting to reorganize the federal government and is disrupting critical services provided across the nation.</p>
