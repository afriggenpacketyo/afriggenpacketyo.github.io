          <p>Throughout June, cities across the globe have hosted Pride Month events, celebrating the LGBTQ community while highlighting the ongoing fight for equal rights and inclusion. These celebrations trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that catalyzed the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The annual tradition, which first received federal recognition in the U.S. in 1999, was marked by vibrant parades and festivals from Kathmandu to Washington, D.C. New York City's 2025 Pride March, in particular, drew large crowds to honor the legacy of Stonewall.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a US expert on Chinese law, suggests that the current strained relationship between the United States and China has historical parallels that indicate it can be repaired. Drawing a comparison to the period after the 1989 Tiananmen Square disruptions, he notes that American students and scholars are once again beginning to return to China, acting as pioneers in re-establishing cultural and academic ties. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed an incredibly warm and welcoming reception. He believes this indicates a mutual desire to rebuild connections despite the challenging geopolitical climate and recent disruptions from the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for April 2027, will feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Walker, who died in 2013, last appeared in "Furious 7" through a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and stand-in performances by his brothers. Diesel stated this decision was one of three conditions he gave Universal Studios, alongside returning the franchise to its Los Angeles street-racing roots. The plan to resurrect the character digitally revives debate over the ethics and use of posthumous digital performances in major film franchises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contentious proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from the Republican budget bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, was removed after facing significant bipartisan backlash from lawmakers and conservation groups. Opponents, including several Republican senators and former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, raised concerns about the potential for these lands to be sold to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. Conservation advocates celebrated the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The health effects of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, have become a subject of intense debate. Public figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. have labeled them as "poison," contributing to widespread public concern and confusion. However, many nutrition researchers and scientists argue that the evidence does not support these alarmist claims. They point to studies indicating that, when consumed as part of a balanced diet, these oils, which are rich in unsaturated fats, can be beneficial for heart health.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has secured a buyer for TikTok, the popular video-sharing app currently banned in the US over national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, he stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform, with a formal announcement expected within two weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes after Trump repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law mandating the sale of TikTok by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, with the latest deadline set for September 17.
