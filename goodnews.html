          <p>Federal health officials have highlighted the potential of leucovorin, a prescription vitamin used in cancer and anemia treatment, as a therapy for children with autism. The FDA plans to approve the drug for treating speech-related deficits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder by updating its label to include cerebral folate deficiency, a condition linked to autism. This change would enable state Medicaid programs to cover the treatment. While small studies have shown significant improvements in communication for some children, experts emphasize that it is not a universal cure and stress the need for larger clinical trials and medical supervision.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the late-night show was suspended indefinitely. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew sharp criticism and pressure from the FCC Chairman. In its statement, Disney explained the show was paused "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," calling some of the host's comments "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to reinstate the show came after several days of conversations with Kimmel, concluding a period of intense debate over free speech.</p>

          <p>Walt Disney Studios has released the first trailer for its upcoming Star Wars film, “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” which continues the story from the Disney+ series. The teaser showcases the fan-favorite Grogu (formerly Baby Yoda) alongside his guardian, Din Djarin, in new adventures that include a meeting with a New Republic colonel played by Sigourney Weaver. The trailer's release comes amid heightened scrutiny of Disney following its controversial suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Some online commentators have viewed the timing of the highly anticipated trailer as a strategic move to distract from the company's recent negative press.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new immigration pathway, the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent residency for wealthy foreigners. For a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," applicants can receive an employment-based visa, a category historically reserved for individuals with "extraordinary ability." This pay-to-play system differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa program by directing funds to the government for general use, such as paying down debt, rather than requiring direct investment in American businesses. The policy signals a shift in immigration values, prioritizing personal wealth as a key criterion for entry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its newest class of ten astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group, which notably includes more women than men for the first time, is composed of pilots, engineers, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The introduction comes at a time of uncertainty for the agency, with planned budget cuts and challenges facing the Artemis moon program, but officials remain optimistic about winning the new space race.</p>

          <h2>New NHS Patient Safety Initiative 'Jess's Rule' Urges Rethink on Unresolved Diagnoses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:00:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England has launched a new safety initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their symptoms persist or worsen after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. Her family hopes the guidance will prevent similar tragedies by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists sooner. The Royal College of General Practitioners supported the initiative, acknowledging the challenge of identifying serious illnesses with ambiguous early symptoms.</p>

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030, the document is expected to be crucial for achieving the nation's long-term economic goals. The Communist Party aims for China to reach the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed" country by 2035, which would more than double its current level. This strategic planning is viewed by President Xi Jinping as a unique political advantage, providing a clear roadmap for development. However, amid growing global uncertainty and domestic challenges, experts suggest Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to successfully navigate the turbulent economic climate.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern California successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The program, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, alerted authorities to concerning online posts by a former student of Menlo-Atherton High School. The school and a nearby middle school were briefly locked down until police located the student and recovered weapons from their home. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the tip line has helped thwart since its launch, highlighting the effectiveness of community vigilance in preventing gun violence.</p>

Shedeur, once considered a potential first-round pick, was ultimately selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round.
