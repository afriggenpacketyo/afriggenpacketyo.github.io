          <p>Pop star Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have publicly displayed their affection, seemingly confirming ongoing romance rumors. Photos obtained by Fox News Digital show the couple sharing intimate moments aboard Perry's yacht off Santa Barbara, with Trudeau kissing her cheek and placing his hand on her bottom. The pair were initially spotted dining together in Montreal in July, followed by Trudeau attending Perry's sold-out concert with his daughter, where he was seen singing along. This new relationship for Perry follows her recent split from Orlando Bloom, with whom she shares a daughter, and for Trudeau, his separation from ex-wife Sophie in 2023 after an 18-year marriage. The article details the timeline of their public appearances and public reactions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Atlantic article reflects on the life and career of Diane Keaton, who passed away at 79, portraying her as a romantic figure driven by a lifelong quest for beauty in its deepest sense. Born Diane Hall, she navigated an industry obsessed with superficial beauty, yet cultivated an original and fiercely independent persona. The article explores her enduring insecurities, which paradoxically informed her iconic on-screen vulnerability and unique mannerisms, often playing "birdbrains and spoiled brats." It delves into her famous romances with Al Pacino, Woody Allen, and Warren Beatty, her decision not to marry, and her deep appreciation for art and the world around her, describing her as "ferociously herself, yet never fully comfortable in her own skin."</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, formalizing the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays, has sparked public debate in Germany. Tabloids sensationalized the move as "extra holidays," but legal scholars and the Ministry of Education clarified it merely formalizes existing religious freedom practices, not new entitlements. The article explains Germany's patchwork of state-regulated holidays, many rooted in Christian tradition, and notes similar provisions for other non-Christian faiths in various states.

          <h2>Seven Parenting Habits to Avoid for Raising Mentally Strong Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, drawing on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, outlines seven common parenting habits to avoid when aiming to raise mentally strong children. The author, Reem Raouda, emphasizes that mentally strong kids learn to regulate emotions, trust themselves, and rebound from setbacks, skills primarily developed at home. Key habits to avoid include rescuing kids from every struggle, trying to model perfection, silencing big feelings, prizing achievement above all, hoarding power, making kids responsible for parental emotions, and glorifying burnout. Instead, parents should allow age-appropriate challenges, model apologies, validate emotions, value effort, offer choices, manage their own emotions, and demonstrate the importance of rest.</p>
