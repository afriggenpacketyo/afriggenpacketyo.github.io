          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 03:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has publicly stated his strong desire to make his current loan spell at Barcelona a permanent arrangement. The 27-year-old, whose United contract extends until 2028, believes a change of scenery has significantly benefited his career, contributing five goals in 12 games for the Spanish club. Barcelona possesses an option to sign him for £28m, a notably lower fee than Manchester United would seek from other interested parties. Rashford lauded Barcelona as a pivotal club in football history, expressing that playing for them is an honor. This sentiment suggests a clear inclination to move away from Old Trafford, particularly given the current coaching situation under Ruben Amorim.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the UK achieved their highest level since 2022 during September, experiencing a 0.5% monthly increase. This surge was significantly influenced by good weather, which spurred a boost in clothing purchases across the nation. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) further reported that over the quarter spanning July to September, retail sales were 0.9% higher than the preceding three months, indicating sustained growth. Online retailing, especially in sectors like technology and gold jewelry, also performed strongly, with non-store retailers seeing a 3.8% rise in sales. These figures are vital for informing government policy and the Bank of England's financial decisions, despite ongoing scrutiny regarding the accuracy and quality of ONS economic data.</p>

          <p>China's state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the manufacturer of the C919 passenger jet, is preparing for its inaugural appearance at the Dubai Airshow next month. The company's primary objective is to identify and attract potential Middle Eastern buyers for its smaller C909 and narrowbody C919 aircraft. This strategic move signifies Comac's growing ambition to disrupt the long-standing global duopoly held by Airbus and Boeing in the passenger aircraft market. Analysts predict that Comac will garner considerable attention at the high-profile event, which draws over 148,000 attendees. The timing of this initiative capitalizes on the recent expansion of China's trade relationships with the Middle East, potentially paving the way for significant overseas sales following a period of strong domestic order growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Caerphilly by-election has delivered an "extraordinary" and humbling blow to the UK's two major political parties. Labour, historically dominant in south Wales, garnered a mere 11% of the vote, while the Conservatives secured just 2%. The election was instead a decisive contest between Plaid Cymru, which emerged victorious, and Reform UK, which achieved a strong second place, collectively capturing 83% of the total votes cast. Lindsay Whittle, a Plaid Cymru councillor for nearly half a century, celebrated his first electoral win, marking a significant personal achievement.

          <p>Concluding their high-level Fourth Plenum meeting, China's top leaders have unveiled ambitious plans to significantly boost domestic consumption and fortify self-reliance in advanced technologies, including quantum computing and hydrogen power, over the next five years. The official readout emphasizes a strategic balance between consumption and "effective investment" to expand domestic demand, aiming to foster a virtuous cycle of new supply creating new demand. While the plan also seeks to enhance China's global influence, its primary focus remains on internal development. This approach signals a more nuanced understanding of economic supply and demand, yet it avoids direct cash handouts, instead promoting targeted subsidies and consumption-related infrastructure. The overall goal is to achieve a "significant leap forward" in economic and technological strength by 2035. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has successfully developed and unveiled a groundbreaking, smart, and exceptionally tough coating specifically engineered for stealth aircraft. Detailed in a study published in Advanced Materials, this innovative material is a scalable, flexible, and ultra-thin metasurface, measuring just 0.1 mm. A key feature is its remarkable ability to withstand extreme temperatures, up to 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit). Furthermore, the coating boasts tunable impedance, which makes it highly effective for absorbing electromagnetic waves, a crucial characteristic for enhancing stealth capabilities. This significant technological advancement was the result of a collaborative effort led by Cui Guang and Liu Zhongfan from Peking University, in conjunction with researchers from Peking University of Technology and Harbin Engineering University.</p>

          <p>Böcker, a German company whose furniture ladder was inadvertently utilized in the recent €88 million Louvre Museum heist, has ingeniously launched a new advertising campaign to capitalize on the unexpected publicity. The company released a social media post prominently featuring an image of its ladder extended to a balcony outside the Gallery of Apollo, accompanied by the tagline, "When you need to move fast." Managing director Alexander Böcker clarified that, after confirming no one was injured in the theft, they opted to use "a touch of humor" to draw attention to their family-run business. The alleged thieves had reportedly stolen the machine during a demonstration, using it to make off with some of France's priceless crown jewels, a move that has garnered enthusiastic public reaction to Böcker's "marketing genius."</p>

He will also announce the expedited delivery of 100 additional air defense missiles from the UK, underscoring the urgent need to exert pressure on Moscow to enter negotiations, particularly in light of recent Russian strikes on civilian targets.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, a decision made after a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech company bosses. Trump stated that Mayor Lurie "very nicely" requested a chance to demonstrate the city's progress, while tech executives like Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce expressed optimism for San Francisco's future. Mayor Lurie confirmed the withdrawal of federal agents, citing recently released crime statistics that show significant improvements, including a nearly 30% citywide crime reduction and violent crime rates at their lowest since the 1950s. This reversal follows earlier controversy and strong opposition from local officials, who viewed the federal intervention as a political stunt rather than a public safety measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anti-Trump "No Kings" rallies have gained notoriety for protesters donning inflatable animal costumes, featuring figures like frogs, lobsters, and unicorns, as a means to challenge Republican portrayals of them as hate-filled radicals. This distinctive tactic, which originated from an incident in Portland where an officer sprayed a frog-suited protester, aims to employ absurdist humor to dismantle claims of protests being "war zones" and to make government responses appear farcical. Participants, such as NASA engineer Scott Rohrbach, utilize these costumes to voice concerns about the fairness of future elections under President Trump. Streamers Jordy Lybeck and Brooks Brown even organized "Operation Inflation" to distribute the outfits. Experts suggest that such humorous demonstrations can be an effective strategy against perceived autocrats, effectively publicizing political messages while strategically cornering officials into unfavorable reactions.</p>

          <p>The USA women’s soccer team experienced a surprising 2-1 defeat against Portugal in their initial match since July, marking a historic first victory for Portugal against the Americans and their first goals ever scored against the US. The game, which also served as a star-studded farewell tribute for two-time World Cup winner Alex Morgan, saw Rose Lavelle net an early goal for the United States. However, Portugal mounted a strong comeback with goals from Diana Gomes and Fatima Pinto to secure their landmark win. US coach Emma Hayes suggested the team's disjointed performance was a consequence of their nearly four-month hiatus from playing together. Despite the unexpected loss, the evening primarily celebrated Alex Morgan's illustrious career, underscoring her profound and lasting impact on the sport.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers secured a commanding 37-10 victory against the Minnesota Vikings, marking a significant turnaround after their embarrassing loss to the Indianapolis Colts just days prior. The offense impressively exceeded 30 points for the first time this season, while the defense showcased a relentless effort, sacking Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz five times and rarely allowing him to settle. A notable achievement was the Chargers' ability to avoid punting for the first time in four years, signaling a comprehensive team resurgence. Running back Kimani Vidal contributed 117 rushing yards and a touchdown, complementing quarterback Justin Herbert's 227 passing yards and three touchdowns. This decisive win propels the Chargers into their mini-bye period on a high note, offering valuable time for the team to heal and regroup.</p>
