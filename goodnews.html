        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as winds of 60-70 mph swept across dry farmlands, causing near-zero visibility and prompting ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. The National Weather Service confirmed this was only the second dust storm warning in its history that included the city itself, with the first being in May 2023. Showers coinciding with the dust storm resulted in reports of "mud rain." Some schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather. The article concludes by forecasting cooler, dry weather for the weekend, followed by a return to rainy conditions next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Democratic Party's response to concerns about Joe Biden's age and fitness for office, particularly in light of a new book, "Original Sin," detailing his decline. She argues that Democrats engaged in a form of self-deception, prioritizing incumbency and party unity over acknowledging Biden's obvious infirmities. The article suggests that the party needs to confront its tendency toward groupthink and risk aversion, and that a reckoning is due for the missteps that paved the way for Trump's return. Goldberg criticizes Biden's inner circle for restricting access to him to obscure the problem.</p>
