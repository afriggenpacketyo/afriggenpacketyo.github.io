          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear reactors in the United States. The orders call for a comprehensive reform of the NRC, mandating decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months. These actions also establish a regulatory framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct nuclear reactors on federal land, separate from NRC oversight, to power critical defense facilities and AI data centers. Trump emphasized support for both small, advanced reactors and large plants, while nuclear executives, including Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez, attended the signing ceremony, resulting in a rally for nuclear stocks.</p>

During the trial, Kardashian testified about the trauma she experienced during the robbery, believing she would be sexually assaulted and killed. The accused apologized to Kardashian and the court, with Khedache offering "a thousand apologies" in a note, and Abbas expressing remorse for contributing to her trauma.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling blocked the nation's first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, but a school voucher movement is gaining momentum. The House passed legislation allocating $5 billion for K-12 private school tuition, homeschooling, or virtual learning, potentially reaching one million students. This bill could bring vouchers to states like New York and California that have resisted the concept. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a dollar-for-dollar write-off for donations to nonprofits granting private education scholarships, which could be popular with wealthy taxpayers.</p>

          <p>A cargo ship, the NCL Salten, ran aground in Byneset, Norway, narrowly missing a resident's house after the officer on watch reportedly fell asleep. Johan Helberg, the homeowner, was alerted by a neighbor and found the ship towering over his house, missing his bedroom by only a few yards. Police are investigating the incident, focusing on the officer's admission of falling asleep prior to the crash. No injuries or oil spills were reported, and authorities are working to refloat the vessel. The ship had 16 crew members on board, including a Norwegian captain and a crew of Russians and Ukrainians.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed budget bill includes new tax rules that could significantly impact millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The "No Tax on Tips" provision would create a tax deduction, eliminating federal income taxes on tips for those earning less than $160,000 in 2025, but it expires after 2028. Similarly, a tax break for overtime pay would allow workers to claim a deduction, subject to certain restrictions and guidelines determined by the Treasury Department. While these provisions could increase take-home pay, some experts caution that low-income workers may not benefit, and the bill includes cuts to social safety net programs.
