          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the New York Giants 22-9, overcoming a sluggish first half to claim their first win of the season. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes found his rhythm in the second half, connecting with Tyquan Thornton for a key touchdown that extended their lead. Despite early frustrations, the Chiefs' offense capitalized on crucial plays, including an acrobatic catch by Thornton that set up a rushing touchdown by Kareem Hunt. The Kansas City defense effectively contained Giants quarterback Russell Wilson, holding him to just 160 passing yards and securing the much-needed victory, improving their record to 1-2.</p>

Each plan outlines key benchmarks and designates important industries for development, reflecting the government's long-term vision.

The win spoiled the celebration for Aces star A'ja Wilson, who had just been named the WNBA's first four-time MVP.

          <p>China's advanced GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) appears poised for a significant role in naval warfare, with recent observations suggesting it has been adapted for deployment on aircraft carriers. A notable change from its 2019 debut is the addition of visible folding hinges on its wings, a key feature for carrier-based aircraft. This development, combined with imagery resembling the drone on the emblem of China's new Type 076 amphibious assault ship, indicates the GJ-11 could become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone. The adaptation signals a major step forward in the People's Liberation Army's intelligent warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>Most markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Monday, following gains on Wall Street, as investors reacted to China's decision to keep its loan prime rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable rise of 1.28%, while markets in South Korea and Australia also advanced. The decision by the People's Bank of China to maintain its one-year and five-year lending rates was in line with expectations and occurred despite a recent rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, however, experienced a slight decline in early trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk were seen shaking hands and chatting at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, signaling a potential reconciliation after a very public falling out. The two, who previously collaborated on a government efficiency initiative, had a bitter feud that played out on social media. Musk, who owns X, later posted a picture of himself with the president at the Arizona event with the caption "For Charlie." Their meeting has sparked speculation about whether the influential figures are mending their relationship, which had fractured over policy disagreements and personal accusations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan could be part of a group involved in a deal for U.S. control of the social media platform TikTok. During an interview, Trump also mentioned Dell CEO Michael Dell as a potential participant, alongside Oracle founder Larry Ellison, whose involvement was previously known. The deal aims to address national security concerns about the app's Chinese ownership by placing its data and security under American control. Trump stated that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made progress on approving the deal, which would prevent a U.S. ban on the popular platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, these parents teach children how to repair relationships after conflict and validate their feelings. By creating an environment of emotional safety, parents provide the foundation for children to become empathetic, resilient, and socially aware adults.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has emphasized that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address rising costs and better support people back into employment. The government plans to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to look for work. This commitment comes after a previous flagship policy to cut disability benefits was scrapped. McFadden stated that the current system creates an unhealthy "binary divide" between those deemed fit for work and those not, and he did not rule out future changes to eligibility for benefits.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from MIT and Tufts University is developing a novel approach to combat Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild mice to be immune to the bacteria. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," aims to break the disease transmission cycle on the island of Nantucket, where white-footed mice are the primary carriers. By introducing an antibody gene into the mice, researchers can create a heritable immunity that is passed down through generations. The team is engaging in extensive community outreach to ensure public buy-in before any potential field trials, representing a new model for developing ecological engineering technologies.</p>
