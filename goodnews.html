This move aims to address deficiencies in weapons and munitions production highlighted by the war in Ukraine and boost the UK's readiness to fight if required.

          <p>A palliative care physician reflects on how patients facing mortality often seek to reconcile their lives with what they longed for. The essay challenges the notion of cliché bucket lists, suggesting that considered reflection on mortality leads people toward a more complicated version of the ordinary. Examples include a daughter wanting a small wedding in the hospital for her dying parent and a brother calling an estranged sister to say goodbye. The piece emphasizes that living with an awareness of death can offer the possibility of living freely.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older starting from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Despite the potential impact on medal prospects, head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction due to concerns about increasingly severe injuries among younger children. While the governing body mandated a minimum age of 12 for other international tournaments, Japanese organizers will keep domestic competitions open to younger participants. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after a doping scandal at the 2022 Winter Games.</p>

          <p>An amendment to Japan's Penal Code has taken effect, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons over traditional punishment. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory. This allows more time for rehabilitative guidance and education aimed at reducing recidivism, with 24 programs tailored to inmates' age, characteristics, and other factors. The new system includes specialized curricula for elderly inmates and addiction recovery programs, reflecting a broader effort to support successful reintegration into society.</p>
