          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, indicating investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency, adding to the positive sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is exploring the possibility of reusing soil removed from areas surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. This initiative aims to establish a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, as previous demonstration projects faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would likely be used for flowerbeds and other landscaping purposes. The move is part of Japan's efforts to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal following the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>
