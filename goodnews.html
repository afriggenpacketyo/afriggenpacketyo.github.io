          <p>Los Angeles faces significant challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovering from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential federal funding cuts. Despite ambitious promises made during the bid process, the city is grappling with a shortage of workers and supplies as preparations intensify. Mayor Karen Bass and Olympics organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman remain confident that the Games will be a success and a boost for the city. They point to the 1984 Olympics as an example of the city's ability to overcome economic difficulties.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 22:48:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization. This surge in applications is driven by a desire for protection against deportation and a motivation to promote civic participation in upcoming congressional elections. USCIS reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, with an increase in 2025 following the expansion of ICE operations. Community organizations are providing assistance to help immigrants complete the naturalization process, emphasizing that citizenship offers a greater sense of security than residency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the United States through Biden-era programs. The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members, and their relatives, directing the government to resume processing applications for migrants renewing their status. Judge Indira Talwani stated that the termination of these legal pathways was likely unlawful and would cause chaos. This decision is a major victory for civil and immigrant rights groups, who argued against the administration's efforts to strip legal status from various groups in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company's stock rose about 6% in extended trading following the announcement. While Nvidia expects strong sales in the current quarter, its guidance would have been higher without a recent export restriction on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry due to the H20 export ban, but overall global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure remains strong.</p>

          <p>The government is fast-tracking two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to shore up England's water supplies. These projects have been declared "nationally significant", allowing them to speed through the planning process. The reservoirs could still be more than a decade away from opening, and household consumption of water may need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population. Experts also warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from the south of Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes they might nest. This resurgence is due to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juvenile and sub-adult golden eagles from the Scottish Highlands. Sightings have occurred in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The return is a positive sign for conservation efforts, as golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has stated that the government is taking steps to comply with a court order to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., who had been deported to Mexico and then Guatemala. O.C.G. had informed U.S. authorities that he had experienced violence in Mexico and was afraid to return. The government's agreement to take steps to return O.C.G. represents a substantial de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump‚Äôs attempts to conduct mass deportations.</p>
