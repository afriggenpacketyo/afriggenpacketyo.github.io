          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, located near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with only the feet remaining. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze after being set on fire in 2020, had been commissioned by an American artist, Brad Downey, who viewed it as an interrogation of President Trump's immigration policies. Residents of Sevnica suspect the theft could be an act of vandalism or that the statue was melted down for cash, with many not particularly fond of the sculpture. The town has capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump through various branded products. </p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. The study also found that early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, affecting their genetic traits and vulnerability to certain diseases.</p>
