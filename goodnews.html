        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from S&P analysts, China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the US-China trade war. In the last five years alone, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the United States and Western Europe. Analysts suggest that high tariffs and China's domestic economic slowdown are motivating Chinese firms to pivot towards developing nations. This shift could potentially create a new global trade order where South-South commerce becomes a dominant force. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Talks at the White House involving Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, along with European leaders, concluded with several key developments aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Trump announced he is arranging a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin, to be followed by a trilateral summit including himself. The U.S. also hinted at providing security guarantees for Ukraine, with Zelenskyy later mentioning a potential $90 billion arms deal. Despite these steps, European leaders pushed back against Trump's dismissal of a ceasefire as a necessary precondition for negotiations, highlighting ongoing differences in approach.</p>

          <p>The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation is now offering a $100 reward for each black carp caught and reported within the state, as part of a multi-state effort to control the invasive species. These fish, which feed on native mussels and snails, pose a significant threat to the Mississippi River basin's ecosystem. To claim the bounty, anglers must follow a specific "Keep, Cool, Call" procedure, which includes humanely killing the fish, putting it on ice, and documenting the catch details for state officials. The program aims to leverage public participation to manage the spread of this destructive species.</p>

This move is seen as a vote of confidence in Intel's turnaround strategy under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, especially as the company has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom and faces scrutiny from Washington over its critical role in domestic advanced chip manufacturing. The investment caused Intel's shares to rise approximately 6% in extended trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy demonstrated a significantly more adept diplomatic strategy during his recent White House meeting compared to a contentious visit in February. Taking advice from European counterparts, Zelenskyy adopted a more formal attire, repeatedly expressed gratitude to President Trump, and skillfully avoided being drawn into domestic U.S. political tangents. This change in approach resulted in a much smoother interaction, contrasting sharply with the previous meeting where he was openly berated by Trump. The successful visit highlights Zelenskyy's adaptation to the delicate task of securing continued U.S. support for Ukraine's war effort.</p>

          <p>Qwen 3 Coder, an artificial intelligence coding model from Alibaba Group Holding, has rapidly gained traction in the global market, challenging established competitors. According to data from the AI marketplace OpenRouter, the model's usage share has surged to over 20%, second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. Alibaba claims its tool, released in July, offers top-tier performance due to extensive training on coding-related data and advanced reinforcement learning. The model's rise comes as the AI-assisted coding sector becomes increasingly competitive, with major Chinese tech firms like ByteDance and Tencent also launching their own tools.</p>

          <p>Coastal provinces in China are rolling out ambitious economic development plans focused on the marine economy, aligning with a national strategy to foster new growth. Regions like Fujian are prioritizing emerging sectors such as digitalized marine governance, offshore energy, and tourism. Fujian has already launched a marine data platform aggregating billions of data points to aid in decision-making for ecological protection and emergency response. The province also aims to expand its offshore wind and solar power production, reflecting a broader push by China to leverage its extensive coastline for sustainable economic development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to radically realign the sport geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that creating Eastern and Western conferences could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television schedules. While such a move would likely face resistance from traditionalists, it could also foster new regional rivalries. The league is reportedly considering Nashville and Salt Lake City as leading candidates for new expansion teams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team has collected long tubes of mud, known as sediment cores, from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of the Southern Ocean's history. By analyzing the distinct layers, scientists can reconstruct past marine life, measure historical pollution levels, and understand the impact of human activities like industrial whaling. This research is part of a global effort to understand the connection between the ocean and climate change. A key goal is to use environmental DNA from the cores to calculate how much carbon was stored by whale populations before they were decimated.</p>

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a 113-year-old landmark church is being transported whole to a new location 5 kilometers away. The entire 672-tonne timber structure has been lifted onto giant transporters for the two-day journey. This remarkable feat of engineering is necessary because over a century of iron ore mining has made the ground under the old city center unstable. The relocation of the church is the most symbolic part of a wider project to move the city's key buildings to safer ground, a process funded by the mining company.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit brought by Santa Clara County and other California prosecutors. The lawsuit alleged that the company misled customers about its automatic subscription renewals and made the cancellation process difficult. Without admitting wrongdoing, HelloFresh will pay civil penalties, investigative costs, and $1 million in restitution to California consumers who were charged for shipments without their knowledge and did not receive a refund after canceling. The settlement also requires the company to make its subscription terms and cancellation process clearer.</p>
