          <p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's appearance at an Iowa town hall has fueled speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Buttigieg, who previously ran in the 2020 Democratic primary and served as a key surrogate for Biden and Harris, addressed a progressive veterans' group, VoteVets Action Fund. While he did not explicitly confirm his intentions, he mentioned assessing the office and his capabilities before making a decision. The Iowa visit, combined with other public appearances, suggests Buttigieg is keeping his options open for a future White House run, especially given other Democrats are also making appearances in key voting states.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market's recovery to pre-tariff levels, investors remain cautious due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies. While the administration has eased its trade offensive, investors lack clarity on the final level of tariffs, making it difficult to predict the economy's direction. This uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investment decisions and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, holding off on further interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of the tariffs become clearer.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89. Mujica, a former Marxist guerrilla and flower farmer, was admired for his democratic principles, straightforward philosophy, and modest lifestyle. During his presidency from 2010 to 2015, Mujica oversaw the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage, as well as the enactment of abortion rights laws, transforming Uruguay into a socially liberal democracy. Mujica had been undergoing treatment for cancer of the esophagus since spring 2024, but his condition worsened, leading to his decision to forgo further treatment.</p>

          <p>Following the discovery of a prostate nodule in former President Biden, urologists are discussing the potential implications, noting that the significance depends on various factors. While nodules can be benign, resulting from inflammation or nonthreatening conditions like nodular benign prostatic hypertrophy, they can also indicate cancer. Doctors debate the necessity of routine prostate exams for men of Biden's age, given the slow-growing nature of prostate cancers and the potential for unnecessary intervention. Further evaluation, including PSA tests, MRIs, or biopsies, may be required to determine the nature of the nodule.</p>

          <p>While recent reports indicate cooling inflation, gold prices have remained strong, breaking records and surpassing $3,400 per ounce. Typically, gold acts as an inflation hedge, decreasing in price when inflationary pressures ease; however, geopolitical tensions, central bank demand, and recession fears are also influencing the market. As a result, analysts suggest gold prices could reach between $3,500 and $3,800 by year-end, though short-term volatility is expected. Investors should consider these broader economic factors when evaluating gold's potential in their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>
