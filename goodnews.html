          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow discusses his new book on Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the author's complex personality and lasting cultural impact. The article highlights how Twain's sardonic humor was rooted in personal pain and a lifelong fear of poverty, despite his fame and literary success. Chernow connects Twain's themes of politics, class, and race to modern America, suggesting Twain's work remains vital for understanding the nation's character. The piece paints a picture of Twain as "the American," a figure who embodied the country's best and worst traits.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of its release, the article delves into the making of Steven Spielberg's classic film "Jaws," which transformed Hollywood and created the summer blockbuster. Actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb recall the notoriously difficult shoot on Martha's Vineyard, plagued by a malfunctioning mechanical shark and budget overruns. Despite initial fears that the film would be a failure, Spielberg's direction and the cast's chemistry turned the troubled production into a cultural phenomenon. The piece explores how the film's simple "three guys against a shark" narrative created a terrifying and enduring cinematic experience.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal, the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall early Sunday near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. The storm arrived with maximum sustained winds around 40 mph and is moving north-northwest. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for a portion of the Carolina coast, with forecasts of heavy rain, gusty winds, and potential flash flooding. The storm is expected to weaken to a tropical depression as it moves further inland and dissipate by Monday, though flood watches continue for parts of both North and South Carolina.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in Peru's Barranca province with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city was a crucial trading center that connected ancient communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. The find is considered important for understanding the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, which was decimated by climate change. After eight years of research, the site has revealed 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, along with various ceremonial objects and artifacts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was originally conceived in 1865 to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States, not as a symbol of immigration. The article traces its transformation, noting that poet Emma Lazarus's 1883 sonnet "The New Colossus" reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles." This new meaning was solidified with the opening of Ellis Island and later championed by President John F. Kennedy, who popularized the phrase "a nation of immigrants." The piece highlights how the statue's identity shifted alongside America's own evolving and often contentious immigration policies over the last century.</p>

          <p>Despite rising trade tensions at the national level, many local US government officials continue to welcome Chinese investment to stimulate their economies, according to a chamber of commerce leader. City leaders are particularly interested in manufacturing projects that are difficult to source elsewhere. While Chinese investors are concerned about geopolitical risks, the appeal of the wealthy US market and the incentive to bypass tariffs by producing domestically remain strong.

          <p>An executive coach and human behavior expert outlines five seemingly harmless phrases that can inadvertently make a person sound judgmental, potentially damaging relationships and trust. Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can come across as dismissive or condescending, even when the speaker's intent is to be helpful or correct. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity, collaboration, and humility. For instance, instead of saying "That doesn't make sense," one could say, "Can you help me understand," to foster a more open and less defensive conversation.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans, using the construction of mosques, such as the new Namazgah mosque in Tirana, as a tool of soft power. This religious and cultural outreach is part of a broader geopolitical strategy that experts call "infrastructure imperialism," which includes Turkish investment in major projects like railways, ports, and hotels across the region and beyond. By positioning itself as the heir to the Ottoman Empire, President Erdogan's government aims to strengthen economic, political, and military ties. This strategy leverages historical connections to project Turkey as a modern regional power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has proposed that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. He advocated for a "polluter pays approach," questioning why event organizers requiring a police presence do not pay for the service, which diverts resources from local communities. The suggestion is part of a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into a smaller number of larger ones to better manage overstretched funding. Previous suggestions to make clubs pay have been met with criticism from sports bodies.</p>

          <p>A recent online debate highlights a fundamental identity crisis for Bitcoin: is it "peer-to-peer electronic cash" or "digital gold"? While only a small fraction of the population owns Bitcoin, many advocates argue its primary use case has evolved into a store of value, similar to gold, where widespread ownership isn't necessary for it to be useful. Critics counter that it's a speculative asset with no underlying value, dependent on the "greater fool theory." The article concludes that Bitcoin's limited adoption may be a feature, not a bug, if its value is derived from scarcity in a world of inflationary fiat currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the possibility of a "Tea Party moment" within the Democratic Party, where a populist, progressive grassroots movement challenges the established leadership. This idea has gained traction following the primary victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's mayoral race. The movement is fueled by widespread voter anger and a desire for new leadership that focuses more on working-class affordability issues. While a unified policy platform has yet to emerge, the core energy is directed at ousting older, more moderate incumbents in favor of a new generation of populist candidates.</p>

          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box-office success but struggles to transcend the "Christian movie" genre. The film frames the biblical narrative through Dickens telling the story to his son, but its attempts at humor often feel awkward and detract from the material's gravity. While it may appeal to its target religious audience, the article argues that its on-the-nose evangelism and lack of character depth fall short of its goal to engage nonbelievers. It contrasts the film with more artful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Chosen."</p>

Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have not changed dramatically, and GDP growth continues at a modest pace. The article argues that Trump's policies were unlikely to create a "golden age" and that the feared "economic catastrophe" from his tariffs was averted when he quickly moderated the most extreme rates. However, with consumer sentiment low and voters unhappy, an "okay" economy may not be politically sufficient for the administration. (not investment advice)</p>
