          <p>Starbucks is exploring options for its China business, including a possible stake sale, as growth in the region stalls due to macroeconomic pressures and increased competition from local players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee. The coffee chain has contacted private equity firms and technology companies to gauge interest in the assets, which could be valued at several billion dollars. Starbucks currently operates over 7,750 stores in China and generated approximately $740 million in net revenue during the quarter ending in March, while Luckin's net revenue was $1.2 billion in the same period. The company may decide not to proceed with a deal, but is expected to submit initial feedback soon.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with President Trump's "one, big beautiful bill," a major budget package addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities, despite internal divisions. Three committees have voted to advance contentious parts of the bill, but Republicans remain divided on issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT), Medicaid, and food stamp changes. The Ways and Means Committee advanced the tax portions after nearly 18 hours of debate, while the Energy and Commerce Committee addressed Medicaid cuts, including work requirements. The Agriculture Committee also voted on food stamp changes, increasing the age requirement for able-bodied adults. The House aims for a vote next week, but the Senate still needs to weigh in.</p>

The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before potentially reaching the governor's office.

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes would protect "media plurality" while helping publishers secure funding.

The revival of the thrusters, which had been out of action since 2004, ensures that the spacecraft can maintain its orientation and continue sending back data. The engineers took a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters.
