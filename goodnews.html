          <p>A heated skirmish broke out between Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Quinyon Mitchell and Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive lineman Tristan Wirfs during the first quarter of their game. The confrontation occurred after a near-interception, with players from both teams pushing and shoving. During the incident, Mitchell appeared to grab and remove Wirfs' helmet before the players were separated. Despite the physical altercation, no penalties were called on either Mitchell or Wirfs for their roles in the scuffle.</p>

          <p>Amir Amiri, an American citizen who was detained in Afghanistan nine months ago, has been released and is returning to the United States. His release was facilitated by Qatari diplomats who coordinated with the U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Qatar has been representing U.S. interests in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control in 2021 and has previously helped secure the freedom of other American citizens. Negotiations for Amiri's release began in March and continued for several months before a successful resolution this weekend.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated he is confident that the new deal for TikTok's U.S. operations will successfully separate the company from its Chinese parent, ByteDance, and address national security concerns. The agreement, approved by an executive order from President Trump, establishes a new joint-venture company to oversee the platform's U.S. business, with American investors holding a majority stake. Vance emphasized that the new structure is designed to control data security and prevent the algorithm from being used as a foreign propaganda tool. ByteDance has not yet publicly confirmed the deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Families in rural America who depend on the federally funded Head Start program are worried about its future following proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration. For many in small towns, Head Start is the only accessible option for childcare, enabling parents to work while providing crucial early education, health, and nutrition services for their children. The article highlights that nearly half of all children served by the program live in rural districts, where it also functions as a key local employer and economic contributor. Despite bipartisan public support, recent funding freezes have left local centers feeling their future is tenuous.</p>

          <p>The new film "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, debuted at number one at the domestic box office with $22.4 million. The adult drama, which also stars Sean Penn and Regina Hall, met industry expectations and represents another success for Warner Bros. this year. The film's solid opening is seen as a positive sign for adult-oriented dramas, a genre that has struggled to attract audiences back to theaters since the pandemic. The movie's strong critical reception and awards buzz likely contributed to its successful launch.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been ruled out of his Sunday singles match against Harris English of the U.S. due to a neck injury. As per Ryder Cup rules, the match was declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. The withdrawal means Europe, which held a significant lead, now needs only two more points to retain the trophy. Hovland's injury flared up after his Saturday morning foursomes match, and he was unable to recover in time to play in the final day's singles competition.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Voters Narrowly Approve Introduction of Voluntary Digital ID System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have voted by a slim margin of 50.4% to approve a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system. The new digital ID will be state-controlled and data will be stored decentrally on users' smartphones, addressing privacy concerns that led to the rejection of a similar proposal in 2021. Supporters argue the system will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential data misuse and the erosion of privacy. Citizens can still use traditional physical ID cards.</p>

          <p>In a public referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to impose severe restrictions on the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. The new rules completely ban gas-powered devices and limit the use of electric models to a three-month period from October to December. Supporters of the measure argued that the devices are a nuisance, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms. Opponents criticized the move as an example of an "anti-social culture of prohibition" that would create unnecessary difficulties for property maintenance.</p>
