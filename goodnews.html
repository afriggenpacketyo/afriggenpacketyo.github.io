          <p>Joe Root demonstrated exceptional skill and determination, finishing the day unbeaten on 99 and guiding England to a score of 251-4 against India at Lord's. On a slow and challenging pitch, England adopted a cautious approach, grinding out runs in difficult conditions. Despite losing early wickets, Root anchored the innings with crucial partnerships, first with Ollie Pope and then with captain Ben Stokes. His performance was pivotal in stabilizing the team after they found themselves in precarious positions. Root's innings has positioned England competitively at the close of an attritional day of Test cricket.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 13:35:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At an annual recovery conference, European leaders have made a strong appeal to private businesses and equity firms to begin investing in the reconstruction of Ukraine immediately, even as the war with Russia continues. The call to action was accompanied by the announcement of a new equity fund and several public-private partnerships. This initiative aims to stimulate Ukraine's economy and infrastructure now, rather than waiting for the conflict to end. The push for private sector involvement comes amid growing uncertainties about the long-term commitment of international partners, particularly the U.S., to Kyiv's defense and recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article provides six key facts about the deep historical connections between the United States and Liberia. It explains that English is Liberia's official language and the nation was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, leading to a strong American influence on its culture, language, and institutions. The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag closely resembles that of the U.S. The piece aims to provide context that may have been missing from the brief diplomatic exchange.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is being considered on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit. If the meeting occurs, it would be the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also suggested that the U.S. might ask for Beijing's assistance in persuading Russia to end the war in Ukraine, acknowledging China's support for Moscow's efforts. This potential diplomatic engagement comes despite Rubio's historically hawkish stance on China and his being sanctioned twice by Beijing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The judge certified a class action lawsuit that includes all children who would be affected by the order, which seeks to deny citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to parents who are not legal residents. The ruling challenges the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. This decision is a significant legal setback for the administration's policy, with the judge stating that the deprivation of U.S. citizenship constitutes clear irreparable harm.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the historical and cultural significance of the terms 'highbrow,' 'lowbrow,' and 'middlebrow,' using Virginia Woolf's unpublished 1932 letter as a focal point. Woolf fiercely defended the 'highbrow' as a pursuit of intellectual ideas, while viewing the 'lowbrow' as an honest reflection of life, saving her sharpest critique for the 'middlebrow'—a consumer of art she deemed dishonest and fashionable. The essay traces the evolution of these concepts from the early 20th century, a time of expanding mass media, to their modern-day applications for anything perceived as pedestrian. It reflects on the enduring debate over taste and cultural value.</p>

          <p>The very first Hermès Birkin bag, created for and once owned by the late singer and actor Jane Birkin, has been sold for $10.1 million at a Sotheby's auction in Paris. This sale establishes a new world record for the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag's creation stemmed from a chance 1984 encounter between Birkin and then-Hermès leader Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight, where she expressed the need for a larger, more practical purse. The resulting design has since become a global symbol of luxury and exclusivity, making this original piece a unique item of fashion history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates near all-time highs, this article examines six signs that credit card debt forgiveness could be a financially beneficial option. This debt relief strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed. It may be a viable solution if you are paying more in interest than principal, are eligible for a significant balance reduction, or face a lengthy and costly repayment timeline. While this approach can negatively impact a credit score, it can also result in substantial long-term savings for those overwhelmed by high-interest debt.</p>

The positive news from Delta, the first major U.S. airline to report quarterly results, also lifted the shares of other carriers. The airline's performance was bolstered by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express, indicating resilience in higher-end travel demand.

          <p>Following a solid June sales report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised that Costco is a stock to own, particularly as a hedge against inflation and potential tariff impacts. He argues the company's business model, which prioritizes keeping prices low for its members, makes it a resilient choice in a challenging retail environment. While the company's U.S. comparable sales growth was slightly below Wall Street estimates, overall performance remains strong, with factors like gold bar sales creating tough year-over-year comparisons.

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of the potential earnings from depositing $20,000 into either a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed rate for a set term, providing guaranteed returns. Calculations show that for 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms, a CD currently offers slightly higher, guaranteed interest earnings than a money market account, assuming the latter's rate remains constant. The choice depends on the saver's need for liquidity versus guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Switzerland has enacted a new law requiring food producers and restaurants to disclose on labels if animal products come from animals that underwent painful procedures without anesthetic. This includes practices like the castration of piglets, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. The law also requires labels to explain that foie gras is made by force-feeding birds. While falling short of an import ban sought by animal advocates, the regulation aims to increase transparency for consumers at the point of purchase. It represents a significant experiment in using labeling to inform the public about standard, often cruel, practices in industrial animal agriculture.</p>
