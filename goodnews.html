          <h2>United Airlines CEO Urges FAA to Address Newark Airport Delays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 15:49:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby sent a letter to employees outlining steps he believes the FAA should take to resolve ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, including limiting flights during construction, reinstating slot controls, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing air traffic control. The delays began after a radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control facility. The FAA is taking steps to improve speed, reliability, and redundancy by installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiber optics, standing up a backup system, and adding a radar data center. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce a plan to revamp the air traffic control system nationwide.</p>

          <p>Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his legal challenges to the election results. The ruling by Judge Richard E. Myers II was a major win for Democrats in the key swing state. Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court, boosting Democrats' chances of winning back the majority in 2028. Griffin stated he did not fully agree with the District Court's analysis but would respect the court's holding.</p>

          <p>New England Village Foods is recalling all lots of its 19th Hole Snack Mix in 5-ounce and 10-ounce containers because the products may contain undeclared almonds and sesame. The recalled snack mix was distributed to independent grocery markets and convenience stores throughout New England, New York, and Pennsylvania. The FDA announced the recall after a customer discovered the almond-containing product was distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of almonds. Production of the snack mix has been suspended, and consumers who purchased the recalled snack mix are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.</p>

          <p>As Europe marks 80 years since the end of World War II, the article examines the shifting dynamics of transatlantic relations, particularly concerning the US's role in European security. With Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's questioning of NATO's security arrangements, the long-standing US commitment to European defense is under scrutiny. Historians suggest the transatlantic order established after WWII is disintegrating, urging Germany and the EU to develop independent security policies. While some advocate for European independence from the US, others emphasize the need for continued cooperation, particularly in nuclear deterrence.</p>

Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy is still in solid shape, allowing the Fed to be patient.

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora warned that proposed tariff hikes by the Trump administration could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry industry.

Pandora relies heavily on manufacturing in Asia, and the company previously warned of a potential hit to revenues due to tariffs. The level of price increases consumers could expect depends on the final tariff rates and industry responses.</p>

          <p>The article advises CD account holders on whether to renew their maturing CD accounts given the likelihood of upcoming interest rate cuts. It suggests that although Fed rate cuts appear imminent, the rate cut trajectory could easily change, and the cuts are likely to be small. It also emphasizes the importance of not losing the interest-earning opportunity in the interim. The article concludes that renewing a maturing CD account can still be a smart and cost-effective move, but it is not investment advice.</p>
