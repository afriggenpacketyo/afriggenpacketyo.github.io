        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The leaders of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters following a judge's ruling that deemed the previous Trump administration's takeover as unlawful. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's decision invalidated the actions of DOGE, a cost-cutting team, who had seized the building in March after President Trump declared USIP "unnecessary" and terminated its leadership. Acting President George Moose emphasized the importance of USIP as a symbol of American peacemaking efforts, while the Justice Department has not yet indicated plans to appeal the ruling. USIP, established 41 years ago, focuses on providing analysis and resources for global peace initiatives and conflict resolution. </p>

          <p>Chinese drone maker EHang Holdings anticipates that flying taxis will be integrated into public transport systems in mainland China within the next five years. CFO Conor Yang envisions fixed-route air shuttle services by 2030, with potential air taxi services emerging sooner in cities with adequate infrastructure. EHang and its partner Hefei Heyi Aviation are the first globally to receive certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) to operate autonomous passenger drones. Trial flights are underway in Guangzhou and Hefei, with plans to commence operations in designated areas by year-end, and there's strong international interest, especially in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's crypto and AI advisor, believes the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will garner bipartisan support and unlock trillions of dollars for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks stated that providing legal clarity for the already $200 billion stablecoin market could rapidly increase demand for Treasuries. The GENIUS Act, regulating stablecoins, passed a key Senate procedural vote, indicating sufficient support to avoid a filibuster. While Sacks expects the bill to pass, he did not address concerns about potential conflicts of interest for the president and his family.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are proposing a novel approach to combat malaria by treating mosquitoes with drugs to clear their infection, preventing them from spreading the disease. A team at Harvard University has identified a drug combination that can effectively eliminate malaria parasites from mosquitoes when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with this drug cocktail, offering a new method to combat malaria as mosquitoes develop resistance to existing insecticides. This strategy focuses on curing mosquitoes rather than killing them, aiming to disrupt the malaria transmission cycle.</p>

          <p>Some Afrikaners are refuting claims of a "White genocide" in South Africa, despite the Trump administration offering them expedited refugee status. While some Afrikaners, like Dolf Grobler, express concerns about violence targeting White farmers, others, such as commentator Piet Croucamp and cattle farmer Nick Serfontein, dismiss the genocide claims as untrue. They emphasize that Whites remain economically strong in South Africa, and racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate. Serfontein highlighted efforts to train Black farmers and promote shared land ownership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are advocating for the UK's NHS to provide additional scans to women with very dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates and save lives. A study led by Cambridge University found that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly increase cancer detection compared to traditional mammograms in women with dense breasts. These alternative techniques use injections to enhance blood vessel visibility, making tumors easier to spot. The study estimates that implementing these methods could identify 3,500 extra cancers per year and potentially save 700 lives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, exceeding its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. This has increased interest in bitcoin as an alternative store of value. The cryptocurrency has benefited from liquidity in the stock market and recent risk-off scenarios related to tariffs and deficits. Additionally, on-chain data indicates less selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market, with investors anticipating catalysts like regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further drive prices higher.</p>

          <p>USC has proposed a one-year extension to its football series with Notre Dame, aiming to continue the rivalry through 2026 while awaiting clarity on the College Football Playoff format. The future of the series hinges on the number of automatic qualifiers guaranteed to the Big Ten, with USC officials wary of committing long-term without assurances they won't be penalized for scheduling a marquee nonconference matchup. Notre Dame seeks a long-term extension, but USC is hesitant due to Big Ten travel demands and potential annual matchups with the SEC.
