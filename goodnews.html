          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is reportedly phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at several U.S. airports. While the TSA has not made a formal announcement, sources and passenger experiences confirm the change at airports including BWI, LAX, and LaGuardia. This policy shift, which previously only applied to TSA PreCheck members, is part of an effort to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining security. The agency stated it is always exploring innovative ways to improve its processes.</p>

          <p>CalTech has announced it will sever ties with e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partners misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp. The suit claimed the program was marketed with the prestigious CalTech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, which still requires judicial approval, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to students and implement more transparent practices. The decision marks a significant development in the growing scrutiny of partnerships between elite universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian aggression. This decision comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some arms shipments as part of a broader review of military stockpiles. The president stated the new shipments are necessary because Ukraine is "getting hit very hard" and many people are dying. The announcement followed recent phone calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, with Trump expressing disappointment in his talk with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump stated he believes talks to end the war in Gaza are "going along very well." Netanyahu used the occasion to announce he had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. The leaders also discussed potential plans for relocating Palestinians, with Netanyahu asserting that Israel will always maintain security control over Gaza, regardless of future statehood. The meeting occurred as indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas continued, with the US pushing for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have cut tens of thousands of jobs. The agency announced that it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, a hiring freeze, and deferred resignations, making the mass layoffs unnecessary. VA Secretary Doug Collins stated that a department-wide review showed the agency was heading in the right direction on staffing and customer service. The initial plan had drawn criticism from Democrats who worried the cuts would negatively impact veterans' care.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no so-called "client list" was ever found. The findings, detailed in a public memo, aim to quell long-standing conspiracy theories surrounding his death and case. Investigators stated they found no evidence to support criminal investigations against uncharged third parties or to suggest Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals. The White House affirmed its commitment to transparency, while noting that some graphic materials were withheld from public release to protect victims.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB commissioner, an honor he found surprising but deeply meaningful. Having pitched in only nine games this season after returning from surgery, Kershaw admitted he didn't feel he deserved the selection based on his 2025 performance. However, he expressed gratitude for the recognition of his storied career, which recently included reaching 3,000 strikeouts. The veteran pitcher said he will enjoy the experience, whether he pitches in the game or not.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion purchase of 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has demonstrated the vulnerability of traditional platforms like helicopters to modern air defenses and low-cost drones. Officials stated that instead of investing in expensive legacy systems, funds will be redirected toward developing and acquiring drones and other smart systems that reflect the future of warfare. This move signals a significant strategic shift in defense procurement for a key U.S. ally.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided not to initiate legal proceedings against those who participated in the city's recent Pride parade, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, theoretically exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants who faced potential fines, though the mayor still faces investigation. The parade attracted a record crowd in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda.</p>

In his "Feminine Shuttle," he has performed over 1,000 examinations, detecting cancers and other conditions that would otherwise go untreated.

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to publish the first part of its final report, focusing on the human impact and compensation for victims. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. This initial report from Sir Wyn Williams is expected to be damning and will make recommendations to improve the redress schemes, which have been criticized as inadequate. The second part of the report, which will assign blame for the miscarriage of justice, is not expected until a later date.</p>

Analysts note that shared strategic necessities, particularly in supporting Ukraine and navigating a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, are driving the neighbors closer. The summit is expected to focus on defense cooperation, migration, and reinforcing a partnership vital for European stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting the proposed figures are not final. He argued that the administration's new slate of tariffs is likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a fixed policy, pointing to a history of postponements and reductions. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction to the uncertainty, Cramer believes the ultimate goal is to boost U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. He cautioned against major selling, viewing the tariffs as less impactful on inflation or Fed decisions than some fear. (not investment advice)</p>
