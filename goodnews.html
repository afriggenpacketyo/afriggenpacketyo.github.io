          <p>Tesla's board of directors has introduced a highly ambitious pay package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially valued at over $1 trillion, which would be contingent on the company achieving extremely aggressive growth targets over the next decade. The proposal requires Tesla's market capitalization to reach at least $8.5 trillion by 2035, a significant increase from its current valuation. This move is intended to secure Musk's long-term commitment to the company and steer its focus towards AI and robotics. However, the plan has sparked debate among analysts regarding corporate governance and its unprecedented scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland secured a valuable point in their World Cup qualification campaign with a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen, a result praised as a solid and promising start. Manager Steve Clarke's team demonstrated significant work-rate and defensive resolve, with standout performances from players like Grant Hanley and Aaron Hickey. This result puts pressure on Denmark, a key rival in the group, and provides Scotland with a hopeful foundation for their upcoming matches. The performance is seen as a positive turn after previous disappointing qualification campaigns and recent poor form.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita performed his legendary 'scorpion kick' save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium, cementing his place in football history. The audacious maneuver, where he cleared the ball by kicking it over his own head with his heels, stunned spectators and has become an iconic moment. The article reflects on Higuita's flamboyant and risk-taking style, which earned him the nickname 'El Loco' (The Madman). His career was also marked by scoring 43 goals, pioneering the 'sweeper-keeper' role, and a controversial off-field life, including a prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Senior wide receiver Madden Williams delivered a stellar performance, making two critical fourth-quarter catches to lead St. John Bosco High School to a 21-14 comeback victory over Baltimore's St. Frances Academy. Williams, a Texas A&M commit, finished the game with seven receptions for 180 yards, including a remarkable 51-yard one-handed touchdown catch that tied the game. His subsequent 36-yard reception set up the winning touchdown, sealing the win in a highly physical matchup between two of the nation's top-ranked high school football teams.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate temporary legal protections for over one million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling reinstates Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Humanitarian Parole, which allow individuals from countries deemed unsafe to live and work legally in the United States. The judge criticized the administration's decision as 'arbitrary and capricious,' noting that it would force people to return to dangerous conditions. This decision provides immediate relief to hundreds of thousands who faced deportation and the loss of their work authorization.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, a key component of its foreign policy strategy, as demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the world's other remaining communist countries. This diplomatic channel is managed by the Communist Party's International Department, which has established connections with hundreds of political parties globally. While distinct from state-level relations, these interactions serve to build political trust and advance Beijing's strategic interests. This approach has been increasingly used to enhance engagement not only with fellow communist states but also with parties in other regions, such as the Middle East.</p>
