          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a second consecutive month of growth in April, despite the impact of U.S. tariffs and persistent deflationary pressures. The National Bureau of Statistics reported a 3% increase in cumulative profits at major industrial firms compared to the previous year, bolstered by strong earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. While U.S. tariffs have impacted certain industries like automobiles and apparel, overall exports have found alternative markets. The government is implementing measures to stabilize employment, particularly for exporters, but analysts caution that challenges such as insufficient demand and declining prices persist.
