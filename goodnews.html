          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a wide range of global tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, challenging a key tool of his foreign and economic policy. The 7-4 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the tariffs were not authorized under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating this power belongs to Congress. The ruling's implementation is delayed to allow for a potential appeal to the Supreme Court, leaving the immediate impact on international trade uncertain.</p>

A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, attended by the Minister of Science and Technology, highlighted the new model for these labs, which involves clear mandates and centralized funding from Beijing. This shift moves away from loosely defined research, instead focusing the labs, including those in Hong Kong, on supporting national development and innovation priorities.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the controversy surrounding the cover art for her new album, "Man's Best Friend," stating she is unconcerned with criticism from those who don't understand her artistic intent. The original cover, which depicted her being held by the hair at a man's feet, drew backlash for its perceived submissiveness, prompting the release of an alternative version. Carpenter explained that the image explores themes of control and the lack thereof, emphasizing that her primary audience is her fans, not general critics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 17:35:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new Darren Aronofsky film "Caught Stealing," starring Austin Butler, is a crime comedy set in a grungy 1998 New York City that prioritizes style over substance. The movie follows a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld, but the plot and characters are described as cartoonish and underdeveloped. While the film successfully evokes the atmosphere of a bygone era and features notable cameo appearances, it ultimately falls short of classic New York crime thrillers, feeling more like a disposable rental from the period it depicts.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive third-round loss at the US Open to Elena Rybakina, British tennis player Emma Raducanu reflected on the challenge of competing against the world's best. Raducanu believes that top-ranked opponents are especially motivated to prove their status when playing against her, leading to consistently tough matches at major tournaments. Despite the defeat, she remains focused on improving her game, particularly her serve and post-serve strategy, as she works with her new coach to close the gap with the elite players.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to Harrisburg to protest significant budget cuts to public transportation. He aims to draw attention to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (Septa) funding crisis, which he blames on Republican inaction in the state legislature. Kenyatta argues the cuts disproportionately harm students, workers, and the elderly, framing his protest as a "time-honored American tradition of marching" to fight for working people's needs.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB and Pure Storage, experienced a massive stock rally, signaling that the financial benefits of the AI boom are expanding beyond chipmakers. MongoDB's stock had its best week on record, while Pure Storage and Snowflake also saw significant gains after reporting strong quarterly results and positive forecasts driven by AI-related demand. This performance suggests that while enterprise AI adoption is still in its early stages, it is already creating substantial value for companies that provide the underlying data and storage infrastructure.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, ruling that the administration likely overstepped its authority in ending the protections. The court found that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from shifting political priorities, providing critical stability for individuals who have fled crisis in their home country.</p>
