          <p>An exhibition at the National Museum of China in Beijing is showcasing the works of 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, emphasizing his "Russianness." The collection, provided by Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, presents the artist's life through a Russian cultural lens, from his studies in St. Petersburg to his later years. This presentation comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its national cultural heritage, highlighting the ongoing cultural and historical disputes between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Nine months into his tenure, Manchester United's head coach Ruben Amorim is tasked with revitalizing the team after a self-described "disaster season." The article details Amorim's modern, more personable management style, which contrasts with his predecessor's rigid discipline, and his strategic changes, including a new six-player leadership group. Despite his positive approach, the pressure is immense, with the club facing a challenging early fixture list. Amorim's plan involves a tactical shift to a 3-4-3 formation, supported by significant new signings, as he aims to deliver on his promise of bringing "the good days" back to Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence three weeks after her American Eagle ad campaign sparked a significant online debate. The "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans" campaign was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends. The article notes that public relations and reputation experts are divided on the long-term impact, with some suggesting the controversy could even boost her career by demonstrating her ability to generate significant buzz.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that makes biological tissues, including the brain, transparent to allow for clearer and more vivid 3D imaging. The technique creates what is described as an "ionic glassy tissue" that preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. By maintaining the tissue's integrity in a glassy solid state at low temperatures, the method enables highly accurate visualization of the brain's inner workings. This innovation also allows for the long-term storage of the prepared samples.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic mistakes by their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' sloppy play was evident early, with three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered six shutout innings against his former team, while a costly error by Padres center fielder Jackson Merrill helped extend the Dodgers' lead. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, giving them a crucial tiebreaker advantage.</p>

          <h2>China Explores 'Scissor Wing' Design for Hypersonic Drone Carrier Aircraft</h2>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier based on a novel "scissor wing" or oblique wing design, an idea once explored by NASA. Unlike conventional aircraft, this design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds like Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This innovative approach aims to solve the aerodynamic compromises between low-speed take-off and high-speed flight.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Identifies Five Psychological Reasons People Engage in Affairs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples' therapist explains the psychological drivers that can lead individuals, even those in committed relationships, to have an affair. The article outlines five common triggers, including the pressure of always being "good," the self-sabotage of perfectionism, and having poor personal boundaries often stemming from childhood roles. Other catalysts identified include being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage and experiencing a recent significant loss, which can prompt a re-evaluation of life priorities and lower inhibitions. Understanding these factors can be key to self-advocacy before reaching a breaking point.</p>

          <p>A small private plane successfully made an emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon. The pilot was forced to land on the highway due to apparent mechanical issues shortly after taking off from a nearby airport. The California Highway Patrol reported that no injuries occurred to the plane's occupants or to any motorists on the ground. The incident caused a temporary closure of southbound lanes as authorities investigated and worked to remove the aircraft from the roadway.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which included overcoming the lack of running water and electricity. The historic fortress is now a fully modernized, 40-bed party space with its own nightclub and is back on the market for £3 million. The project required workers to live on-site for years and materials to be brought in by helicopter.</p>
