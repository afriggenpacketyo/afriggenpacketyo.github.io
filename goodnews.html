          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by a majority decision in the third fight of their rivalry at Madison Square Garden, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship. The bout, which was part of the first all-female card at the iconic venue, was a tactical affair rather than an all-out war like their previous encounters. Taylor's victory was seen as a clear result, with the 39-year-old using her boxing intelligence and a strong finish to secure the win. Both fighters expressed mutual respect after the historic match, which further cemented their legacy in women's boxing.</p>

          <p>Sedrick T. Stevenson, a fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by multiple law enforcement agencies to prevent another incident. Stevenson, who was originally wanted on firearm and drug charges, had been at large for over a month before being apprehended by U.S. Marshals in Seattle. Authorities noted the extensive coordination required to ensure his secure and uneventful transport back to face charges.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when Prada presented the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, leading to a social media outcry and a formal request for recognition from an Indian commerce chamber. Following a meeting that included a senior Prada executive, the company will now explore collaboration opportunities with the artisans. The chamber is also seeking to patent the Kolhapuri chappal to protect its cultural heritage from future infringement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order halting certain immigration enforcement tactics in several Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling by Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prevents federal agents from conducting stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which accused the Trump administration of unconstitutional practices such as racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge cited a "mountain of evidence" in her ruling, which also requires authorities to provide legal counsel access for detainees in a downtown L.A. facility.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company illegally cloned their voices and sold them on its platform after hiring them for work that was supposedly for internal research only. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim related to their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The case is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles between artists and AI companies over the use of creative work.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are increasingly establishing a global presence, driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies expanding overseas. As of last year, there were 208 overseas offices of Chinese law firms, a 70 percent increase from 2018. Lawyers state that Chinese businesses prefer legal support from their compatriots, trusting them more in foreign markets. This expansion is seen as crucial for supporting China's economic interests abroad. However, while they are successful with Chinese clients, these firms face challenges in attracting clients from other countries amid rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>With the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, expiring in China next year, the market is set to change dramatically. As many as 60 similar drugs are currently under trial by Chinese pharmaceutical companies, positioning them to launch cheaper generic versions and compete in the estimated $150 billion global market. Analysts predict that the entry of up to 20 generic players in China will significantly drive down prices, making these treatments more affordable and accessible for patients with obesity and diabetes. This development could reshape the landscape currently dominated by a few major Western drugmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a major $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement attributed to global trade uncertainty and tariff policies. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will increase the port's cargo-handling capacity by 50% and enable it to accommodate larger container ships. Officials expressed confidence in the long-term necessity of the infrastructure investment, even as recent data shows a significant drop in container processing and exports. The groundbreaking ceremony highlighted the port's strategy of building for future demand in a volatile economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous former drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court.

As part of a plea deal, he admitted to coordinating the transport of various drugs into the U.S. and agreed to forfeit $80 million in assets. In exchange for his full cooperation, he will receive a reduced sentence, marking a significant development in U.S. efforts to dismantle the cartel's leadership.</p>
