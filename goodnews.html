          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's revenue and earnings per share expectations. The company reported strong growth in its search, advertising, and cloud computing divisions, with overall revenue increasing by 14% year-over-year. However, Alphabet also revealed plans to increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion, primarily to support the growing demand for its AI and cloud services. The company highlighted significant user growth for its AI products, with AI Overviews reaching 2 billion monthly users and the Gemini app surpassing 450 million.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of locking funds in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus maintaining liquidity with a high-yield savings account. This article analyzes the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit over six months, showing that a CD currently offers a slightly higher, guaranteed return compared to the variable rate of a savings account. With interest rates expected to fall, the fixed rate of a CD provides protection against this decline. The analysis concludes that for those who can afford to set aside funds, a CD may be the more profitable and secure option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the TRACERS mission, consisting of two identical satellites designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to provide critical data on space weather, which can disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and endanger astronauts. Flying in tandem, the satellites will measure how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere, driving phenomena like auroras and potentially harmful electrical currents. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for various research purposes, including testing 5G communications and measuring Earth's energy balance.</p>

The company saw robust performance across its software, consulting, and infrastructure segments, with hybrid cloud revenue showing 16% growth.

          <p>The new film 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' is being praised as a refreshing departure from typical modern superhero blockbusters. Directed by Matt Shakman, the movie adopts a staid, retro tone reminiscent of classic sci-fi, focusing on the established, adult team of heroes rather than a frantic origin story. The plot centers on the team confronting the world-devouring entity Galactus, presenting a lean narrative about self-control versus gluttony. Critics are highlighting the film's emotionally credible performances from its cast, including Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby, and its sleek, vintage aesthetic as its greatest strengths.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a dramatic increase, rising by more than 42% over the last twelve months to just under $3,431 per ounce. This significant surge is largely attributed to investors seeking a reliable hedge against persistent inflation, which has been a major economic concern. The article highlights that gold has transformed from a simple portfolio protector into a profitable asset, with some experts predicting it could reach $4,000 per ounce. It advises that while the price is high, there is still an opportunity for investors to enter the market, possibly through fractional ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A discussion with exercise metabolism researcher Tim Podlogar reveals the critical role of carbohydrate consumption in the performance of elite cyclists competing in the Tour de France. To sustain the extreme physical demands of the multi-stage race, athletes must consume thousands of calories daily, with a significant focus on carbohydrates to fuel their muscles and aid recovery. This nutritional strategy, often referred to as a carbohydrate revolution, involves precise planning and intake of gels, drinks, and solid foods during and after each stage. The approach is essential for maintaining energy levels and preventing fatigue over the grueling three-week event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled its AI Action Plan, a comprehensive strategy with over 90 policy actions aimed at ensuring U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The plan prioritizes accelerating innovation by removing what it calls "bureaucratic red tape" and "ideological bias." Key pillars include expediting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, updating the electric grid, and establishing rules for government AI contractors to promote free expression. The initiative also seeks to withhold federal funding from states with what it deems burdensome AI regulations, reflecting a strong focus on deregulation to compete globally.</p>

          <p>According to former captain Michael Vaughan, the inclusion of veteran spinner Liam Dawson makes England a better and more balanced Test cricket side. Playing in his first Test in eight years, Dawson made an immediate impact by dismissing a key Indian batsman and providing excellent control with his bowling on day one of the fourth Test. Vaughan argues that Dawson's all-around package—consistent bowling, reliable batting, and solid fielding—is exactly what England needs, particularly on home pitches. Dawson himself expressed that he didn't expect to play for England again and is focused on enjoying the opportunity.</p>
