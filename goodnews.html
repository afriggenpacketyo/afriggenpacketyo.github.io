          <p>An almanac feature looks back to March 31, 1791, when Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton authorized the construction of the Cape Henry Lighthouse in Virginia. This marked a significant moment as it was the first lighthouse entirely funded and built by the U.S. government, rather than an individual state. Completed the following year for $17,700, the original structure served for nearly 90 years before being replaced. The article notes the evolution of lighthouses, their automation since 1998, and the fact that Boston Light is now the only one that still has a Coast Guard Keeper.</p>

          <p>This article presents three primary financial metrics for individuals aiming to become millionaires: net worth, savings rate, and rate of return. It suggests that accredited investors can explore real estate through platforms like FNRP and Homeshares to grow their net worth. The piece emphasizes the importance of increasing one's personal savings rate, noting that the U.S. average is quite low, and recommends shopping for better insurance rates to cut expenses. Finally, it highlights the power of the rate of return, explaining how investing in assets like S&P 500 ETFs or gold can significantly accelerate wealth growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Columbus, Ohio, saved $60,000 to take a 13-month sabbatical in Taipei, Taiwan, with their young son, Forrest. Their primary motivation was to allow Forrest to spend extended time with his paternal grandparents and for the family to immerse themselves in Taiwanese culture without work pressures. During the break, Jason focused on his mental and physical health, leading to a realization that their family could be happier with less income and more flexibility. The transformative experience also included an unexpected joy, as the couple welcomed their second child, Ruby, during their stay.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly turning to autonomous AI agents to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. These AI "teammates" are being used to automate routine and time-consuming tasks like analyzing alerts and investigating potential threats, freeing up human analysts to focus on more critical work. Companies like ReliaQuest are developing role-based AI agents that can handle tasks such as monitoring executive travel or quarantining suspicious emails. While not seen as a replacement for human workers, this technology is viewed as essential for keeping pace with the evolving threat landscape and addressing the cybersecurity skills gap.</p>

          <h2>Debut Novel 'The Hounding' Explores Themes of Femininity, Fear, and Witchcraft</h2>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is set in 18th-century England and centers on five mysterious sisters who are accused of witchcraft after being seen transforming into dogs. The story is told from the perspective of five outsiders, examining how a community's fear and suspicion can curdle into hatred, particularly when directed at women who transgress social norms. The review notes that the novel directly engages with the historical subtext of witch stories, where femininity itself is often perceived as a menace. While the article finds some of the book's commentary on misogyny to be familiar, it praises its lush, violent prose and its fresh perspective on persecution.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little achieved a remarkable feat by successfully kicking a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The kick, which would have shattered the current NFL record of 66 yards held by Justin Tucker, will not be officially recorded because it occurred in a preseason match. Despite this, the accomplishment was celebrated enthusiastically by his teammates and drew praise from quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who called it an incredible weapon for the team. Little, a sixth-round draft pick, expressed his excitement and credited adrenaline for the stunning kick.</p>

          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are offering temporary sales tax holidays in 2025, allowing shoppers to purchase certain items without paying state and sometimes local sales tax. These events are politically popular and often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, with eligible items typically including clothing, school supplies, and computers under a certain price limit. While tax experts note that consumers often just shift the timing of planned purchases, these holidays can provide relief for families squeezed by higher costs.

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship. The hull was exposed after a storm, and the local community rallied to preserve the 12 tons of oak timbers. Researchers have since identified the vessel as the whaling ship Earl of Chatham, which sank in a storm in 1788. Further investigation revealed its earlier identity as the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy ship built in 1749 that was active during the American Revolution before being sold for commercial use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the psychological concept of negativity bias, explaining that humans are evolutionarily hardwired to focus on threats and bad news. This bias is amplified by the media's traditional role as a watchdog, which often leads to a disproportionate focus on problems and crises. The author argues that this can create a skewed perception of reality, obscuring genuine, albeit slower, stories of progress, such as falling murder rates or fewer deaths from extreme weather. Embracing a realistic optimism by acknowledging positive developments is presented as a necessary tool for fostering resilience and inspiring action to solve problems.</p>

          <p>A meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by scientists as being older than our planet. Researchers at the University of Georgia analyzed fragments of the rock and determined it to be a chondrite, a common type of stony meteorite. Based on this classification, the object is estimated to have formed approximately 4.56 billion years ago, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. The event, which caused a loud boom and was witnessed across the state, marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia's history.</p>

The restoration, funded by a $25 million state grant, painstakingly recreated the building's original appearance, including the reception hall where new arrivals were processed.

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision included in President Trump's major new spending bill is causing both interest and confusion among service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, but key details remain unclear, such as which occupations qualify and how different types of gratuities will be treated. Some workers are skeptical, feeling the benefit seems "too good to be true," while others misunderstand that it is a deduction, not an exemption, meaning they will still owe state and payroll taxes. The IRS is expected to provide clarification on the new rules in October.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley explores her life in the "middle place" of eating disorder recovery, a state between acute illness and full wellness. Tarpley, who was diagnosed with anorexia at 13, writes about the challenge of perfectionism in recovery and how shifting to a mindset that accepts slips and setbacks has allowed her to live a full life. The article discusses how this perspective can make recovery feel more attainable for those who struggle with the all-or-nothing thinking common to eating disorders. It also touches on the challenges of parenting while still navigating one's own recovery journey.</p>

The advice columnist suggests a pragmatic, "reducetarian" approach rather than an all-or-nothing one. This involves making choices that reduce animal suffering, such as opting for pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products and choosing larger animals like cows over chickens to minimize the number of lives impacted.

The argument is framed by both scientific potential and geopolitical necessity, citing China's plans for its own larger, nuclear-powered lunar base.
