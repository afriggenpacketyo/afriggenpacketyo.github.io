          <h2>Targeted Cancer Drugs May Replace Chemotherapy for Some Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a class of targeted cancer therapies, could eventually replace chemotherapy and its harsh side effects. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs. While it may take years for ADCs to fully replace chemotherapy, some companies believe they have already demonstrated the ability to do so in certain settings, with AstraZeneca leading the way towards establishing ADCs as a precision-based approach.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will not launch any new products in the U.S. containing these ingredients. About 10% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. items use these synthetic additives, which include brands like Crystal Light, Kool-Aid, MiO, Jell-O, and Jet-Puffed. This decision follows pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services to reduce artificial dyes in food, aligning with the 'Make America Healthy Again' platform. The FDA plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year, replacing them with natural alternatives.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates National Guard rescued the crew of an oil tanker, Adalynn, after it collided with another tanker, Front Eagle, near the Strait of Hormuz. The incident, which occurred 24 nautical miles off the UAE coast, was described by British maritime security firm Ambrey as not security-related. Frontline, the company managing Front Eagle, confirmed the collision and reported a fire on deck, emphasizing that it was a navigational incident unrelated to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. The Strait of Hormuz is a critical maritime entry point for a significant portion of the world's oil supply.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company," explores how Apple's relationship with China transformed the country into a manufacturing powerhouse. The book details how Apple's demand for meticulous manufacturing and cutting-edge designs led to significant investments and training for the Chinese workforce. By 2012, Apple's investment in machinery in China reached $7.3 billion, and the company estimates it has trained at least 28 million workers since 2008. This transformation has raised questions about whether Apple inadvertently contributed to the geopolitical rise of one of America's biggest adversaries.</p>

          <p>Extreme drought and water shortages are increasingly affecting crops, economies, and lives worldwide, with varying impacts depending on the type of drought. Meteorological droughts compare actual precipitation to averages, while agricultural droughts affect farming and crop production. Hydrological droughts occur when water levels in rivers and reserves fall below minimums, and socioeconomic droughts impact society and the economy. Ecological droughts destabilize ecosystems. Experts emphasize the need to limit climate change and adapt by using water more efficiently, as demonstrated by Singapore's water conservation strategies.</p>
