          <p>Astronaut Jim Lovell, renowned for his command of the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. He is celebrated for masterfully guiding his crew back to Earth after an onboard explosion aborted their 1970 moon landing attempt, a feat NASA hailed as turning "a potential tragedy into a success." Lovell was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, making him the first person to journey to the Moon twice, though he never walked on its surface. His life, from a childhood fascination with rockets to becoming a national hero, embodies a story of perseverance and courage in the face of immense challenges.</p>

          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit has ended his venture to become an NFL player, opting to return to rugby union after a brief stint with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Experts suggest that a combination of factors, including a back injury, a coaching staff change, and the immense challenge of transitioning to a new sport at the elite level, influenced his decision. While his speed is notable, it was not considered exceptional by top NFL standards, and he faced a steep learning curve. Despite the American dream being cut short, analysts believe the experience has matured him as a person and athlete, and he is expected to make a significant impact upon his return to Welsh rugby.</p>

The team's mindset has been shaped by mountaineer Jo Bradshaw, who spoke to the players about the strategic patience required for a successful ascent.

          <p>The EU's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil is unlikely to derail a potential EU-India free trade agreement, according to experts. The move is seen as largely symbolic, with a far greater pressure on New Delhi coming from the US threat of high tariffs on Indian goods. Paradoxically, this American pressure could strengthen India's motivation to finalize a deal with the EU, as it seeks to diversify its trade relationships with more predictable partners. This dynamic could inadvertently benefit the EU's strategic and economic goals while also potentially nudging India to reduce its reliance on Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, a distinguished public servant who uniquely served as the director of both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. His extensive career included service as a US Navy lieutenant in two wars, a federal prosecutor, and a federal judge before leading the two powerful agencies. He directed the FBI from 1978 to 1987 under Presidents Carter and Reagan, and then led the CIA from 1987 to 1991 under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Webster is remembered for his unwavering integrity and decades of dedicated service to the United States.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created large, pure samples of hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a breakthrough that has eluded researchers for decades. This rare form of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to form under immense heat and pressure. Previous attempts by other teams had only produced small or mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's ability to synthesize high-purity hexagonal diamond crystals provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens new possibilities for research and application.</p>

The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, undocked from the ISS in a SpaceX Dragon capsule for an 18-hour trip to a splashdown off the California coast. During their mission, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, studying subjects like plant growth and cell behavior in microgravity. Their departure concludes NASA's 10th successful commercial crew rotation, which had previously delivered the replacement for a stranded Starliner crew.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a heightened genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease as a pivotal "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery, made during the filming of his TV show, revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the news prompted him to question his purpose and focus more on what he contributes rather than what he collects. This change in mindset is reflected in the second season of his show, where he takes a more active, educated role in exploring challenges to improve long-term health.</p>

          <p>In an era of economic uncertainty, a consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is booming, as people spend on everything from small pick-me-ups to major life experiences to boost their morale. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," sees consumers cutting back on daily essentials but splurging on items like concert tickets or collectibles to find moments of joy. Analysts note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership becoming less attainable for many, people are shifting to celebrating smaller "inch-stones." This trend is expected to persist as it provides a psychological respite during prolonged periods of financial and global instability. (not investment advice)</p>

Firefighters responded swiftly, and the city's mayor praised their "rapid and magnificent intervention" for preventing a potential catastrophe. The fire was quickly controlled and extinguished, though it evoked memories of the devastating 2019 fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the retailer overcharged customers in its California stores. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed that Walmart violated state laws by selling items, particularly those sold by weight, for higher prices than advertised or labeled. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures ensuring employees accurately weigh and price products.
