The discovery, officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion, marks the 48th blood group system in the world. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type, which was identified after a very unusual antibody was found in her blood sample during routine tests. Scientists hope to find other people with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the health benefits of lemon water, separating fact from fiction. While lemon water is hydrating and contains a small dose of vitamin C and antioxidants, it won't "detox" the body or lead to weight loss. Experts recommend drinking it as a part of a soothing morning routine and to support digestion, while being mindful of its acidity and potential impact on tooth enamel. The article concludes that lemon water is a healthy habit as long as its limitations are understood.</p>

          <p>Experts say US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays, despite a brutal heatwave affecting much of the U.S. The issue is attributed to regulatory differences, with the FDA's lengthy approval process hindering the introduction of newer UV-filtering ingredients. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend mineral-based options.</p>
