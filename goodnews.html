          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to keep its key interest rates unchanged, holding the deposit facility rate at 2% for the second consecutive meeting. This decision comes as the Eurozone economy grapples with sluggish growth and lingering uncertainty following the implementation of U.S. tariffs. While inflation is near the bank's 2% target, concerns remain about the potential economic impact of trade disputes, particularly after recent threats from the Trump administration. The ECB stated it will maintain a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach without pre-committing to a future rate path. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real estate platform Opendoor has announced significant leadership changes, appointing former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and naming co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The news prompted a 36% surge in the company's stock, continuing a dramatic recovery from a near-delisting earlier in the year. The appointments follow the resignation of the previous CEO after a pressure campaign from investors, including Rabois. This leadership shake-up is seen as a pivotal move to stabilize the company, which has recently gained "meme stock" status due to a surge in retail investor interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marc Lasry, former co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, stated in an interview that he does not believe Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer tried to circumvent the NBA's salary cap. The comments address recent reports alleging that a $28 million sponsorship deal for star player Kawhi Leonard from a company Ballmer invested in was a covert payment. The NBA has launched an investigation into the matter. Lasry defended Ballmer's character, describing him and his partner as "honorable" and suggesting the allegations are likely "a lot of smoke" without substance.</p>

During the same period, their holdings in private equity have decreased from 26% to 21%. This move towards public equities is particularly pronounced among family offices in the Americas. Despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation, these firms maintain a "pro-risk asset mix" and are reportedly poised to invest opportunistically during market dislocations.

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles III, during a visit to the U.K., marking their first private meeting since February 2024. The encounter, which took place over tea at Buckingham Palace, is a notable event amid the strained relationship within the royal family since Harry and Meghan stepped back from their official roles. While Harry commented that his father was "doing great" amid his cancer treatment, he did not meet with his brother, Prince William. Royal experts note that the relationship between the two brothers remains non-existent, with no immediate prospect of reconciliation.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down a law that prevented husbands from taking their wives' surnames, ruling that it constituted gender-based discrimination. The landmark case was brought by two couples who argued the existing law was archaic, patriarchal, and violated the equality rights in the country's post-apartheid constitution. The ruling was unopposed by the government's ministers of Home Affairs and Justice. Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's decision, marking a victory for gender equality in the nation.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has approved a major project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam, a strategic hub in the Yangtze Economic Belt. The initiative, estimated to cost 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), involves building a new double-line, five-stage lock system to ease traffic congestion. Described as the largest integrated project on the Yangtze River since the original dam, it is scheduled to be constructed over more than eight years. This move is part of a broader push by Beijing to drive economic growth through strategic infrastructure investments.</p>

          <p>A photo essay revisits the historic vaccination campaign against polio in the United States during the 1950s. The article notes that at its peak in 1952, polio paralyzed nearly 21,000 people and caused 3,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. Following the widespread introduction of a vaccine in 1955, cases plummeted to fewer than 100 per year within a decade. The images serve as a powerful reminder of one of the most successful public health initiatives in history, showcasing the collective effort that brought a devastating disease under control and transformed modern medicine.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, addressing the country's ambassadors, outlined a significant shift in Germany's foreign policy, stressing it is more critical than ever. He described a new systemic conflict between liberal democracies and an "axis of autocracies," arguing that Germany can no longer act as if it is an island immune to global upheavals. Merz advocated for an interest-based foreign policy focused on securing markets for Germany's export-driven economy. This marks a move away from a more values-based approach, positioning Germany to take on a larger, more assertive role on the international stage commensurate with its economic strength.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, a Spanish court has sided with residents of the Galicia region who sued local authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The claimants argued that nitrate runoff from farm waste had contaminated drinking water, destroyed the local ecosystem, and violated their human rights. The court ordered authorities to compensate the residents, clean up the polluted river, and implement preventative measures. This case is the first of its kind in Europe and could set a legal precedent for other communities fighting environmental damage from large-scale agriculture.</p>
