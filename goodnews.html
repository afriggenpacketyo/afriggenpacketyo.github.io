          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 05:46:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law prohibiting smoking in public areas where children are present, including parks, beaches, and near schools. The ban, part of a government initiative to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032, imposes fines on violators. While polls show public support for tighter restrictions, the measure has drawn criticism for being excessive and for excluding e-cigarettes. The policy aims to reduce the high smoking rate and associated public health costs in a country where cigarette smoking is deeply ingrained in the culture.</p>

          <p>UEFA has delayed its ruling on whether Crystal Palace can compete in the upcoming Europa League season. The club's eligibility is in question due to multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a stake in French club Lyon. Textor has agreed to sell his stake in Palace to resolve the issue. The decision is now pending the outcome of Lyon's appeal against their relegation to Ligue 2, as Lyon has agreed to forfeit its Europa League spot if the appeal fails.</p>

          <p>Trade talks between Canada and the U.S. are set to resume after the Canadian government canceled its planned Digital Services Tax. The tax, which would have levied a 3% charge on the Canadian revenue of large tech firms, was strongly opposed by President Trump, who had suspended negotiations over the issue. Prime Minister Mark Carney's administration announced the reversal to facilitate progress on a new economic and security agreement. This move is seen by some analysts as a concession to U.S. pressure but is framed by Canadian officials as a necessary step to advance vital trade discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

To protect its data, Reddit is suing AI company Anthropic for unfair business practices while also licensing its data to partners like Google and OpenAI. Concurrently, Reddit is leveraging AI for its own "Reddit Answers" feature, which provides summaries based solely on its platform's discussions. CEO Steve Huffman believes the authentic human conversations on Reddit will remain valuable and distinct from the "sterile answers from AI."</p>

          <p>Patient advocates and medical experts offer guidance on supporting a friend with a cancer diagnosis, emphasizing that presence and listening are paramount. They advise against disappearing due to discomfort, as social isolation can be more painful than the treatments. Instead of offering unsolicited advice or platitudes, it's better to ask if the person wants to talk and then simply listen without judgment. When offering help, being specific, such as offering to bring a particular meal on a certain day, is more effective than a vague "let me know if you need anything."</p>

          <p>Homicide rates across the United States are falling dramatically in 2024, with some analyses showing a drop of at least 14%. Researchers suggest this decline is linked to the nation's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. They theorize that the 2020 crime surge was partly driven by the shutdown of public services, schools, and community centers, which are vital support systems for at-risk youth. As local government employment and spending have returned to pre-pandemic levels, these services have been restored, helping to interrupt cycles of violence.</p>

          <p>England's Beth Mead and the Netherlands' Vivianne Miedema, who are partners off the field, are set to compete against each other at the Women's European Championship. Their national teams have been drawn in the same group, a development Mead described as "inevitable." Both players, who are highly competitive, are returning to a major tournament after recovering from ACL injuries that caused them to miss the 2023 World Cup.

The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born wrestler to reach the sport's highest rank since 2017. His rapid rise after just 13 tournaments has made him a star, and he hopes a strong performance will bring energy to his hometown of Tsubata, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.
