          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that the company's $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector, part of a larger "Tech Prosperity Deal" with the US, could boost the UK economy by 10% within five years. The deal involves investments from Google and Nvidia in British-based infrastructure, particularly data centers, and Microsoft's involvement in a new supercomputer in Essex. Nadella emphasized the potential of AI to drive economic and GDP growth, comparing it to the impact of the personal computer in the workplace. The UK government anticipates the deal will create skilled jobs and benefit the entire country. Optimism surrounds the economic benefits of AI, balanced with concerns about energy consumption and over-hype. Optimism is tempered by warnings from groups like Foxglove about the UK potentially footing the bill for the power needed for these tech investments. </p>

          <p>NPR plans to trim over $5 million from its budget without layoffs or major programming changes due to financial uncertainties stemming from congressional defunding of public media. While listener contributions have increased, NPR executives are unsure how long the generosity will last, as many local member stations struggle. NPR CEO Katherine Maher is offering $8 million in relief to stations hardest hit by the cost of paying for NPR's programs. Some local stations argue they need more help, noting numerous layoffs in public media since the defunding. Despite the challenges, NPR is investing in collaborative reporting and seeking new revenue streams. </p>

          <h2>China's Export Strategy Shifts Focus Away from US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 00:05:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that China is pivoting away from the U.S. in its export strategy, with the city of Yiwu, a major wholesale market, seeing a shift in its customer base towards the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This shift is partly due to the U.S.-China trade war and increased tariffs, leading Chinese suppliers to seek more stable markets. While China's exports to the U.S. have dropped, exports to the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia have surged. However, replacing U.S. orders requires more work for less money, as emerging markets offer lower margins. Despite ongoing trade talks, uncertainties and new fees affecting China-made cargo ships arriving in the U.S. are pushing Chinese suppliers to tap into different markets. </p>
