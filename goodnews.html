          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the strategic importance of the nation's marine economy, urging high-quality development and increased policy support for the sector. In 2024, China's marine gross domestic product surpassed 10 trillion yuan, constituting 7.8% of the national GDP, a milestone officials called a remarkable achievement. This focus comes after decades of investment in marine industries, which are now considered to be entering a significant growth phase. The government's strategy aims to bolster sectors like marine engineering, aquaculture, and maritime transport to enhance overall economic resilience and sustainability.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions delivered a commanding performance, defeating the Queensland Reds 52-12 by scoring eight tries in their tour match in Brisbane. After an initial challenge from the Reds, who led twice in the first half, the Lions established dominance and pulled away decisively. Winger Tommy Freeman scored two tries, and captain Maro Itoje also contributed a try in a strong showing. The comprehensive victory marks the Lions' second consecutive match scoring over fifty points, building momentum for their tour, though a late injury to player Elliot Daly caused some concern.</p>

          <p>An Oregon federal judge has ordered the immediate release of a 24-year-old Mexican migrant, ruling that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully detained him. The man, who had been granted temporary legal status through July 2025, was arrested following a routine asylum hearing and held for nearly a month. The judge found that ICE violated due process by failing to justify the arrest or formally revoke the man's parole status. This case highlights the legal complexities and checks on executive power within the U.S. immigration system, particularly concerning the rights of asylum seekers with valid temporary protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April has spurred a significant increase in refinancing activity among U.S. homeowners. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance applications jumped 7% last week and were 40% higher than the same period last year. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, making it more attractive for existing borrowers to secure lower monthly payments. In contrast, demand for mortgages to purchase new homes remained flat, indicating that while lower rates motivate refinancing, broader market uncertainty continues to deter potential homebuyers.

The mission aims to verify technologies that can maintain and extend the operational lifespan of orbiting satellites, a capability the United States has not yet achieved.

While many VTubers are still "puppeteered" by humans, advances in generative AI are making it easier to automate everything from scriptwriting to voice dubbing.

The article's author, navigating the event on crutches, reflects on how a single accessory can fundamentally alter one's experience and movement.

To address economic concerns from some member states, the proposal includes new flexibility, allowing countries to use carbon credits from outside the EU to count toward their targets.

While Tuesday was the hottest day of the year so far in London, temperatures are now significantly lower, with some areas dropping by more than 10¬∞C. Forecasters do not expect a return to heatwave conditions in the first half of July, with temperatures remaining in the mid-to-high teens and low 20s.
