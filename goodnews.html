          <p>NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre has endorsed former coach Jon Gruden to become the new head coach for the University of Arkansas football team, following the firing of Sam Pittman. Favre praised Gruden's sharp football mind, energy, and passion, suggesting he would be a "spark" for the program. Gruden, who has been out of coaching since an email scandal ended his tenure with the Las Vegas Raiders, has previously expressed a strong desire to return to coaching, particularly in the SEC. The endorsement adds a high-profile name to the speculation surrounding the Razorbacks' coaching search.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz won his eighth title of the season, defeating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in the final of the Japan Open in Tokyo. Alcaraz overcame an ankle injury he sustained early in the tournament to continue his dominant season, which now includes nine consecutive finals appearances. Despite a strong start, Fritz struggled with a thigh injury during the match, receiving a medical timeout in the second set. Alcaraz capitalized on his opponent's limited mobility to secure the victory, further solidifying his position as the top player in men's tennis.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a Gaza ceasefire plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. A source close to the negotiations indicated that a formal response will be presented to mediators on Wednesday. The 20-point proposal includes a swift ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim Palestinian administration overseen by an international board. The plan has received public support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Palestinian Authority, and several key Muslim-majority nations, signaling a potential diplomatic breakthrough in the long-running conflict.</p>

The event, "Chaos in the Ring," aims to tap into what Khan sees as an "untouched market" for the sport in Africa. This follows a smaller debut card he promoted in Ghana earlier this year. Khan hopes to use his extensive experience as a fighter who headlined major shows to build trust and create opportunities for fighters, with a focus on bringing them back to their ancestral roots.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is actively working to integrate artificial intelligence across its entire operation, with the goal of becoming a "fully AI-connected enterprise." The bank has developed an internal platform, LLM Suite, to harness large language models for tasks ranging from drafting emails to creating investment banking presentations in seconds. The vision includes providing every employee with a personal AI assistant and automating internal processes, which could fundamentally reshape the workforce. While the bank believes this will boost productivity and create a competitive advantage, it also raises questions about the future of junior roles and the apprenticeship model in finance.

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on their journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew" with a superficial understanding of their heritage to discovering the depth and richness of Jewish tradition. They initially saw Judaism as obsolete and defined by a handful of holidays and the Holocaust. Through study, they found a tradition rooted in debate, questioning, and a wide range of spiritual conceptions, contrary to the legalistic caricature they once believed. The author concludes that their former, apologetic Jewish identity was shaped by centuries of anti-Semitism and assimilation, and that a deeper knowledge of the tradition is an empowering response to rising Jew hatred.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations has been reached, creating a new entity to comply with a 2024 law aimed at divesting the app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The new company would be controlled by a group of U.S. investors, including Oracle, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell, who would oversee a new algorithm retrained on U.S. user data. While Trump claims the deal has the blessing of Chinese President Xi Jinping, neither ByteDance nor Beijing has publicly confirmed the specifics. The arrangement aims to address national security concerns by walling off U.S. user data and placing control in American hands.</p>
