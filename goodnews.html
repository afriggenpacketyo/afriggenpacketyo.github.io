          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump addressed Israel's parliament, the Knesset, celebrating a new ceasefire agreement that led to the release of all remaining living hostages held by Hamas. In his speech, he described the moment as the "historic dawn of a new Middle East" and urged both sides to translate military victories into lasting peace. The deal, which Trump helped broker, also involves the release of Palestinian prisoners and aims to permanently end the conflict. Trump's reception was largely positive, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praising his leadership.</p>

          <p>Shares of Bloom Energy experienced a significant surge of over 20% after the company announced a major deal with Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield plans to invest up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom's fuel cell technology to provide on-site power for large-scale artificial intelligence data centers. This partnership aims to address the massive energy demands of the AI industry by creating off-grid "AI factories," bypassing the limitations of the aging U.S. electric grid. The collaboration underscores a growing trend of developing independent power solutions to support rapid technological expansion.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, Senate Bill 243, designed to enhance the safety of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots for children. The legislation mandates that chatbot operators implement measures to prevent the generation of content related to suicide or self-harm and provide resources like crisis hotlines. It also requires operators to remind minor users to take breaks and to prevent chatbots from producing sexually explicit material. The bill represents a key step in the state's efforts to regulate emerging AI technologies responsibly while balancing innovation with child protection.</p>

          <p>This article explores the primary drivers of mortgage interest rates, analyzing the distinct roles of the Federal Reserve's policy and the 10-year Treasury yield. While the Fed's rate adjustments influence short-term borrowing costs for banks, experts assert that the 10-year Treasury yield has a more direct and significant impact on long-term mortgage rates. This is because its duration more closely aligns with the average life of a mortgage loan, making it a key benchmark for lenders. The article clarifies that while interconnected, Treasury yields are the more immediate indicator for homebuyers to watch. (not investment advice)</p>

The team is scheduled for friendly matches against Brazil and Australia, but several key players from the victorious Euro 2025 campaign may be absent due to injuries. Captain Leah Williamson and forward Lauren James are confirmed to be unavailable, creating opportunities for other players to step up. Wiegman faces important decisions regarding replacements, particularly in defense, with speculation about a potential recall for former captain Millie Bright.</p>

          <p>As of early October 2025, average interest rates for home loans in the U.S. are approximately 6.49% for a 30-year fixed mortgage and 5.87% for a 15-year term. Refinance rates are closely aligned, with a 30-year refinance averaging 6.52%. While these rates are higher than those seen in previous years, they have decreased from earlier peaks in 2025. Financial experts suggest that prospective borrowers can secure better rates by strengthening their credit profiles and shopping around among different lenders to compare terms and fees.

          <p>A recent survey from FlexJobs indicates that a significant majority of American workers value remote work so highly that they would consider changing jobs if forced to return to the office full-time. The report found that 76% of professionals would look for a new position if their remote work arrangements were revoked, a substantial increase from the previous year. For many, the ability to work remotely is now a top factor in job satisfaction, outweighing even salary for some. This growing sentiment poses a challenge for companies pushing for a full return to in-person work.</p>

This participatory approach is a rare example of a beneficiary community being given direct control over funding decisions. The grants support projects like traditional farming and sustainable food practices to tackle high rates of food insecurity in tribal nations.</p>
