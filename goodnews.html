          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert known for his work on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000.

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have reached a trade agreement, but it includes tariffs, signaling that President Trump's tariff policies are likely to remain in place. While the UK secured some exemptions for its auto, steel, and aluminum sectors, a 10% baseline tariff will apply to most other goods imported from the UK. Analysts interpret this deal as a sign that other countries and trading blocs can expect similar tariff conditions. The agreement allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, indicating a cap on market share for some British automakers.</p>
