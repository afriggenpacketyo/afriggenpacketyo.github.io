          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2bn upgrade project. Initially drawn up in 1990 and begun in 2002, the 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges, and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While some criticize the cost and delays, others believe the upgrade will generate jobs and better connect communities.</p>

While denying any presidential aspirations for 2028, they highlighted the need to focus on immediate challenges and deliver tangible alternatives to the opposition.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the UN's global population estimates may be undercounting individuals in rural areas by over 50%, potentially increasing the total world population by hundreds of millions or even billions. This discrepancy arises from incomplete or unreliable census data outside major cities in the global south. While some express concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity, the article argues that anxieties often reflect power struggles over whose lives matter. The author suggests that managing consumption responsibly and developing sustainable technologies are key to avoiding catastrophic outcomes, advocating for compromise and sharing resources.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence spending by 2034, with the upcoming strategic defence review based on this assumption. The review, expected to outline priorities for military and security spending, will address new threats like drones and artificial intelligence. The government's budget watchdog estimates meeting the 3% target would require an additional ¬£17.3 billion in 2029-30. The defence ministry also announced over ¬£1.5bn in additional funding to improve military housing, addressing urgent repairs and developing new accommodations.</p>

Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at a lower price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The rice sold out quickly at an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, with long lines forming at a home center operated by Iris Ohyama in Sendai.

Saigo, who already won the Chevron Championship, holds a three-stroke advantage over a group of six, including Nelly Korda. Korda had her best round ever at the US Women's Open with a 67.
