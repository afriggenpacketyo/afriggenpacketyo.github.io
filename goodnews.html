          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm made a deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono services. The president's initial executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz and for taking on a pro bono case related to the January 6 Capitol riot. Other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional. This article details the departures and the controversy surrounding the firm's agreement with the Trump administration.</p>
