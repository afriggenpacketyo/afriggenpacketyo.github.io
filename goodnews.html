He emphasized creating a differentiated product with superior video quality and innovative features, suggesting Apple's current MLB deal was a learning experience for larger, global league partnerships in the future.</p>

The company plans to sell 25 million shares, aiming to raise as much as $825 million, even as a government shutdown threatens to slow IPO market activity. Beta Technologies, which has yet to turn a profit, joins other electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft makers like Joby and Archer in going public.

          <p>The Trump administration has arranged for FBI agents to be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown that has halted pay for most federal workers. FBI Director Kash Patel announced the development, though the specific source of the funds was not disclosed. This decision follows a similar move to ensure military service members receive their paychecks using unspent funds from the previous fiscal year. The FBI Agents Association expressed gratitude but noted that other essential FBI staff, such as analysts, are not covered and called for an end to the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries will continue to receive their monthly payments during the U.S. government shutdown because the program is funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has warned that customer service operations could be disrupted. With nearly 10% of its workforce furloughed, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards will be halted. Additionally, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, which might postpone the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for recipients.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock increased by as much as 5% after the company projected annual revenue to exceed $60 billion by 2030, surpassing analyst expectations. The software company also forecasted an organic revenue growth rate of over 10% from fiscal year 2026 through 2030, signaling a reacceleration of growth. Executives expressed confidence in their AI-powered Agentforce software to drive future sales, countering investor concerns about competition from AI code-generation tools.

          <h2>Experts Affirm Air Travel Safety During Shutdown Despite Risk of Delays</h2>

          <p>Aviation experts assert that flying remains safe during the U.S. government shutdown, even as staffing shortages among air traffic controllers may lead to increased flight delays. Key safety personnel are required to work, and the FAA implements precautionary measures like slowing down air traffic to maintain safety standards. Although unpaid workers may experience stress, experts emphasize that pilots, who are not federal employees, have the final authority and would not fly if they perceived any safety risks. Travelers are advised to be patient, as the primary impact of the shutdown will be on service and scheduling rather than safety.</p>

          <p>The Oklahoma State Department of Education, under its new superintendent Lindel Fields, is rescinding a controversial mandate that required public schools to place Bibles in classrooms and integrate them into lesson plans. The previous directive, issued by former Superintendent Ryan Walters, had prompted lawsuits from civil rights groups and was largely ignored by school districts. The department now plans to file a motion to dismiss the pending legal challenges, stating that decisions on using the Bible for instruction are best left to individual districts and that taxpayer funds should be used for other resources.</p>

Rodriguez spends two to three days a week in Atlanta, with each one-way trip taking four to six hours, which he uses for work, reading, and studying. He views the intentionality required for his commute as a positive alternative to the autopilot nature of daily driving.</p>

          <p>American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison has successfully completed the first-ever ski descent of the Hornbein Couloir on the North Face of Mount Everest. After scattering the ashes of his late partner, Hilaree Nelson, at the summit, Morrison navigated the extremely steep and dangerous route, reaching the base in just over four hours. The descent, which is technically demanding and prone to avalanches, required him to abseil down a 200-meter section of bare rock. This historic achievement was Morrison's third attempt and serves as a tribute to Nelson, who died in a mountaineering accident in 2022.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state will begin offering insulin pens for $11 each through its own pharmaceutical label starting January 1. The initiative aims to make the life-saving drug more affordable, with pharmacies able to purchase a five-pack for $45 to be sold to consumers at a suggested price of $55. This makes California the first state to sell its own brand of generic drugs, a move intended to drive down healthcare costs for residents, particularly those without insurance who can face costs of over $400 for a vial. The announcement follows recent legislation capping insulin co-pays at $35.</p>
