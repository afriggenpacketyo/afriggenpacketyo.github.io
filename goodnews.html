A 1970s assessment found China at least 20 years behind in science, technology, and industry. However, decades of reform and opening up have propelled China to a leading position in various high-tech sectors, fundamentally altering its global standing. The piece explores how China has effectively flipped the technology script with Europe, raising significant questions about comparative progress and future dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election, aiming to deliver 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as initial promising sites, with each new town expected to contain at least 10,000 homes. Housing Secretary Steve Reed will announce these plans, emphasizing Labour's vision to tackle the housing crisis and stimulate economic growth through large-scale development. This initiative draws inspiration from post-war Labour governments' housing booms, aiming to provide homes fit for modern families.</p>

Researchers observed chimps in Uganda and Ivory Coast consuming fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, an amount equivalent to over half a liter of beer for humans. This groundbreaking finding suggests that regular alcohol consumption may not be solely a human cultural phenomenon but could have much deeper evolutionary roots in our closest relatives.
