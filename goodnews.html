          <p>Tens of thousands participated in the Budapest Pride march, challenging legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. A new "child protection" law was used to ban the event, with attendees facing potential fines and organizers facing imprisonment. Despite the pressure, participants, including EU officials, marched to advocate for LGBTQ rights and protest the restrictive legislation. The event highlighted the growing tension between Hungary's conservative government and civil liberties advocates who seek a more diverse and inclusive society.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the 80th-anniversary peace ceremony for the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. This marks a return for Israel, which was not invited to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza. The city of Nagasaki has adopted a more inclusive approach this year, inviting all diplomatic missions. The decision follows a G7 ambassadorial boycott of the 2024 event in solidarity with Israel, and Russia has also confirmed its attendance for the first time since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

The drugs, with an estimated street value of $132 million, were discovered hidden under containers at the London Gateway port following an intelligence-led operation. The Home Office stated this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the U.K. The bust highlights ongoing efforts by law enforcement to disrupt international drug trafficking networks amid rising cocaine-related deaths in the country.</p>

          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience advises prospective homebuyers to use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a house is the right fit. This guideline suggests that the ideal property will have 80% of the features a buyer loves, 10% of things that can be improved over time, and 10% of flaws they can live with. The agent emphasizes that no house is perfect and that buyers must distinguish between essential needs and wants. This framework can help buyers make more grounded and informed decisions.

          <p>According to Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy, American drivers can expect the cheapest summer for gasoline since 2021, with the national average potentially falling below $3 per gallon by September. A recent price spike, driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to be temporary now that a ceasefire is in place. Typically, summer gas prices decline as refineries increase production and the switch to more expensive summer-blend gasoline is completed. The analysis suggests that, adjusted for inflation, gas prices are near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial planners suggest that outsourcing laundry can be a smart decision if it frees up time for more valuable or joyful activities. To determine if it's worth the cost, they recommend calculating your personal hourly rate; if the service costs less, it's a good trade-off. It's also important to consider the emotional benefit of removing a dreaded chore, which can boost well-being and prevent burnout. However, experts caution that this convenience should not come at the expense of long-term financial goals, such as saving for retirement.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are rapidly moving from a niche crypto asset to a mainstream financial tool, with major corporations like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard integrating them into their payment systems. These firms see stablecoins as a way to slash transaction fees and enable instantaneous, 24/7 settlement. This corporate adoption is bolstered by growing regulatory clarity in Washington, with the Senate passing a bipartisan framework for stablecoin regulation. While some concerns about illicit use remain, the trend indicates a significant shift in how digital value is moved. (not investment advice)</p>
