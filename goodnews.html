          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans have mixed feelings about the Trump administration's deportation program, with support largely dependent on the perceived targets. A majority supports deporting dangerous criminals, but disapproval rises if the program is seen as deporting more people than expected. Concerns about the program's potential negative impact on the economy also exist, with many believing it will weaken rather than strengthen it. The poll also reveals that views on the national economy have stabilized, but support for new tariffs remains net negative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles to resolve disputes in the South China Sea, emphasizing consultation, co-management, mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposition to external interference.

The report criticizes external actors for fueling regional tensions and undermining maritime cooperation.

          <p>An opinion piece in the South China Morning Post suggests that the threat of 'peaceful evolution' from the US has diminished for China. The author recalls being taught to be wary of American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party. However, China has since become a major economic power, while the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts. The author contends that the US no longer lectures other countries on how to govern, reducing the perceived threat.</p>
