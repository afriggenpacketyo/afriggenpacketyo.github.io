          <p>The Supreme Court has intervened in President Trump's deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants facing expulsion. The court criticized the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, highlighting that this did not meet due process requirements. Legal scholars have praised the courts for upholding constitutional principles, while expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding the administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and the judiciary's role in safeguarding immigrants' rights.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. This comes ahead of a summit between the UK and the EU. The scheme aims to strengthen partnerships with the EU, benefiting jobs, bills, and borders. However, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has voiced concerns, describing the scheme as 'free movement through the back door,' while Reform UK echoes similar sentiments, emphasizing the need to avoid uncapped migration schemes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that it would have to raise prices due to tariffs. Trump urged Walmart and China to 'EAT THE TARIFFS' instead of charging customers higher prices. Walmart CFO John David Rainey noted that the company has not seen price increases of this magnitude before and that the retailer will try to absorb some of the higher costs. Other companies, such as Microsoft and Mattel, have also announced price increases or warned of potential increases due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is launching its Memorial Day outdoor sales event, a crucial period for home improvement retailers, offering significant discounts on plants, landscaping materials, grills, and patio furniture. In fiscal year 2024, garden sales contributed $20.83 billion, about 13% of Home Depot's total revenue. Analysts anticipate a challenging first quarter due to unfavorable weather and weak consumer sentiment, but stronger outdoor sales and a recovering housing market could boost performance. The retailer remains cautious due to tariff uncertainty, but CEO Ted Decker is confident in the company's ability to navigate the situation. (not investment advice)</p>
