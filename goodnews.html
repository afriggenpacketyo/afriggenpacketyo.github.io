          <p>Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, successfully launched its 13th passenger flight, sending six more tourists to the edge of space and back. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from West Texas, carrying the crew to an altitude just above 65 miles, where they experienced several minutes of weightlessness. Among the passengers was Owolabi Salis, who became the first Nigerian to fly in space. The entire sub-orbital journey lasted about 10 minutes, with both the reusable booster and the passenger capsule landing safely, marking another milestone for the space tourism company.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached for a "group of very wealthy people" to acquire the U.S. operations of the social media app TikTok. Speaking to Fox News, Trump stated he would reveal the buyer in about two weeks and suggested that the deal would likely require and receive approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes after the Trump administration ordered TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. assets over national security concerns, extending the deadline for a sale multiple times.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its powerful "Ernie" generative AI model open source, a move that could significantly disrupt the global AI landscape. This decision puts pressure on proprietary models from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic by offering a highly competitive, low-cost alternative for developers. While some experts believe it will accelerate innovation and lower costs for consumers, others raise security concerns about the widespread adoption of a Chinese-developed AI infrastructure. The move is seen as a declaration of a price war, potentially altering the business models of major AI players.</p>

          <p>LeBron James will make NBA history by becoming the first person to play 23 seasons in the league. The Lakers superstar exercised his $52.6 million player option to return to the team for the 2025-26 season, as confirmed by his agent. At 40 years old, James breaks his tie with Vince Carter for the most seasons played and is also approaching Robert Parish's record for the most regular-season games played. This decision solidifies a key piece of the Lakers' roster as the team looks to address other needs in free agency.</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated boxing rematch between British fighters Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn has been scheduled for September 20 in London. The fight follows their thrilling April bout, which Eubank Jr won by unanimous decision. That first encounter, held 35 years after their famous fathers first fought, was marked by a contentious build-up, including a cancelled 2022 fight due to a failed drug test by Benn. Promoter Eddie Hearn noted the rematch is even bigger than the first sell-out event, with a venue like Wembley Stadium being considered.</p>

          <p>The racing drama "F1 The Movie," starring Brad Pitt, debuted at the top of the box office with an impressive $55.6 million in North America, marking the biggest opening weekend for an Apple-produced film. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, the movie exceeded expectations and also brought in $88 million internationally, powered by the global appeal of Formula One. Despite its strong start and positive "A" CinemaScore from audiences, the film's reported $200 million-plus budget means it still has a long road to profitability, but it represents a significant theatrical success for Apple.</p>

          <p>A heavily pregnant Alsatian-cross dog, abandoned on a remote fell in Lancashire, has been successfully rescued and has since given birth to seven healthy puppies. The dog, named Elsa by her rescuers, was found exhausted and starving on Longridge Fell. A coordinated effort between the local council's dog warden and volunteers from a lost dog rescue group led to her safe capture using a humane trap. She was taken to a local kennel where she gave birth two days later, and both mother and pups are now thriving in the care of the Dogs Trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, mistakenly notified "several thousand" Eurojackpot players that they had won millions of kroner. The error was caused by a faulty currency conversion from Eurocents to Norwegian kroner, which multiplied the prize amounts by 100 instead of dividing. The company corrected the amounts the next day and confirmed no incorrect payouts were made, but the mistake led to widespread anger and disappointment. The CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, has since apologized for the "breach of trust" and resigned from her position following the incident.</p>
