          <p>The UK government is expected to announce a significant compromise on its proposed changes to benefits. According to multiple sources, the deal with over 100 Labour backbenchers will protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from cuts. This agreement represents a major policy reversal for the government, which was facing a potential defeat in Parliament. The new plan is also expected to accelerate the timeline for support programs designed to help people return to employment.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's upcoming July deadlines for reimposing widespread tariffs on imports are not rigid and could be extended. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president has the authority to grant extensions or propose reciprocal tariff rates if countries do not reach trade agreements with the U.S. by the specified dates. This signaling of flexibility, also echoed by other administration economic advisors, has been interpreted as a move to allow more time for ongoing negotiations with multiple countries.

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at American Vogue after 37 years. While she will no longer be the day-to-day editor, she will retain her influential positions as Vogue's global editorial director and as chief content officer for parent company Cond√© Nast. The U.S. edition of the magazine will now recruit a new "head of editorial content," a structure already in place at other international Vogue editions. This change allows Wintour to focus more on her global and corporate oversight responsibilities.</p>

          <p>After a period of decline earlier in the year, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently risen, but there are several opportunities for them to fall again this summer. Key dates to watch include the release of the June inflation report on July 15, as a drop in inflation could prompt lenders to lower rates. The Federal Reserve's meetings on July 29 and September 17 are also critical, with the September meeting considered the most likely time for the central bank to announce its first rate cut in months.

          <p>Microsoft is retiring one of its most infamous and long-standing features: the "blue screen of death" (BSOD). The company announced that the error screen, which has signaled critical system failures on Windows computers since the early 1990s, will be replaced with a black version in the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update. The change is part of a broader effort to streamline the unexpected restart experience for users.

          <p>Signs placed in U.S. national parks, prompted by a Trump administration executive order, have asked visitors to report any exhibits or information they find "negative about past or living Americans." However, a review of submitted comments reveals that the public is largely using the feedback system to reject the premise of the request. Many respondents are arguing for the importance of telling the complete, and sometimes difficult, history of the nation. Critics of the initiative also raise concerns that the open feedback system could be manipulated by ideologically motivated groups, regardless of historical accuracy.</p>

          <p>For savers considering where to place a significant deposit, this article compares the potential interest earnings of short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. With a $10,000 deposit, a 3-month or 6-month CD currently offers slightly higher returns than a high-yield savings account over the same period. However, for a 9-month term, the high-yield savings account comes out marginally ahead. The choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate changes, as CDs lock in a fixed rate while savings account rates are variable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico's Supreme Court has delivered a landmark ruling in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, who was in an abusive relationship with a much older producer, Luis de Llano, when she was a 14-year-old pop star. The court upheld a civil conviction against de Llano for moral damages, denying his appeal. Crucially, the decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in civil cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, opening a new path to justice for other victims.
