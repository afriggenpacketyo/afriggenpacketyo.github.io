          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, are part of a national strategy to enhance resource security amid a global race for critical minerals. Investment in mineral exploration saw a substantial year-on-year increase, particularly for elements like tin, bauxite, and copper, which are vital for the aerospace, semiconductor, and green energy sectors. The government plans to continue advancing strategic prospecting to bolster its national energy and mineral resource security.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in a seven-mile-long wastewater tunnel under construction, with the collapse happening miles from the only access point. Four workers entered the tunnel to help their 27 trapped colleagues before the Los Angeles Fire Department's Urban Search and Rescue teams arrived. Fortunately, none of the workers sustained visible injuries, managing to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape. The project has been halted indefinitely as Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of two men convicted for the "Hillside Strangler" serial murders in the 1970s, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were responsible for the murders of 12 women in Los Angeles and Washington state, often impersonating police officers to lure their victims. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, a California parole board determined Bianchi remains a risk and will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Buono was sentenced to life without parole and died in prison in 2002, while Bianchi is serving his sentence in Washington state.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The meteorite, weighing just over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceedingly rare, comprising less than 1% of all meteorites found on Earth. The auction provides a unique opportunity for a private collector to own a significant piece of the red planet.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science, known for its dinosaur exhibits, has made a remarkable discovery directly on its property. A fossilized vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur was found in a narrow borehole drilled over 750 feet deep under the museum's parking lot during a geothermal energy study. Curators described the find as incredibly rare, likening it to a "hole in one from the moon." The bone is believed to be from the late Cretaceous period, around 67.5 million years ago. While not scientifically groundbreaking, the unlikely discovery has generated excitement and is now on display for museum visitors to see.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day the company's market capitalization closed above $4 trillion for the first time. The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it comes as Nvidia grapples with the administration's export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to the Chinese market. The U.S. government has cited national security for these restrictions, which have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to China and impacted billions in planned orders. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post, linking its rise to his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The iconic red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds. The famed cabaret and nightclub celebrated the restoration with a special street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display. The original 12-meter wings collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but no one was injured. While new blades were installed in time for the Paris Olympics, delays with a new electric motor kept them motionless until now. The return of the moving sails restores a beloved symbol of Parisian nightlife.</p>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for creating the perfect political slogan by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. The research highlights eight key words that resonate emotionally with voters across cultures: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. While not a guarantee of victory, these words act as "emotional shortcuts." The book contrasts these universally appealing terms with more "bespoke" slogans like "Get Brexit Done," which are effective for single-issue campaigns. The analysis also notes the trend towards AI-crafted, micro-targeted messages, which may eventually replace traditional, broad-based slogans.</p>

The application to the Arizona Department of Transportation covers operations with and without human safety drivers. This move follows Tesla's recent pilot launch in Austin, Texas, where invited passengers ride in remotely supervised vehicles with an in-car safety supervisor. While Tesla aims to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, its Austin pilot has faced some issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on video. The company also plans to expand its service to the San Francisco Bay Area soon.</p>

According to his agent, the injury was minor, and the prized free-agent signing is fully expected to be ready for the start of the upcoming NFL season. Harris, who has four consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons, was signed to a one-year deal to bolster the Chargers' running game. He is expected to form a key partnership in the backfield with first-round draft pick Omarion Hampton as the team aims for a consecutive playoff appearance.</p>

          <p>Despite having the world's lowest birth rate, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This trend reflects a shift in attitudes, as more individuals and couples turn to IVF and egg-freezing to plan their families amid social and financial pressures that delay parenthood. Last year, one in six babies in Seoul was born with the help of fertility treatment. While the national birth rate remains critically low, it saw its first slight increase in nine years in 2024, offering a small glimmer of hope for the country's demographic crisis.</p>

Yaccarino, who had been appointed CEO in May 2023 after Elon Musk's acquisition of the company, did not provide a reason for stepping down.

The company also addressed the impact of U.S. tariffs, stating it plans to absorb some of the increased costs for now to protect consumers, a strategy aided by strong international sales, which account for 60% of its business.
