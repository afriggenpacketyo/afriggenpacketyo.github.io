        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's export growth in May fell short of expectations due to a sharp 34.5% drop in shipments to the U.S., marking the steepest decline since February 2020. This decrease significantly impacted overall exports, although shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa saw increases. Imports also declined by 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while China's trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion. The decline in exports to the U.S. is attributed to tariffs, despite a recent trade truce, and volumes of cars and ship exports increased while smartphones and home appliances decreased.

          <p>China has begun mass production of the world‚Äôs first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge‚Äôs team at Beihang University in Beijing. This innovation merges binary and stochastic logic, enabling enhanced fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications. The new chip overcomes limitations in traditional computing by combining binary numbers with probability-based numbers, potentially bypassing U.S. chip restrictions. The development addresses challenges related to power consumption and communication with traditional systems.</p>
