          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, effectively banning the sale of EU citizenship in exchange for investments. The court found that Malta's policy made nationality a "mere commercial transaction" and undermined the solidarity and mutual trust between EU member states. While this ruling ends passport sales, "golden visas" offering residence permits for investments remain in place in many EU countries. Anti-corruption advocates hope the momentum from this decision will lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of these "golden visa" programs.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships choose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, highlights that this issue is particularly prevalent among those in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing the surname law as a deterrent to marriage. Many in this age group expressed a willingness to legally marry if separate surnames were permitted, revealing a significant impact of the law on marriage decisions.
