        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart is spearheading a new wave of Chinese consumer brands aiming for a significant global presence, driven by the international popularity of its Labubu dolls. The company's CEO, Wang Ning, stated a new ambition to become "the world's Pop Mart," shifting from an earlier goal of being "China's Disney." Revenue from outside mainland China surged by over 375% last year, and overseas sales are projected to surpass domestic sales this year. This success reflects a broader strategic shift in China from merely exporting products to establishing and promoting its own globally recognized brands.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a historic free trade agreement (FTA) projected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long term. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and alcohol. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods exported to the U.K. will be tariff-free, while 92% of British exports to India will see duties removed or reduced. This landmark pact between the world's fifth and sixth largest economies is expected to enhance economic growth and strengthen their strategic positions in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish top-flight club Brommapojkarna has earned a reputation as one of Europe's most effective talent factories, producing high-profile players like Viktor Gyokeres, Dejan Kulusevski, and Lucas Bergvall. Despite its small fan base, the club, which is the largest in Europe by number of youth teams, thrives on a unique, integrated coaching system that seamlessly transitions players from the academy to the senior team. Its success relies on developing local talent from the Stockholm area and selling them on, with transfer income being the club's primary revenue source. The article highlights how this model has become a foundation for many of Sweden's top professional footballers.</p>

          <p>This article examines several key narratives surrounding the WNBA in 2025, particularly in the context of Caitlin Clark's arrival and the league's growth. It debunks the idea that the league is overly dependent on Clark, pointing to strong attendance for expansion teams and the presence of other generational talents like Paige Bueckers and JuJu Watkins. The analysis also dismisses the notion that a lack of dunking holds the league back, highlighting the WNBA's strong fundamentals and high-level passing game. However, it acknowledges that debates around refereeing standards persist, as player and coach criticisms continue amid high-stakes, physical games.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.9% in June, a rebound attributed to a spell of hot weather that encouraged consumer spending. According to the Office for National Statistics, the warm temperatures boosted fuel sales as more people traveled, and supermarkets saw increased purchases of drinks and summer-related items. Sales of clothing also benefited from the weather and seasonal promotions. Despite the monthly increase, the overall trend suggests a loss of momentum in retail spending, with only a 0.2% rise in the second quarter, indicating that economic growth may have remained lackluster.

          <p>As England prepares to face world champions Spain in the Euro 2025 final, this article analyzes the key tactical challenges the Lionesses must overcome. A central issue will be disrupting Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot Patri Guijarro and containing Ballon d'Or winners Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas. England may find success by exploiting Spain's high defensive line with direct passes and counter-attacks, a strategy that Germany used effectively in the semi-final. The performance of England's forwards, like Alessia Russo, and the impact of substitutes will be crucial in a match where Spain is expected to dominate possession.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland offers the United Kingdom an opportunity to solidify key aspects of its recent trade deal with the United States. While in the UK, Trump is scheduled to have an informal meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to refine the pact, which still has some elements in the commitment stage. Unfinished business includes the removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum and resolving disputes over a digital services tax. Analysts suggest a potential trade-off could see the U.S. drop metal tariffs in exchange for the U.K. removing its tech tax, strengthening bilateral relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With an August 1 deadline looming for a trade deal with the United States before tariffs increase, India appears unfazed, according to analysts. India has successfully protected sensitive sectors like agriculture in other recent trade pacts, such as its deal with the U.K., and is expected to maintain this stance with the U.S. Strategically, Washington has an interest in finalizing an agreement with India, viewing the nation as a crucial partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. This geopolitical positioning, along with India's multi-alignment strategy in forging other trade deals, gives New Delhi significant leverage in the negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France has released Georges Abdallah, a 74-year-old Lebanese militant, after he spent 41 years in prison, making him one of the longest-serving prisoners in Europe for acts linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abdallah, a co-founder of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions, was convicted in 1987 for complicity in the murders of a U.S. and an Israeli diplomat in Paris. Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, which supporters attributed to U.S. and Israeli pressure. Following a court ruling that his detention was "disproportionate," he was freed and immediately put on a flight to Beirut.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Tour de France have been forced to shorten and reroute Stage 19 of the race to avoid a herd of cattle affected by contagious nodular dermatitis. The decision was made after an outbreak was discovered on the Col des Saisies, one of the planned climbs. To prevent any risk and out of respect for the affected farmers, the stage was cut from 130km to 95km, bypassing two climbs. The race will now start an hour later than originally scheduled, with riders rejoining the original route after the affected area, as the three-week event nears its conclusion in Paris.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Football Association (FA) chief executive Mark Bullingham has stated that there is no need to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. Responding to reports that the sport's law-making body, Ifab, might consider using VAR for decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards, Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the game. The FA, which holds a vote on Ifab, has made its opposition clear, signaling that any proposal to widen VAR's scope would likely face resistance from key stakeholders who believe the current balance is appropriate.</p>

          <p>This article provides reviews for several new films, with a focus on Marvel's 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps.' Directed by Matt Shakman of "WandaVision" fame, the movie is praised for its 1960s kitsch aesthetic and for being a self-contained story that doesn't rely on prior MCU knowledge. The review highlights the convincing CGI depiction of the cosmic entity Galactus and well-filmed, non-excessive action sequences. Also reviewed are Kiyoshi Kurosawa's psychological thriller "Cloud," about an online reseller's descent into paranoia, and Giovanni Tortorici's debut feature "Diciannove," a frustrating yet faithful portrayal of teenage confusion and identity.</p>

          <p>In a UK first, people in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining food on prescription from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving individuals more choice and flexibility to buy approved items at supermarkets, shops, and online. While the move is praised for its convenience, some participants from a pilot scheme noted that the allotted funds only scratch the surface of the higher costs associated with a mandatory gluten-free diet.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels more refreshed than he has in a long time as he enters his fourth season, despite mounting pressure to win after a 7-6 campaign. Riley attributes his calmer offseason to having a more established program and a new general manager handling personnel matters, allowing him to unplug. He believes the team is close to turning a corner, citing improved defensive depth and talent as key areas of progress. Despite a decline in wins over his first three seasons, Riley expressed confidence that the program has momentum, pointing to the nation's top-ranked 2026 recruiting class.</p>
