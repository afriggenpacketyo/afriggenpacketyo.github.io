          <h2>Trump Plans to Officially Rename Persian Gulf to Arabian Gulf</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intends to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. This decision follows pressure from Arab nations seeking to change the geographic name of the body of water, while Iran maintains its historical ties to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. military has already been using the term Arabian Gulf in its statements, and while Trump can change the name for U.S. purposes, he cannot dictate global usage. The article highlights the sensitivity of the issue, especially for Iranians who embrace their country‚Äôs history as the Persian Empire.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans after a five-year pause, which includes tools like the Treasury Offset Program and wage garnishment. Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with millions more at risk of defaulting soon, and the Education Department will notify borrowers about the resumption of collections. Borrowers can check their loan status and servicer information through their online Federal Student Aid account. There are options available for borrowers to get their loans out of default, such as paying the loan in full, rehabilitating the loan, or consolidating the loan.</p>

IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology, aligning with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminium industry.</p>

The effort was unsuccessful, and Musk lost an appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property at a public zoning meeting.
