          <p>Former President Joe Biden, during an appearance on ABC's "The View," expressed that he was not surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris's loss in the 2024 presidential election, attributing it to sexism and racism. Biden stated that there was a consistent campaign to undercut the notion that a woman, particularly a woman of mixed race, could lead the country. He also mentioned that he and Harris have a close relationship and communicate frequently, and sidestepped questions about her future political ambitions, though he hopes she stays engaged in politics. Progressive figures have criticized Biden for being in denial about the Democratic party's viability in 2024.</p>

          <p>Keen, a U.S. shoe company based in Portland, Oregon, has pledged not to raise prices despite new U.S. tariffs on imports. The company has been diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. While other companies are expected to hike prices, Keen operates plants in multiple countries and works with manufacturing partners to spread costs, allowing them to absorb tariff-related expenses. This approach helps Keen maintain stable prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal court panel has ruled that Alabama's redistricting plan intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating the Voting Rights Act. The judges found that the state legislature deliberately diluted Black voting strength. This ruling follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision that Alabama's 2021 congressional map was discriminatory. The court also suggested Alabama be subjected to federal preclearance for future districting plans. The Black voters who sued hailed the decision as a victory for voting rights.</p>
