          <p>President Trump underwent a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, his second such examination in six months. A memo from the president's physician stated that advanced imaging and laboratory tests showed exceptional results, with stable metabolic and cardiac parameters. The report noted his cardiovascular vitality was akin to someone 14 years younger, and he received his annual flu and updated COVID-19 vaccinations. The White House affirmed that the 79-year-old president continues to demonstrate excellent overall health ahead of a planned trip to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive timeline reveals the key moments in the months-long negotiations that culminated in the recent Israel-Hamas peace deal. The process involved critical interventions by U.S. envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who worked with officials from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey to refine a 20-point plan. A pivotal moment included an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Qatar for a previous airstrike, which helped rebuild trust. The negotiations, which intensified in Sharm El Sheikh, ultimately led to a phased agreement for a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her persistent efforts to promote democracy in her country. In an interview, Machado stated the award sends a message to the Venezuelan people that the world recognizes their struggle and they are not alone. Known as Venezuela's "Iron Lady," she has been a prominent figure challenging the authoritarian regimes of both Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. Despite living in hiding due to threats of arrest, she remains a symbol of defiance and hope for a democratic future in Venezuela.</p>

As China shifts its focus toward technological self-sufficiency and advanced manufacturing, Hong Kong must evolve its financial frameworks to support these sectors. Wang emphasizes that the city has historically thrived by meeting China's financing needs and must now create specialized systems to attract capital for global technology companies. This strategic pivot is seen as a crucial opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

Head coach Brendan King realized his team had actually lost the final game by one point, contrary to the official score that declared them winners. Despite league rules stating the final score is unchangeable, the team unanimously decided to relinquish the title. The act of sportsmanship was praised by the opposing team, Apache High School, who were then awarded the championship.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five military horses that bolted through central London last year, has been officially retired from service due to his injuries. The Household Cavalry horses were spooked by construction noise, leading to a chaotic incident where they ran loose and collided with vehicles. While the other four horses have recovered and returned to duty, Quaker's injuries necessitated his retirement to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. His rider, who was thrown and broke his back, has since recovered and resumed his duties after a year.</p>

          <p>In a rare instance of international cooperation, authorities from China, the United States, and Thailand have seized a record amount of methamphetamine from a vessel in the South China Sea. Acting on a tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Thai police, the China Coast Guard intercepted the ship, confiscating nearly 5,000 kilograms of the drug and arresting seven suspects. The operation is being hailed as the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. The three nations have agreed to continue their collaboration to dismantle drug trafficking networks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reached a deal with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to lower prescription drug prices, similar to a recent agreement with Pfizer. Under the arrangement, AstraZeneca will offer some of its drugs to Medicaid patients at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates in other developed countries, in exchange for avoiding tariffs. The company will also list medications on the government's new "TrumpRx" website. While the administration touts this as a major victory for consumers, some health economists remain skeptical about the deal's actual impact on out-of-pocket costs for most Americans.</p>

          <h2>Psychological Appeal of 'The Traitors' Lies in Its Reflection of Everyday Deception</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular television show 'The Traitors' captivates audiences by tapping into fundamental aspects of human psychology, particularly our relationship with deception and trust. Psychologists suggest the show's game of lying and betrayal mirrors the social dynamics of everyday life, where people must constantly navigate the truthfulness of others. The program serves as a microcosm for observing how cooperation can collapse under pressure and how self-interest often prevails. The celebrity version adds another layer of intrigue, as viewers project their pre-existing beliefs onto public figures, blurring the lines between performance and reality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An in-depth analysis reveals how the Trump administration successfully brokered a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, succeeding where previous efforts failed. The breakthrough was reportedly achieved by leveraging strong personal relationships, applying intense pressure on both sides, and discarding traditional diplomatic protocols. Key factors included President Trump's unpredictable approach, which created a sense of urgency, and a crucial apology from Israel to Qatar that helped reset negotiations. The deal's success is attributed to a combination of Israeli military fatigue, Hamas's degraded capabilities, and a unique, business-oriented negotiation style from U.S. envoys.</p>
