          <p>A strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants has ended after their union, CUPE, reached a tentative agreement with the airline, allowing for the gradual resumption of operations. The walkout, which began over the weekend, caused significant disruptions, affecting hundreds of thousands of travelers daily. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is guaranteed pay for work performed while aircraft are on the ground, a major point of contention for the union. While full service may take over a week to restore, the deal marks a critical step in stabilizing Canada's largest airline.</p>

          <h2>The Resurgence of Matcha's Popularity Analyzed as a Cultural and Social Phenomenon</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent surge in matcha's popularity represents a "second wave," nearly a decade after its initial rise in the mid-2010s, but this time it has achieved mainstream status. The trend is largely driven by social media, where matcha's vibrant green color and the ritual of its preparation are highly "aesthetic" and shareable. Unlike its previous niche appeal, the current boom is also fueled by its perception as a healthier, less jittery alternative to coffee and energy drinks. However, the article suggests its popularity is less about the tea's actual flavor and more about its adaptability, as many consumers enjoy it in highly sweetened lattes.</p>

This acquisition will significantly expand Nexstar's reach, combining its 200-plus stations with Tegna's portfolio. The deal represents a major test for TV station ownership rules under the current Federal Communications Commission, as broadcasters seek consolidation to better compete with large tech and media companies. The combined entity would reach approximately 80% of the U.S. television market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The dietary supplement industry in the United States operates under loose regulation, allowing companies to market products with vague health claims without undergoing rigorous clinical trials for safety or efficacy. This "Wild West" environment was created by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which treats supplements more like food than medicine. Health experts caution that while some supplements like creatine can offer modest benefits under specific conditions, many others, such as collagen, lack convincing scientific support. Consumers are generally advised to obtain nutrients from a healthy diet unless a specific deficiency has been medically diagnosed.</p>

          <p>U.S. families are starting their back-to-school shopping earlier this year, driven by concerns over inflation and the potential impact of tariffs on imported goods like clothing and electronics. According to the National Retail Federation, many households are focusing on essential items and seeking discounts to manage costs, with average spending projected at $858 per family. The cost of school supplies is at a record high, prompting consumers to compare prices, consider refurbished electronics, and opt for store-brand products. Retailers are responding with deep discounts on basic items to attract budget-conscious shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India Walton, the Democratic socialist who won the 2021 Democratic primary for mayor of Buffalo, is advising progressive candidates to maintain their core principles and not move toward the political center. Walton believes that her own attempt to moderate her message after the primary, such as softening her stance on charter schools, ultimately cost her the general election. She argues that the Democratic Party's losses among working-class voters stem from abandoning populist economic policies in favor of a message that appeals more to corporations and wealthy donors. Her advice encourages a bold, unapologetically progressive approach to win over voters.</p>

          <p>Over three decades since its inception, the English Premier League (EPL) has evolved into the world's most dominant and wealthiest club soccer league. Its financial power, with combined revenues exceeding $8.5 billion, allows it to attract top international talent, creating a level of top-to-bottom competitiveness unmatched by other European leagues. This on-field quality drives a massive global broadcast audience and lucrative media deals valued at over $5 billion per season. While other leagues have historically powerful individual clubs, the EPL's relative balance and week-to-week unpredictability are cited as key reasons for its sustained success and global appeal.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in major European soccer clubs, attracted by soaring revenues and valuations. American ownership is now prevalent in England's Premier League, with investors drawn to the sport's rapid financial growth over the past three decades. The limited number of available top-tier sports franchises in the U.S. has made European soccer an appealing alternative for high-net-worth individuals and private equity firms. This trend has also popularized the multi-club ownership model, although it is beginning to face scrutiny from European soccer's governing bodies. (not investment advice)</p>
