          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK) declared its intention to disband and disarm, marking the end of a four-decade insurgency against Turkey, according to this Fox News article. The PKK stated that it has completed its historic mission, which shifted from seeking an independent Kurdish state to advocating for greater Kurdish rights and autonomy within Turkey. Turkey‚Äôs presidential communications director noted that the country will take necessary measures to ensure a smooth transition toward a terror-free environment, while the dissolution raises questions about the future of pro-American Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The U.S. and EU, allied with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and YPG, do not view these groups as affiliated with the PKK, contrasting with Turkey's stance.</p>

          <p>Indian and Pakistani military leaders held talks to extend a cease-fire that halted the most expansive fighting in decades between the two nuclear-armed states, according to this New York Times article. Civilian airports reopened, and stock markets jumped in both nations, signaling confidence in the agreement. Military leaders from both sides discussed measures to ensure neither side fires a single shot or initiates any aggressive action, while also agreeing to consider immediate troop reductions from the borders. President Trump asserted that he threatened both nations with trade consequences to push them toward a cease-fire, though the Indian government has downplayed the U.S. role in brokering the truce.</p>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to drastically reduce tariffs on one another for the next 90 days as they continue to negotiate a more permanent trade deal, providing welcome news for investors, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. The temporary truce will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%, starting Wednesday. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still impact American consumers, and shipping costs are expected to rise as manufacturers attempt to compensate for lost time. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent secured a commitment from China to cut non-tariff barriers, but experts warn that a tough road lies ahead.</p>

          <p>Most flights destined for Newark Liberty International Airport were being delayed at their origin airports by more than an hour and 40 minutes on Monday because of a shortfall in air traffic control staffing, according to this New York Times article. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory about the incoming flight delays from all U.S. airports and some in Canada, while limited staffing, software issues, and runway construction have contributed to lengthy delays at Newark in recent weeks. The Trump administration plans to install new fiber-optic cables connecting the airport and the facility, which was recently moved from Long Island to Philadelphia, and the FAA has convened a task force to address the problems.</p>

Scientists discovered that certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts, opening new questions about the universe. The findings will help scientists better understand how Jupiter's atmosphere works, while Webb previously captured Neptune's glowing auroras in the best detail yet.</p>

President Trump told reporters that, as some of the levies have been suspended rather than cancelled altogether, they might rise again in three months time, if no further progress was made.</p>
