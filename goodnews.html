          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, experienced a successful initial public offering on the Nasdaq, with its stock closing 14.3% higher on its first day of trading. The company raised $425 million after pricing its IPO above the expected range, valuing it at approximately $3.3 billion. Despite posting significant losses in the previous year and the first half of the current year, the strong market debut reflects investor interest in the regulated crypto platform. The Winklevoss brothers, early bitcoin investors, have long advocated for smart regulation in the digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>

Other notable films included “Cover-Up,” a documentary on investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, and “Fuze,” a gripping London-based thriller directed by David Mackenzie.

The discussion reportedly focused on monetary policy and structural changes at the central bank, aligning with the Trump administration's desire for new leadership and operational reforms. Rieder joins a list of candidates that includes former Fed governors and economists. His potential appointment would represent a departure from the tradition of selecting chairs with PhDs in economics, similar to current chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox delivered a widely noted speech calling for civility and an end to political rage. His measured and impassioned remarks, urging Americans to choose a different path than returning hate with hate, stood in stark contrast to the more divisive rhetoric often seen in national politics. Governor Cox, who has a history of promoting bipartisan cooperation, directed his message particularly to young people, acknowledging they are inheriting a country where politics feels dominated by anger. His response is being viewed as a plea for moral leadership at a moment of national crisis.</p>

          <p>The European Commission will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars, according to President Ursula von der Leyen. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who are calling for a relaxation of emissions requirements and more flexibility, including the use of hybrid technologies beyond the deadline. Carmakers cite numerous challenges, including high manufacturing costs, dependency on Asia for batteries, and stiff competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Environmental groups, however, are urging the EU to remain firm on the 2035 phase-out to drive necessary innovation and investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in money market funds, investors are watching closely as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates. While some on Wall Street anticipate a "wall of cash" will move into riskier assets like stocks and bonds as yields on cash-equivalents fall, other experts are skeptical. Analysts note that a significant portion of these funds are held by institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift their strategy. They argue that only a drastic rate cut to near-zero levels, similar to past economic crises, would trigger a substantial outflow from these high-yield savings vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates in the U.S. fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically. Experts emphasize that timing is crucial, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Fed decisions, meaning the best opportunities may be fleeting. Furthermore, securing the lowest rates requires a high credit score, so potential buyers should focus on improving their creditworthiness now. The article also reinforces the importance of getting pre-approved to demonstrate seriousness to sellers and reminds buyers of the adage to prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate.

Powell, known for roles in films like "Ray" and "Rush Hour," stated that he has always prioritized working and providing for his family over agency preferences.
