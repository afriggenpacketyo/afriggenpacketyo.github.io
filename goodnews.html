          <p>President Trump announced the order of 28 new B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, following their recent deployment in Operation Midnight Hammer against three Iranian nuclear facilities. Commanders from the 509th Bomb Wing, which operates these aircraft, described the 36-hour mission as a "perfect" performance, underscoring the B-2's critical role due to its unparalleled combination of long-range capability, high payload, and stealth technology. The mission involved delivering specialized 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, designed for deep underground targets, with F-22 and F-35 tactical fighters providing escort into Iranian airspace.

These automatic protections, which are being rolled out and will be fully implemented by year-end, will default teen accounts to a 13+ setting, with parental permission required to opt out. The restrictions will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent teens from following or interacting with accounts posting age-inappropriate content. Meta is also extending these regulations to its AI technology, seeking to reassure parents about online safety while providing them greater control over their teen's digital interactions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva stated that the global economy's resilience is significantly bolstered by most countries' decision to not retaliate against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. This measured approach has effectively averted a debilitating tariff escalation, contributing to an upward revision of the global GDP growth forecast for 2025. Georgieva noted that the effective U.S. tariff rate has been reduced by trade deals, lessening the overall economic burden. The article also highlights other contributing factors, such as improved national policies fostering private sector development and corporate agility in adjusting supply chains, while cautioning about potential risks from stretched valuations in global markets, particularly within the tech sector.

          <p>A significant three-year study has demonstrated that specially designed group singing classes are clinically effective in treating new mothers grappling with postnatal depression, presenting a potentially cost-effective solution for strained mental health services. The "Melodies for Mums" program, which incorporates a diverse mix of lullabies, folk, and gospel songs, fosters crucial social connection and significantly reduces stress, with participants reporting sustained improvements in their symptoms for months after the sessions conclude. Researchers observed a "nice steady decline" in stress hormone levels among mothers in the singing group and noted an enhanced bond between mothers and their babies. This article highlights the program's success as a viable alternative or complementary therapy, particularly valuable given the long NHS waiting lists for mental health support.</p>
