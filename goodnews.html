          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported that its global sales in May rose by 6.9 percent compared to the previous year, reaching a record high for the month with 898,721 units sold. The company attributed the strong performance largely to a surge in last-minute demand in the United States. This spike in sales was fueled by consumer concerns that car prices would soon increase due to high tariffs potentially being imposed by the U.S. government. In contrast to the sales record, Toyota's global production saw a slight dip of 0.7 percent, its first year-over-year decline in five months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lalo Schifrin, the celebrated Argentine composer behind the iconic theme for "Mission: Impossible," has passed away at the age of 93. Over a career spanning more than six decades, he composed over 100 film and TV soundtracks, earning four Grammy Awards and six Oscar nominations. His distinctive jazzy and percussive style defined scores for classics like "Dirty Harry" and "Cool Hand Luke." In 2018, Schifrin received an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar, where he humorously declared his life's work a "Mission: Accomplished," cementing his legacy as a transformative figure in the art of film scoring.</p>

          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Honor has taken a significant step towards an initial public offering (IPO) by completing its pre-IPO guidance filing with China's securities regulator. This move is a required precursor for companies planning to list on the mainland's A-share market. The decision comes as the A-share market shows signs of recovery in the second quarter, following a sluggish start to the year. According to consulting firm Deloitte, this increased activity reflects the success of regulatory efforts to boost market confidence and improve the quality of new listings, signaling a more favorable environment for companies like Honor to go public.

          <p>A clandestine network of activists in the United Kingdom is illegally releasing beavers into the wild, claiming they are "undoing the damage" of the species' extinction centuries ago. Operating under the cover of darkness, these individuals risk arrest and fines, bypassing the official, bureaucratic licensing process for reintroduction. While the activists champion the ecological benefits of beavers, such as flood mitigation and water purification, the National Farmers Union expresses serious concerns about the unlicensed releases. The unauthorized actions raise issues of potential land damage, disease transmission, and human-wildlife conflict, highlighting a deep divide over rewilding strategies.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has created a high-resolution "digital embryo," providing a powerful new tool for understanding the earliest stages of life. This model maps the intricate process of early organogenesis, the period when a fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types to form organs. This stage is crucial for development but also highly susceptible to defects that can lead to disease. By providing an unprecedented view of this complex process, scientists hope the digital embryo will help decode the fundamental mechanisms of life and offer new insights into preventing developmental abnormalities and related health issues.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, prominent economists argued that China must undergo structural reforms to transition from a production-based to a consumption-driven economy. They cautioned that without a significant increase in domestic consumption, China's reliance on exports could create trade friction not just with the US, but with the entire world. One expert suggested that China will never become a truly rich country unless it becomes a major consumer nation. The panel recommended that local governments should be measured on their success in boosting consumption, a shift that could harmonize global trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is holding its final free community blood testing event for residents affected by January's firestorms. The screening is intended to detect exposure to lead, a neurotoxin often found in the ash and debris of wildfires that burn through urban areas. While soil testing in some burn scars showed elevated lead levels, previous screenings of over 1,500 people have revealed very low levels of contamination in residents. Health officials continue to encourage those affected, especially children and pregnant women who are most vulnerable, to take advantage of the free testing opportunity.</p>

          <p>A host of high-profile celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian, have arrived in Venice, Italy, for the wedding festivities of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez. Guests were seen attending a pre-wedding event on Thursday ahead of the main ceremony scheduled for Saturday. The influx of stars and the scale of the event have not been universally welcomed, sparking some local protests. A campaign called "No Space for Bezos" has emerged, reflecting broader frustrations across Europe with over-tourism and its impact on local costs and communities.</p>
