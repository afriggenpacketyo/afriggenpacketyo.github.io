          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 16:31:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) model, offering short-term, interest-free installment plans, is rapidly gaining popularity among American consumers as an alternative to traditional credit cards. Services like Affirm and Klarna are attracting millions of users, which directly challenges the revenue streams of credit card companies by reducing transaction activity and utilization. However, banks and established financial institutions are wary of the trend, primarily because BNPL loans often do not appear on standard credit reports. This creates what experts call a significant 'black hole' in a consumer's credit profile, making it difficult for lenders to accurately assess creditworthiness and overall financial risk.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Tennessee Titans 33-19, improving their season record to a perfect 2-0. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for two touchdowns, including his first to newly acquired receiver Davante Adams, while Puka Nacua scored on a 45-yard touchdown run. The Rams' defense was also a key factor, with edge rusher Byron Young contributing two sacks and a forced fumble. This victory serves as a final tune-up before the team faces a significant challenge against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The upcoming game is viewed as a true test of the Rams' potential as Super Bowl contenders this season.</p>
