          <p>Following his first-ever Emmy nomination for his role in the series "Shrinking," veteran actor Harrison Ford discussed what continues to drive his long-standing career in Hollywood. The 83-year-old icon stated that his true pleasure comes from the work itself and the "mystery" of not knowing what will happen next on set, rather than from awards or accolades. Ford also recalled early career advice where he was told to change his "pretentious" name and adopt an Elvis Presley haircut, which he famously refused to do.</p>

The statement signals a key European ally's public backing of Trump's diplomatic process, even as the specific details of the proposed peace plan remain contentious.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, including the return of standalone physical stores and a recent catwalk show at London Fashion Week. After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, the brand was acquired by online retailer Asos but now aims to recapture its former glory and its "cool" London aesthetic. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract its former millennial and Gen-Z customers, the brand faces stiff competition from fast-fashion giants and must successfully appeal to a new generation of shoppers to thrive.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes both achieved multiple record closes this week, buoyed by investor speculation about the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. Cooler-than-expected consumer inflation data initially fueled optimism for a rate cut, though a subsequent report showing a rise in wholesale inflation tempered some of the earlier gains. Strong earnings reports and continued high demand within the AI infrastructure sector also contributed to the market's positive performance, lifting several major tech stocks to all-time highs.

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, architect Brian Stark is repurposing old shipping containers to create innovative and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" units are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces, all powered by solar panels. This sustainable and cost-saving approach aims to help tackle the affordable housing crisis by using existing materials to build dignified living spaces in approximately one week.</p>

          <p>Data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reveals a 13% nationwide drop in arrests in July compared to the previous month, slowing the pace of the administration's enforcement actions. While ICE has not officially commented on the reason for the decline, immigrant rights activists believe their efforts, such as "rapid response" hotlines and immediate legal challenges, may be a contributing factor. In states like Oregon, which lacks a long-term ICE detention center, legal strategies and a "sanctuary" law create additional hurdles for federal enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked an impressive time of 9.87 seconds, edging out Lyles who finished in second place with 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold medal to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second in a dramatic photo finish one year prior.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, who had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups, was pushed off his lines by the intense force of the water, leaving him stranded. A search and rescue team located him using a drone, and a California Highway Patrol helicopter was able to hoist him to safety, where he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to implement a top-down national strategy to accelerate its development of space-based solar power. This advanced technology involves building large solar arrays in orbit to collect energy, which is then transmitted wirelessly to Earth using microwaves or lasers, providing a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The scientist argues that a more focused national effort is needed to close the technological gap with the United States in this emerging and strategic energy sector.</p>
