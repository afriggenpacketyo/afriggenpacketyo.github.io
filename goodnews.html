          <p>As the number of atomic bomb survivors dwindles, attention shifts to the resilient trees that withstood the blast and continue to stand in Hiroshima. These trees offer a tangible connection to the past, providing a more accessible way for people to engage with the painful history of the atomic bombing. They serve as silent witnesses, carrying the legacy of the survivors and offering a unique perspective on the events of that day. These trees provide a powerful reminder of the destruction and resilience in the face of unimaginable tragedy, offering a symbol of hope and perseverance.

          <p>Chinese researchers are leading efforts to address the historical underrepresentation of Southeast Asian populations in genomic research. The Kunming Institute of Zoology, in collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams, has created the SEA3K data set, the first comprehensive genomic atlas of the region. The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical environments and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. This initiative aims to rectify the previous oversight in the Human Genome Project and contribute to a more inclusive understanding of human genetic diversity.</p>

          <p>A Harvard Chinese graduate's speech advocating for unity in a divided world has garnered both praise and criticism in the United States and China. Jiang Yurong, the first Chinese woman to speak at a Harvard graduation ceremony, emphasized the importance of international classrooms and seeing the humanity in those labeled as enemies. While some Chinese social media users were moved by her message, others criticized her elite background. Some US critics have also pointed to alleged links between Jiang and the Chinese Communist Party, leading to a polarized response to her address.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an uncertain global economic outlook, the aviation industry is projected to experience improved profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The IATA report forecasts increases in revenue, operating profits, and net profits for the industry, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year, although fleet expansion faces challenges due to supply chain issues in the aerospace sector. The industry's resilience is attributed to minimal fuel hedging activity, allowing airlines to benefit from reduced fuel costs, and trade tensions are not expected to significantly impact fuel prices.

The merger aims to unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure designed to fend off hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>
