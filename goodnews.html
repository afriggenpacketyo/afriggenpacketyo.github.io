          <p>Dan Tana, a former professional soccer player who founded the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant bearing his name, has passed away at the age of 90. Opened in 1964, the eatery became a cherished institution, famous for its classic red-sauce dishes and its discreet service to a loyal clientele of Hollywood A-listers like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Though Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, its old-world charm and status as a celebrity hotspot have endured, cementing its place in Los Angeles's cultural and culinary history. The article notes his passing with respect for his legacy.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have created a new method for making biological tissues, including brains, transparent to allow for exceptionally clear three-dimensional imaging. The technique produces vivid and highly accurate images by preserving the organ's original structure while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to mark specific cells. According to the research article, this process creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that remains structurally sound and can be stored for long periods at low temperatures. This breakthrough could provide unprecedented views into the inner workings of complex biological systems, advancing neurological and other medical research fields.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' performance was marred by significant errors, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered six shutout innings against his former team, while the offense capitalized on numerous walks issued by Padres starter Dylan Cease. The win not only extended the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the season's head-to-head series against their rivals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Robert J. "Bob" Lowe, a distinguished general, vascular, and transplant surgeon who practiced in Albuquerque for over 50 years, has passed away after a decade-long battle with pancreatic cancer. Dr. Lowe was a pioneer in his field, co-founding a surgical practice known for handling complex cases and helping to introduce laparoscopic donor nephrectomies in New Mexico. Remembered for his intelligence, kindness, and surgical skill, he was also a quiet philanthropist who supported environmental and international aid causes. He is survived by his wife Elena, two children, and three sisters, leaving behind a legacy of medical excellence and compassionate care.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Chargers 31-21 in a preseason game, but the team remains silent on the status of quarterback Matthew Stafford's back injury. Stafford, who has been sidelined with an aggravated disc, was scheduled for a workout, but team officials declined to comment on whether it occurred, deferring to coach Sean McVay's upcoming press conference. With Stafford's availability for the season opener in question, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett's performance is under increasing scrutiny. Bennett played well, throwing for 324 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning pass in the final seconds.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese design proposes a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a single, rotating "scissor wing," a concept once explored by NASA. This innovative aircraft would feature a wing that sits perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient takeoff and subsonic flight, then pivots as it accelerates. At transonic speeds, it would swing to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves, and at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it would align parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire vehicle into a streamlined "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome the traditional aerodynamic compromises between low-speed lift and high-speed performance.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Drivers Behind Infidelity</h2>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those who seem to have perfect lives, risk everything for an affair. The article suggests that infidelity is often not about sex but about deeper emotional needs and unresolved personal issues. These triggers include a lifetime of repressed emotions from always being "good," the self-destructive recoil from perfectionism, a history of poor boundaries learned in childhood, escaping an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, and the life reassessment that often follows a significant personal loss. Understanding these underlying factors is key to addressing the root causes of such decisions.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic-era fortress off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been completely renovated and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, listed building in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year restoration project to make it habitable. The historic fort, once used to defend against French naval attacks, is now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub. Conner describes the arduous process of bringing water and electricity to the island as a "midlife crisis" that ultimately transformed the historic site into a unique, off-grid party venue.</p>

The letters, written just after returning to school from a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. The students' reflections highlight the unique challenges their cohort faced, with their entire secondary education shaped by disruptions like remote learning and social bubbles. Four years later, the students looked back on their younger selves' aspirations, providing a poignant snapshot of resilience and personal growth through a difficult period.</p>
