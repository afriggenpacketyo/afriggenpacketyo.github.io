        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage healthier food choices among consumers. The voluntary plan aims to tackle rising obesity rates by having retailers promote healthier options through discounts, loyalty point incentives, or revised store layouts. While the initiative does not impose specific targets, it requires major food businesses to report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. Critics note that the success of previous voluntary programs has been mixed and that the higher cost of healthy food remains a significant barrier for many families.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is taking a new approach to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

This initiative aims to help athletes adapt to unfamiliar environments and logistical challenges, such as travel and communal living, without it affecting their performance. Officials and athletes reported the experience was valuable for building team morale and fostering a resilient mindset ahead of upcoming international competitions.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, health organizations behind the project hope that instilling these habits early will empower the next generation to protect themselves from harmful UV exposure.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has been a reliable workhorse, supporting Japan's aerospace exploration with a 98% success rate over its long career. The nation's space efforts will now be led by the new, more cost-competitive H3 rocket, which is designed to compete in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a large-scale demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The massive turnout was seen as a direct response to the government's attempts to ban the event, citing a controversial 2021 law that conflates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, addressed the crowd, celebrating the peaceful defiance against a "puffed-up and hateful power." The march highlighted a growing solidarity among citizens in the face of policies widely seen as targeting the LGBTQ community.</p>

The former Microsoft AI head stated that the gap in chip production is substantial and will take years to bridge. However, he highlighted that Chinese companies like DeepSeek are achieving comparable results to top US firms with far less computing power by focusing on breakthroughs in algorithm engineering.
