          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada highlights a significant disparity in funding and professional support within the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with 32 full-time professional players, stands in stark contrast to Canada, whose players earn a fraction of their English counterparts and rely on fundraising to support their campaign. Despite the financial gap, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, leveraging players' experience in England's domestic league and creative preparation strategies. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that heavy investment is the only path to success in women's rugby.</p>

Hooker Amy Cokayne serves as a police officer in the Royal Air Force, while veteran Marlie Packer, a member of the 2014 winning squad, worked as a plumber. Other players transitioned from careers as teachers and painters once full-time contracts became available in recent years. Their stories contrast sharply with the past, when the entire team was amateur, and showcase the dedication required to reach the pinnacle of international rugby.</p>

          <p>A new peace movement is gaining momentum in Germany, with recent large-scale demonstrations in Berlin calling for an end to wars in Gaza and Ukraine. The protests, organized by figures like politician Sahra Wagenknecht, urge the German government to support peace negotiations and halt all arms deliveries to conflict zones. While the movement is currently fragmented, peace and conflict researchers see potential for it to grow, particularly as debate over reinstating compulsory military service mobilizes younger generations. The diverse coalition of activists is planning further large-scale demonstrations, signaling a growing public demand for a more pacifist foreign policy.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pushing for a comprehensive youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping it will provide a positive boost to the public finances ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, which Reeves argues would be beneficial for economic growth and businesses. She is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic benefits into its forecasts, potentially reducing the need for tax increases or spending cuts. The proposal faces criticism from conservatives who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell aims to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading "Wuthering Heights" as a teenager in her upcoming film adaptation. Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, the Oscar-winning filmmaker described her deep, obsessive connection to the classic novel. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film's erotically charged trailer has already generated significant buzz. Fennell explained that her adaptation is an emotional response to the book, which she finds to be singular, sexy, horrible, and devastating, and she has worked to preserve much of Brontë's original dialogue.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms Huawei and AI start-up DeepSeek are spearheading the nation's effort to reduce its reliance on U.S. semiconductor technology, particularly from industry leader Nvidia. DeepSeek recently announced a shift towards supporting domestically produced chips, while Huawei unveiled new hardware from its Ascend chip series designed to deliver world-class computing power. These developments come as Beijing encourages its tech giants to stop purchasing Nvidia chips tailored for the Chinese market. U.S. trade restrictions have inadvertently spurred a wave of domestic innovation, allowing China to make significant gains in its technological rivalry with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough in the treatment of Huntington's disease, reporting that a new gene therapy has slowed the progression of the fatal condition by 75%. The news has been met with emotional relief by the Huntington's community, which has had no effective treatments until now. The therapy, developed by uniQure, is aimed at patients with early-stage symptoms and involves complex brain surgery. While the company plans to apply for a license in the U.S. in 2026, the treatment's path to availability and affordability on national health services remains a key question for affected families.</p>
