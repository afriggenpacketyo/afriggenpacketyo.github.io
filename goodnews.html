          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff stated he is "inspired" by data analytics company Palantir, particularly its high market valuation, while also noting its software is the "most expensive" he has ever seen. Speaking at a technology conference, Benioff highlighted the competitive landscape where Palantir, though smaller in revenue, is growing much faster than Salesforce. This public commentary underscores the ongoing rivalry between the two enterprise software giants, which sometimes compete for major government contracts.</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, alleging that it is operating as an unlicensed sports gambling business. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell's office argues that Kalshi's contracts on sports outcomes constitute sports wagering and must comply with state licensing laws. Kalshi has maintained that its event contracts are federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, giving it precedence over state rules. The state is seeking a court order to halt Kalshi's sports-related offerings.</p>

After months of intense combat, he stated that while fighting continues in border areas, the Russian military group is no longer capable of launching a major attack there. Russia had aimed to establish a buffer zone in the region to prevent Ukrainian incursions. This announcement marks a significant claim of defensive success for Ukraine in a heavily contested area.</p>
