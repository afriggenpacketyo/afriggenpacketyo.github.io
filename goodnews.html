          <p>Eddie Palmieri, a celebrated pianist and bandleader who was a trailblazer in Latin music, has passed away at the age of 88. Known for his highly percussive and innovative piano style, he fused Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz, creating a new sound with his orchestra, La Perfecta. Born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, Palmieri won multiple Grammy Awards and received a Jazz Master Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2013.

She recounted an incident from her school days where she exposed an exam cheater, highlighting her strong stance against rule-breaking. Badenoch also discussed her childhood in Nigeria, her return to the UK at 16, and encountering what she termed a "poverty of low expectations" for Black students from some teachers.

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel returned to the Hollywood Bowl for a performance marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert featured a unique pairing of Duke Ellington's symphonic poems and Maurice Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos, performed by soloist Seong-Jin Cho. While the review praises the orchestra's rare ability to swing and capture the essence of Ellington's work, it notes the Ravel pieces were less successful in the large amphitheater setting. The week is also bittersweet, as Dudamel's Venezuelan orchestra had to cancel their upcoming appearance due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced it will increase its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, a move celebrated by President Trump at the White House. This brings the company's total domestic investment commitment to $600 billion and is expected to create 20,000 U.S. jobs. The pledge is seen as a strategic effort by Apple to avoid the administration's threatened tariffs on foreign-made goods, as the company's supply chain is heavily reliant on international production, particularly in China. The investment will focus on bringing more of Apple's component manufacturing to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from harm. The new regulations will introduce a licensing scheme for clinics, requiring them to meet strict safety and training standards to offer procedures like Botox and fillers. More high-risk treatments, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which has been welcomed by the industry, follows growing concern over rogue practitioners and dangerous complications from unregulated procedures.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC has officially introduced South Korean football star Son Heung-min as its newest player, following a transfer from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported MLS record fee of $26 million.

At 33, Son is still considered a world-class attacker and is expected to have an immediate, significant impact on the league. His immense popularity in South Korea is anticipated to bring global attention and new commercial opportunities to the club.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old domestic students are likely to secure their first-choice university spot this year. This is true even for those who narrowly miss their required grades. Dr. Jo Saxton stated that uncertainty around international student numbers is making UK undergraduates more attractive to universities, as they offer financial stability for planning. This increased flexibility comes as students in England and Wales face higher tuition fees for the upcoming academic year, the first increase since 2017.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Widely Expected to Announce Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:02:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets are anticipating that the Bank of England will cut its key interest rate on Thursday from 4.25% to 4.0%, which would be its lowest level in over two years. A rate cut would provide relief for some homeowners with variable-rate mortgages but would mean lower returns for savers. The expected move comes despite inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target, but signs of a cooling labor market may be giving policymakers room to act. The decision will be accompanied by new forecasts for the UK economy, which has shown stagnant growth in recent months. (not investment advice)</p>
