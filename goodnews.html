        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Zervos, a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair and chief market strategist at Jefferies, is advocating for aggressive interest rate reductions to stimulate the economy. He argues that the central bank should implement a half-percentage-point cut to prevent a labor market slowdown and potentially create a million new jobs. Zervos believes current monetary policy is too restrictive and that recent inflation data should not deter the Fed from easing. His market-focused background is seen as a potential asset for a role traditionally held by economists, and his position aligns with pressure from the Trump administration for significant rate cuts.

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in ten months, with the average 30-year loan rate now at 6.58%, according to Freddie Mac. This decline offers some relief to potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance, though rates remain significantly higher than the sub-3% levels seen in previous years. The article suggests that future rate drops could be influenced by upcoming economic data, including the September unemployment report and inflation figures. The Federal Reserve's next policy meeting is also highlighted as a key event that could further impact the borrowing climate and potentially push mortgage rates down again.

          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from London, has made chess history by becoming the youngest female player to defeat a grandmaster in a competitive game. She achieved the record-breaking victory against 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells during the final round of the British Chess Championships. Sivanandan, who only began playing during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, has already earned the title of "woman international master," the second-highest distinction for female players. Chess experts praise her composure and brilliance, suggesting she has the potential to become a world champion in a sport historically dominated by men.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin is being held in Alaska, a location with deep historical ties to both the United States and Russia. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, Alaska became a strategic front line during the Cold War, home to military installations like the summit's venue, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The state retains Russian cultural influence, with numerous Orthodox Christian communities. The choice of venue is also practical, as its location is relatively accessible for both leaders and, importantly, the U.S. does not recognize the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers led by Professor Daniela Rus are developing artificial intelligence to enable humanoid robots to perform tasks in complex, human-centered environments. To achieve this, students wear sensors that capture motion and force data as they perform activities, teaching robots how to replicate tasks with human-like precision, such as how tightly to grip an object. The goal is to move beyond robots that perform repetitive industrial tasks to create machines capable of assisting with household chores or in medical settings. Rus emphasizes that these AI-powered robots are tools designed to be safe and to extend human capabilities.</p>

          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. This gift represents the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution and will be used to advance cancer research, treatment, and patient care. The donation continues a long-standing philanthropic relationship between the Knights and OHSU, building on a previous challenge where they matched $500 million in fundraising for cancer research. The Knights are among the nation's top philanthropists, with their foundation holding over $5 billion in assets at the end of 2023.</p>

          <p>Kristie Colton, a 28-year-old woman with degenerative blindness, is preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in October, guided by her two closest friends. Diagnosed with Stargardt disease at age 9, Colton has refused to let her condition limit her, having already learned to snowboard and completed the Boston Marathon. She and her friends established a nonprofit, the Vorden Initiative, to educate sighted individuals on how to become allies and athletic guides for the blind. The Kilimanjaro expedition, organized by a former paralympian, will include eleven blind climbers, each with a sighted guide, on the weeklong trek to the nearly 20,000-foot peak.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Palantir's Growth Shows Reliance on Government Contracts and High Valuation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:38:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a more than 1,700% surge since its 2020 public debut, driven significantly by large government contracts. U.S. government revenue, particularly from a multi-billion dollar agreement with the U.S. Army, grew 53% last quarter and accounts for over half of the company's total revenue. This growth has pushed Palantir's market capitalization past $430 billion, giving it a forward price-to-earnings ratio that dwarfs most tech giants, despite having a fraction of their revenue. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, international commercial revenue has declined, raising some concerns among analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK A-Level Results Show Boys Outperforming Girls in Top Grades for First Time in Seven Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:33:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys have surpassed girls in achieving the highest A-level grades in the UK. This year, 28.4% of boys' entries were graded A* or A, compared to 28.2% for girls, reversing a long-standing trend. This shift is likely influenced by the increasing popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are studied by significantly more boys than girls and tend to yield more top grades. While entries for business and economics have also risen, humanities subjects like English and history have declined in popularity. Education officials caution against over-interpreting the small margin, noting the causes are complex.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized as one of Time magazine's "girls of the year" for inventing a device to help homeless people stay warm. At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores heat from the sun in a battery pack for use during cold nights. Her idea won a national engineering competition, and the engineering firm Thales developed it into a working prototype, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also turned into a Lego mini-figure for a digital cover of the magazine.</p>

          <p>Cadets from the West Point class of 2025 have honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting. Wang, who dreamed of attending the military academy, was posthumously accepted into the class for his heroism; he died holding a door open for his classmates to escape the gunman. At their graduation, the class formally recognized Wang as an honorary member, an award given to those who embody the academy's values of duty, honor, and country. Classmates said his story of selfless sacrifice will be an enduring example as they begin their service as commissioned officers in the U.S. Army.</p>
