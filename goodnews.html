          <p>Meta is pursuing legal action against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI to create non-consensual, sexualized images. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent the company from advertising CrushAI on Facebook and Instagram. Meta alleges that Joy Timeline repeatedly attempted to bypass its ad review process after the ads were initially removed for violating policies against adult nudity, sexual activity, and harassment. Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove similar ads, as well as sharing information with other tech companies to address these apps across platforms, demonstrating a commitment to protecting its community from abuse.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for torrential downpours and thunderstorms as the Met Office has issued multiple yellow warnings across southern England, Wales, and southern Scotland. These warnings come as the Environment Agency has declared a drought in Yorkshire following the driest spring in over a century, and Welsh Water has announced a drought developing zone. The thunderstorms are expected to bring heavy rainfall, potentially causing flash flooding, with temperatures predicted to surge, exacerbating the risk of surface water flooding due to the dry conditions. The UK Health Security Agency has also issued heat-health alerts for eastern England, London, the East Midlands, and south-east England, indicating an increased risk to vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation has eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This is the lowest level since February 2019, with food inflation dropping to 0.99%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy in response to these easing inflationary pressures, including a recent 50 basis point cut to the benchmark repo rate. Economists anticipate further rate cuts due to softened commodity prices and increased availability of cheap Chinese goods. India's economy has shown stronger-than-expected growth, and trade negotiations with the U.S. are ongoing to secure a deal before potential tariff increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The backlog in routine hospital treatments in England has decreased to its lowest level in two years, with the waiting list dropping to 7.39 million at the end of April. However, the NHS has not met its target of 92% of patients being seen in 18 weeks for nine years, with the current rate just below 60%. The government has made meeting this target a key mission and announced above-inflation rises for the NHS in the coming years. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said this is "just the start" and extra investment combined with reforms will help build on what has been achieved.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that the collective rituals of the day, such as flares, fireworks, and chanting, are more emotionally intense than the game itself. This highlights that attending football games is about more than just the sport, encompassing a range of emotions and psychological states. Watching football elicits boredom, despair, empathy, and anger, and researchers stress the importance of asking fans about these moments and setting their interpretations in a wider historical and cultural context. Football's collectivities and communitarian cultures offer a sense of belonging in an increasingly individualized world.</p>
