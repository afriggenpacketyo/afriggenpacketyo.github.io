          <p>Following the U.S. and China's agreement to suspend most tariffs for 90 days, President Trump stated he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who purportedly intends to increase Apple's investments in the United States. Trump suggested Cook would be building more plants in the U.S., potentially reaching $500 billion in investments. Apple had previously announced plans to invest $500 billion to expand U.S. operations, including assembling AI servers in Houston. The easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China is expected to benefit Apple, which relies on China for much of its production and sales.</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu credited Alexander's release to military and political pressure exerted by President Trump, while Trump expressed joy at Alexander's return home.

          <p>As gold prices hover near record highs, investors are considering whether to sell their gold investments. While selling could yield substantial profits, especially for those who bought before 2025, it also means losing a reliable portfolio diversifier that typically holds value during market instability. Selling is relatively easy due to numerous gold buyers, but investors would need to find another hedge against inflation. The article advises investors to carefully weigh these factors, considering selling a portion of their gold to secure profits while retaining some for portfolio diversification.

However, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remained high at $1.05 trillion, 13% higher than the previous year.

          <p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva is seeking to build "indestructible" relations with China, as leaders from Colombia and Chile also visit Beijing. Lula criticized Trump's tariffs and praised China's engagement with countries often overlooked by others.
