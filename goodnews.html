          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is gaining strength over the central Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will remain over open waters, passing east of Bermuda on Monday without any direct watches or warnings for land areas. However, Gabrielle is expected to generate significant ocean swells that will affect the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada early next week. The storm's formation comes after the historical peak of the hurricane season, which has been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. By analyzing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides, which they attribute to seismic activity known as moonquakes. This finding, published in the National Science Review, has significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases on the moon. The study underscores the need to assess geological hazards, as endogenic activity on the moon has not ceased as previously thought.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout hit his 400th career home run, a significant milestone for one of baseball's most dominant players of the last decade. The achievement is celebrated in an article that also reflects on what could have been, as numerous injuries have significantly limited his playing time in recent seasons. Despite winning three MVP awards and consistently performing at an elite level, Trout has only played in three postseason games, all in 2014. The piece appreciates his loyalty to the Angels and his quiet professionalism, positioning him as a modern great whose full potential has been hampered by physical setbacks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point has paradoxically resulted in an increase in long-term rates, including those for mortgages. While the stock market reacted positively, bond traders sold off long-term bonds, driving their yields higher. Analysts suggest this reaction reflects concerns that the Fed may be easing its monetary policy too soon, potentially ignoring inflation risks while the economy remains relatively stable. This market behavior indicates skepticism about the central bank's strategy and its potential impact on future inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Sales of Used Electric Vehicles Surge Amidst Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite general consumer caution and economic headwinds, sales of used electric vehicles in the U.S. have surged, with a 40% spike recorded for the month of July. A key driver of this trend is the discovery by buyers that pre-owned EVs are often priced lower than comparable gasoline-powered cars, even before factoring in savings on fuel and maintenance. This boom in the used market is occurring as the overall EV market share grows, reaching nearly 10% of all cars sold in August. The trend suggests that affordability is a major factor in accelerating the consumer transition to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly set to become the first female CEO of Deutsche Bahn, Germany's state-owned national railway operator. The 52-year-old executive, who currently runs the company's regional subsidiary DB Regio, is expected to be officially appointed by the transport minister on Monday. Her appointment comes as part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at modernizing the beleaguered company. Deutsche Bahn has been plagued by persistent delays, cancellations, and aging infrastructure, prompting Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government to promise significant management changes and infrastructure investment to improve service.</p>

          <p>A significant weakening of the Japanese yen is driving a boom in tourism from China, with visitor numbers up substantially compared to the previous year. Chinese travelers, particularly from the middle and upper classes, are taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate to spend on high-end goods, cultural experiences, and unique Japanese merchandise. In the first eight months of 2025, Japan recorded over 6.7 million visits from Chinese tourists, a notable increase from the 4.6 million during the same period last year. This trend is providing a welcome boost to Japan's tourism and retail sectors.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Anuparna Roy has made history as the first Indian director to win the Orizzonti Award at the Venice Film Festival for her debut feature, "Songs of Forgotten Trees." The film tells the story of two women from different backgrounds in Mumbai who form an intimate bond while navigating survival, desire, and urban marginalization. Roy's victory is particularly notable given her grassroots origins in a tribal village in West Bengal and her path into filmmaking after working at a call center to self-fund her first short. Her film has been praised by critics for its subtle and authentic portrayal of its characters.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics will eliminate all jobs by around 2030, leading to a future of "sustainable abundance." He suggests that instead of a universal basic income, society will implement a "universal high income," where everyone's needs, including top-tier healthcare, housing, and food, are met. This optimistic vision contrasts with widespread anxiety about job displacement due to automation. However, critics question the feasibility of such a system, citing current government debt and the immense political and economic challenges of funding it.</p>

          <p>A new stage adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" transposes the story to the 21st century, swapping Regency-era society balls for modern Essex nightclubs and matchmaking for meddling in friends' dating app profiles.

The adaptation explores contemporary themes of social status, friendship, and romance through the lens of technology and working-class life. It aims to capture the timeless human conditions of jealousy and love that made the original 1815 novel a masterpiece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing athletic performance and muscle growth, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating brain fog. The naturally occurring compound helps cells produce energy, which is crucial for high-intensity physical activity and brain function. While research has extensively documented its effects on muscles, a growing but still limited body of evidence suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. Experts note that more studies are needed, particularly regarding its effects on women and conditions like perimenopausal brain fog, before definitive conclusions can be drawn.</p>
