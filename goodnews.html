          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Cognition has secured $400 million in a new funding round, elevating its valuation to $10.2 billion just two months after its strategic acquisition of Windsurf. The company, known for developing the AI software engineer "Devin," has seen its annual recurring revenue more than double since the purchase. This new valuation places Cognition among elite AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, signaling strong investor confidence in its growth trajectory. The funding was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and will be used to further develop both the Devin and Windsurf platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue. Under the terms, Lachlan's siblings—Prue MacLeod, Elizabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding company shares and are expected to sell their holdings. This resolution ends all litigation over the family trust and formalizes the leadership transition for the influential media conglomerate.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent participation in a military parade in Beijing alongside other world leaders represents a major diplomatic victory, transforming his image from an isolated pariah to a recognized global figure. The event marked a stark contrast to a decade ago when North Korea was diplomatically sidelined while South Korea enjoyed close ties with China. This shift is the culmination of years of strategic efforts by Kim to elevate his country's international standing, which began with brokered talks with the U.S. in 2018. The appearance signifies a successful move to break free from long-standing diplomatic constraints and sanctions.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote paddling across the Raccoon Strait, the deep waterway separating the island from mainland Marin County in the San Francisco Bay. This sighting provides a rare glimpse into how the island's "budding population" of coyotes, first established in 2017, likely arrived. Researchers believe the original breeding pair swam over a mile through strong currents to colonize the island, filling a new predator niche. The park confirmed that coyotes are strong swimmers and is using the incident to educate the public on coexisting with the growing local wildlife population.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners, who purchased the property in 2023 with plans to raze it and expand their adjacent estate, had challenged the landmark status in court. The ruling is a victory for historians and fans who argued that the house, the only one Monroe ever owned and where she died in 1962, is an irreplaceable piece of Hollywood history. The decision concludes a lengthy public battle over cultural preservation in the city.</p>

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport partially evacuated its Terminal 4 on Monday due to a scare involving possible hazardous materials, but has since reopened after emergency services found no trace of any harmful substance. The London Fire Brigade and Metropolitan Police conducted a thorough search of the area following reports that prompted the precautionary evacuation of the check-in area. Twenty-one people were assessed by paramedics at the scene, with one person taken to the hospital as a precaution, though no one was in a life-threatening condition. The airport apologized for the disruption and is working to get flight schedules back to normal.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest High-Yield Savings Accounts Remain a Valuable Option Despite Impending Fed Rate Cuts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the expectation of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, financial experts suggest that high-yield savings accounts remain a worthwhile option for many savers. Even with slightly lower rates, these accounts offer returns that are exponentially higher than those of traditional savings accounts, which currently average just 0.39%. Because rate cuts are expected to be gradual, the immediate impact on returns will be minimal, making it sensible to open an account now to capitalize on current rates. Furthermore, these accounts provide crucial liquidity and access to funds, a key advantage in an uncertain economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the latest updated COVID-19 vaccines, specifically targeting adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with certain medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness.

The list of high-risk conditions is extensive, including common ailments like asthma, diabetes, and obesity, making an estimated 100 to 200 million Americans eligible under the new framework.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better terms. Improving one's credit score is paramount, as higher FICO scores directly translate to lower interest rates offered by lenders. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, also reduces risk for lenders and can result in a more favorable rate. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a significantly lower initial rate.

          <p>The article explores whether seniors can avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which is $185 in 2025. While completely avoiding the premium is not possible for most, there are specific scenarios for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance. Seniors still working with creditable employer health coverage can delay Part B without penalty, and low-income individuals may qualify for Medicare Savings Programs that help cover the cost. However, forgoing Part B enrollment can make one ineligible for crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs later.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance for savers considering where to deposit a significant sum like $40,000, comparing the merits of a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. A key consideration is the long-term interest potential; a CD locks in a fixed rate, protecting against future rate cuts, while a high-yield savings account rate is variable. Savers must also assess their need for liquidity, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, whereas savings accounts offer flexibility. Despite declining rates, both options remain far more profitable than traditional savings accounts, which offer minimal returns. (not investment advice)</p>
