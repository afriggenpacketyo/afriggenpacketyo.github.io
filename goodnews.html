Commissioned in 2019, the 70,000-tonne vessel is a key instrument in China's strategy for long-range power projection beyond the first island chain in the Western Pacific. As the nation's second carrier, following the retrofitted Liaoning, the Shandong represents a significant milestone in President Xi Jinping's military modernization plans. Its presence underscores the PLA Navy's ambition to develop a blue-water fleet capable of operating globally.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is making a notable return to international rugby after being called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia. He will replace Elliot Daly, who was ruled out with a fractured arm.

The news was supported by Saudi boxing figure Turki Alalshikh, who confirmed discussions for Fury's return.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Republican members of the House Freedom Caucus must pass President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" to prevent a massive, economy-killing tax hike scheduled for 2026. The author contends that voting against the bill over deficit concerns would be a self-defeating move, effectively handing a political victory to Democrats and causing market turmoil. Instead of blocking the current legislation, the piece suggests that fiscally conservative members should be given the opportunity to lead a second, future reconciliation bill focused on deeper spending cuts and entitlement reform.

          <p>Recent research highlights a phenomenon where some healthy individuals experience a sharp drop in blood sugar two to three hours after eating carbohydrates, leading to fatigue, hunger, and mood changes. These individuals, termed "dippers," may consume hundreds of extra calories per day as a result. To stabilize blood sugar, experts recommend pairing carbohydrates with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, a practice they call "putting clothes on your carbs." Additionally, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day and eating proteins and fats before carbs in a meal can help prevent these significant fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt, a lack of cooling vegetation, and heat trapped by tall buildings and pollution. The temperature difference can be as much as 15 degrees Celsius. Potential solutions include greening cities with more trees and parks, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements that enhance water evaporation to cool surfaces.</p>

The findings confirm that the ancestral homeland was likely near the Ural Mountains and show how modern speakers in places like Finland, Estonia, and Hungary can trace this Siberian ancestry in their DNA, solving a puzzle separate from the Indo-European language tree.</p>

          <p>The BRICS bloc, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has expanded to include ten nations and now represents a significant challenge to the Western-led global order. Representing over 40% of the world's population and more than a third of global GDP, the group aims to increase its influence in world affairs. It has created alternatives to the World Bank and IMF and is exploring ways to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. While internal divisions and competing interests exist, dozens more nations have expressed interest in joining, signaling its growing geopolitical importance.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal's 4-3 victory over Manchester City in the Club World Cup represents a landmark moment for the Saudi Pro League and Asian football. The win challenges the perception of the league as merely a destination for aging, high-paid stars. Al-Hilal, a historically successful club now backed by the nation's Public Investment Fund, demonstrated its strength with a team blending international stars and Saudi talent. The result serves as a powerful statement about the growing competitiveness of Saudi football on the global stage and the closing gap with Europe's elite clubs.</p>
