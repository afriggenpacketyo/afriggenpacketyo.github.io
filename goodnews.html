          <p>Amid geopolitical tensions and de-dollarization discussions, Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan. Businesses in Qatar are keen to leverage Hong Kong's yuan capabilities for trade and investment with China, indicating a shift away from the US dollar. This trend aligns with China's strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. The increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments benefits Hong Kong's financial sector, creating more deals and opportunities amidst strengthening ties between China and oil-rich nations.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established throughout England over the next decade to alleviate congestion in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to treat acute mental distress. The NHS aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, avoiding prolonged A&E waits. However, concerns have been raised about funding and the separation of physical and mental health issues, with calls for robust testing of the model before national rollout and better funding for NHS mental health services.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident raised concerns about air traffic control and safety near the airport, especially after a previous deadly midair collision. The Army attributed the lost contact to a temporary antenna issue and stated that the helicopter's location was continuously broadcast. However, federal air traffic controllers reportedly had conflicting data on the helicopter's location, leading to confusion. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before sharing it with them.</p>

The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal will facilitate the transport of resources from Jiangxi, a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles, to seaports in Zhejiang. The canal is designed to accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle approximately 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, enhancing China's inland waterway network.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on respect, not threats, following President Trump's suggestion of imposing a 50% tariff on EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stressed the importance of mutual respect in EU-US trade relations. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward. The EU remains committed to securing a deal that benefits both parties and is prepared to defend its interests.</p>

          <p>Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap performed at their biggest festival headline gig just days after a band member was charged with a terror offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah. The band denied the offence, calling it "political policing." At the Wide Awake festival, the rapper urged fans to be "on the right side of history" and expressed solidarity with Palestine. Fans wearing Irish and Palestinian flags supported the band, while critics have called them dangerous upstarts. Other Kneecap gigs have been cancelled, and some politicians have called for them to be banned.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to lower prices to 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative seeks to address mounting criticism over rising rice prices, which have hurt households amid ongoing inflation. The government is expected to begin procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The move follows a record high in supermarket rice prices, driven by a poor harvest and increased demand. However, analysts remain uncertain whether the limited reserve supply will significantly impact overall rice prices.</p>

          <h2>Weather Balloon Site Cuts Impact Forecasting Accuracy, Meteorologists Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cuts to weather balloon sites by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are leaving the U.S. without crucial weather data, according to some meteorologists. At least 13 sites have been affected, including locations in Michigan, Wisconsin, and the Rocky Mountains. These cuts have created gaps in data, potentially impacting the accuracy of forecasts for events like ice storms and severe thunderstorms. Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture, which cannot be fully replicated by satellites or radar. NOAA defends its forecasting capabilities, but former NWS leaders warn of potential loss of life due to staffing and program cuts.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his upcoming concert tour dates due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advised Joel to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. Joel had been scheduled to perform in several cities across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with special guests like Stevie Nicks and Rod Stewart. NPH is a condition where fluid builds up in the brain, causing pressure on brain tissue, and can be treated with a surgical procedure.</p>
