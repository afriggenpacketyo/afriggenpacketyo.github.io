          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), which has been in power since 1959, is projected to win another general election, bolstering Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's mandate as he navigates economic uncertainties. The PAP is expected to secure 87 seats in Parliament, while the opposition Workers Party is slated to retain 10 seats. Voters expressed concerns about living costs and housing availability, with the opposition calling for more scrutiny of the PAP's spending. The PAP maintains it has invested billions to help citizens manage rising costs through various financial aid programs.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term, a turnaround for the Labor Party that initially trailed in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The election saw a resounding defeat for the conservative opposition, with Albanese widening Labor's parliamentary majority. Voters expressed anxieties about making ends meet, leading both parties to offer incremental relief proposals. The election largely avoided addressing Australia's complex relationship with the U.S. for defense and China for trade, and Albanese emphasized facing global challenges with uniquely Australian solutions.</p>
