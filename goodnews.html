          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing Florida from further expanding its "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center located in the Everglades. The ruling formalizes a temporary halt on construction, with the judge citing a failure by state officials to justify the facility's location or consider alternatives. Environmental advocates argued that the expansion violated environmental laws and threatened the sensitive ecosystem. In her decision, the judge ordered that fencing, lighting, and generators should be removed within 60 days as the number of detainees is expected to decrease through transfers.</p>

          <p>A tentative settlement has been reached between Elon Musk's social media company, X, and thousands of former employees who were laid off after his 2022 takeover. The class-action lawsuit sought $500 million in severance pay, alleging the company failed to honor its original commitment of up to six months' salary. Instead, many of the approximately 6,000 terminated workers received only one month of severance or nothing at all. While the specific terms of the agreement have not been disclosed, both parties have requested a postponement of a court hearing to finalize the details.</p>

          <p>Julian Her, a 13-year-old from Northern California, may have set a new junior world record after catching a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass in Tomales Bay. The eighth-grader, who weighs only slightly more than his catch, was on a family fishing trip when he reeled in the giant fish. The family is now working with the International Game Fish Association to certify the catch, which would surpass the previous junior record of 59 pounds set in 2002. The impressive haul has made the young angler a local celebrity, highlighting a memorable end to his summer vacation.</p>

The address comes amid significant political pressure on the institution from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly called for lower rates. Powell is expected to navigate these pressures while providing guidance on the Fed's response to recent inflation and labor market data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has ordered the complete closure of the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility within 60 days, citing irreparable harm to the Florida Everglades. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams's ruling formalizes a previous halt on construction and prohibits any new detainees from being brought to the site. The decision is a significant victory for environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, who argued the hastily built camp violated environmental laws and threatened a fragile ecosystem. State officials criticized the ruling and have indicated their intent to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Authorities have removed a massive illegal marijuana cultivation site from a remote area of Sequoia National Park, clearing nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash. The operation caused significant environmental damage, including diverting a creek, clearing natural vegetation, and contaminating the soil with hazardous pesticides like methamidophos, which is banned in the U.S. Law enforcement officials noted that such farms, often run by organized drug-trafficking groups, pose a severe threat to the park's ecosystem and wildlife. This bust is part of a two-decade-long effort to eradicate these illegal grows from national parks.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, instructing them to reduce sugar and salt levels and cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new standards, after which the government may consider alternative measures if sufficient changes are not made.</p>
