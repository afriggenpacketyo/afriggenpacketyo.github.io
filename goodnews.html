          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with bipartisan U.S. congressional leaders to discuss security, the ongoing war in Gaza, and regional stability. During these discussions, Netanyahu reportedly advocated for regime change in Iran, suggesting it would benefit both the Iranian people and the wider Middle East. The visit underscores the close coordination between the Israeli government and the Trump administration on key foreign policy issues, including the stated goal of dismantling Hamas's capabilities and ensuring the release of all hostages.</p>

          <p>Joe Locke, known for his role in the Netflix series "Heartstopper," is set to make his West End debut in the play "Clarkston." The production, written by Samuel D. Hunter of "The Whale" fame, centers on two young men who form a bond while working night shifts at a Costco in a small Washington town. Locke expressed his excitement for the role, noting his interest in playing complex, flawed characters. The play explores themes of class, friendship, and platonic male love, and Locke's casting marks a significant step in his transition from screen to stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own hardware solution, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to cool the next generation of power-hungry Nvidia GPUs used for AI. The company determined that existing commercial liquid-cooling options were either too slow to implement or inefficient at the scale AWS operates. This custom hardware allows AWS to integrate Nvidia's most powerful new chips, like the GB200 NVL72, into its data centers more effectively. The move is consistent with Amazon's strategy of developing in-house technology, from chips to routers, to reduce reliance on third parties and improve margins.</p>

The rally is occurring even as corporate purchases of Bitcoin have outpaced inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts suggest that continued institutional adoption and potential crypto-friendly legislation could drive prices even higher in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida law that would make it a state crime for some undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. The decision keeps the law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, on hold while legal challenges proceed. A federal judge had previously ruled that the law likely oversteps state authority by encroaching on the federal government's exclusive power to regulate immigration. The ACLU, which challenged the law, praised the Supreme Court's denial, reaffirming the principle that states cannot create and enforce their own immigration systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal at the White House to advance his "trade, not aid" policy toward Africa. During the summit, the African leaders praised Trump and made direct appeals for U.S. investment in their nations' resources, including rare earth minerals. Analysts suggest the meeting reflects a strategic U.S. shift to compete with China and Russia for influence and access to Africa's prized resources. The discussions also likely covered key U.S. interests such as migration control and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea.</p>
