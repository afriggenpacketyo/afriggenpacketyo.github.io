          <p>China is introducing 19 measures to stimulate service consumption by easing market access and increasing supply in sectors like culture, sports, and healthcare. These measures include opening up the culture industry, introducing more international sports events, and attracting foreign investment in medical care. To boost demand, authorities plan to expand visa-free access for foreign visitors and explore adjustments to school holiday schedules. Authorities will also encourage financial institutions to increase lending to businesses in these sectors. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its key interest rate, leading economists and investors to seek signals about future rate adjustments. The central bank typically chooses between a measured pace reflecting modest adjustments or rapid cuts to stave off recession. Most economists anticipate a measured approach with up to five rate cuts by mid-next year to keep the economy growing. Persistent inflation, partly due to tariffs, could hinder rapid rate cuts.

          <p>Zimbabwe has reached a $455 million agreement with Jindal Steel's Africa unit for the refurbishment of the Hwange coal-fired power plant. The 15-year concession deal aims to improve the plant's capacity, which currently meets only half of the country's electricity demand. The project is expected to take four years, with Jindal Africa recovering its investment through electricity sales. The Hwange plant, upgraded in 2023, still suffers from breakdowns in its older units, affecting its overall capacity. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. presents an opportunity to deepen trade and business ties between the two countries, with the U.K. economy currently stagnating. The U.K. frequently uses state visits to foster stronger trade relationships, as seen with previous visits from leaders like China's Xi Jinping. Several companies, including Nvidia, OpenAI, Blackstone, Apple, and BlackRock, are expected to announce significant investments in the U.K. during the visit. The U.K. aims to establish "AI sovereignty" and secure American AI packages as a counterweight to China's offerings. </p>

          <p>Yiwu, a major wholesale market in China, is shifting its customer base away from the U.S. due to the U.S.-China trade war and tariffs. Exports to the U.S. from Yiwu have declined, while exports to the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia have increased. This shift reflects a broader trend in China, where suppliers are turning to new, non-U.S. markets for stability. Despite ongoing trade talks, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods remain high, making it less attractive for Yiwu merchants to sell to the U.S. </p>

          <p>The offshore yuan has strengthened past 7.1 against the US dollar, reaching its strongest level in nearly a year, ahead of an anticipated interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve. This milestone reflects a gradual shift in China's monetary policy, with the yuan gaining ground over the last month. The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce a lowering of interest rates during its two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Analysts predict that the Fed's easing will further depreciate the US dollar, leading to greater stability and strength for the yuan. (not investment advice) </p>

The visit comes almost exactly a year after Starmer and Trump first met, and while the relationship is considered a triumph, its unpredictability is acknowledged.
