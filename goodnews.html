          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade agreement with Indonesia, which he described as a "great deal, for everybody." The announcement, made on Truth Social, came a week after Trump had threatened a 32% tariff on Indonesian exports to the U.S. and follows what he termed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. While Trump provided no specific details, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Indonesia would drop its tariffs on U.S. goods as part of the agreement, which involves a trade partnership valued at over $38 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency industry's super PAC, Fairshake, has announced it holds over $141 million in cash on hand, highlighting the sector's escalating political influence. This financial strength, bolstered by a recent $25 million donation from Coinbase, comes as the U.S. House prepares to debate key crypto-related legislation. The bills under consideration would establish regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including dividing oversight and setting new rules for stablecoins. Fairshake's substantial funding and successful backing of candidates in 2024 signal a concerted effort to shape future policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with net income rising 25% to $4.02 billion. The bank's revenue reached $21.67 billion, beating estimates, largely due to a 16% increase in markets revenue and an 18% jump in banking revenue compared to the previous year. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance and noted that market volatility has been beneficial for the firm's trading profits. Despite the positive results, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a "deterioration" in the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ocean exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Japanese destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedo boats during a key World War II battle off the Solomon Islands. The warship was found more than 2,600 feet below the surface in Iron Bottom Sound, a site of numerous naval battles in 1942. A remotely operated vehicle captured the first images of the vessel in over 80 years, revealing it was severed in two and still armed with intact depth charges. The discovery provides new historical insights, as no photographs of the Teruzuki were known to exist.</p>

The CLARITY Act, which defines oversight roles for the SEC and CFTC, faces a more challenging path in the Senate due to some Democrats' concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto ventures. A narrower stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is also up for a vote and has a stronger chance of becoming law. The crypto industry is heavily lobbying for the passage of both measures to provide regulatory certainty. (not investment advice)</p>
