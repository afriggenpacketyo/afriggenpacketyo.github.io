          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, currently North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa, a 25-year veteran of the company, will assume his new role effective June 23, with an extraordinary shareholder meeting planned for his election to the board. This leadership change comes after Stellantis reported a 14% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties. John Elkann will continue as executive chairman, expressing confidence in Filosa's ability to lead Stellantis through a crucial phase of development. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to supply lower-priced, stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas to combat surging retail rice prices. This decision follows the suspension of orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller shops. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the government will ensure reserve rice reaches people in rural areas, potentially imposing purchase limits on large retailers. Retail rice prices have doubled from the previous year, prompting the government to switch to direct sales to retailers after previous auction releases failed to curb the price surge. </p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalized. The London Drugs Commission, chaired by Lord Falconer, made 42 recommendations, including removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Sadiq Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the report provides "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalization. David Raynes, of the National Prevention of Drugs Alliance, expressed concern that decriminalization would send the wrong message about the harmfulness of cannabis. </p>

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) counted 43,626 puffins on Skomer Island this year, a record high. The increased number of puffins on the nature reserve is a "conservation success story", but the WTSWW warned that the birds are still a species under threat which should continue to be protected. The island's isolation means that it is protected from predators and human impact. </p>
