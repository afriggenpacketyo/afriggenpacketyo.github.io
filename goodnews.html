          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney stated that they are taking time to consider their options, the safety of their children, and how to address the harms they have suffered. A federal judge had previously expressed suspicion that the Trump administration deported the child without due process. The Justice Department argued it was in the child's best interest to remain in her mother's custody, denying any risk of irreparable harm.</p>

Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation, requiring adherence to a limited budget framework. The narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for fiscal responsibility could complicate the process and impact individual provisions.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee rattled homes across the southern US. The earthquake struck about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, and tremors were felt as far away as Atlanta. While no injuries or major damage were immediately reported, the event serves as a reminder of seismic activity in the region. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast.</p>

The spacecraft became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a booster malfunction. Its return serves as a reminder of the Cold War-era space race and the Soviet Union's ambitions for exploring Venus. The Venera program, while successful in sending probes to Venus, highlights the risks and challenges of space exploration.</p>
