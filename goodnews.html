          <p>In partnership with the NFL's "Crucial Catch" initiative, the Baltimore Ravens hosted a special event for over 30 women impacted by cancer at their M&T Bank Stadium. Participants enjoyed activities like making flower bouquets, receiving massages, and getting fitted for customized wigs provided by a player's foundation. Ravens players Tavius Robinson and Jaire Alexander attended, taking time to support the community despite a recent loss. The event was praised by attendees for making them feel special and demonstrating the organization's commitment to community well-being beyond football.</p>

          <p>Neptune Insurance Holdings, the largest private flood insurer in the U.S., successfully launched its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, with its stock opening higher than the IPO price. The company's debut is particularly timely as the ongoing federal government shutdown has halted operations for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), preventing it from processing new claims or applications. Neptune's CEO highlighted that the company remains open for business, offering a private-sector alternative that uses advanced technology to assess risk and can provide coverage for homeowners needing insurance to close on their properties.

          <p>Intel's stock price increased significantly following a report that the company is in preliminary discussions to manufacture chips for its primary competitor, AMD, through its foundry business. Securing a major customer like AMD would be a substantial victory for Intel Foundry, validating its manufacturing capabilities and potentially attracting other high-profile clients. The move would also signify AMD's confidence in using its main rival for production, a notable shift in the competitive landscape of the semiconductor industry. Both Intel and AMD have declined to comment on the speculation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As households face mounting financial stress from high borrowing costs and inflation, many are considering bankruptcy, but financial experts advise exploring alternatives first due to its long-term negative consequences. Options such as debt consolidation through a single loan can simplify payments and potentially lower interest rates for those with good credit. Other viable strategies include working with a credit counseling agency to create a debt management plan, negotiating lump-sum settlements with creditors, or enrolling in temporary creditor hardship programs. These approaches can provide significant debt relief without the severe, lasting impact that a bankruptcy filing has on one's credit and financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton has voiced his support for the controversial "tush push" play, famously utilized by the Philadelphia Eagles, calling it one of the safest plays in football. As his team prepares to face the Eagles, Payton dismissed concerns about player safety, suggesting that such arguments are disingenuous if the real opposition is based on aesthetic or competitive reasons. The play, a variation of a quarterback sneak with assistance from pushing players, has been a topic of debate in the NFL, with some teams proposing a ban. The Eagles have continued to use it effectively, even developing variations like a fake handoff for a touchdown.</p>

          <h2>Veteran Actors Continue to Command Star Power in Film and Television</h2>

          <p>On the UN International Day of Older Persons, the enduring appeal of veteran actors is evident in recent successful films and television series. Productions like "The Thursday Murder Club," starring Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, and the hit show "Only Murders in the Building," led by Steve Martin and Martin Short, demonstrate that older performers remain major draws for audiences. These actors bring decades of craft and charisma to their roles, challenging ageist stereotypes in Hollywood and proving that talent and screen presence are timeless. Figures like Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood have also continued to deliver acclaimed performances late in their careers, embracing their age and experience.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order allowing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to temporarily remain in her position, denying President Trump's request for her immediate removal. The President had attempted to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Cook sued to block her dismissal, arguing it was an illegal act of political interference in the central bank's independence, motivated by her monetary policy views. The court will hear full arguments on the matter in January, allowing Cook to continue participating in the Fed's interest rate decisions for now. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. home equity at a record high and interest rates declining, homeowners are increasingly considering tapping into their property's value, facing a choice between a home equity loan and a HELOC. A HELOC currently offers slightly lower, variable interest rates that could fall further with anticipated Fed cuts, making it a potentially cheaper option in the short term. However, a home equity loan provides the security of a fixed rate, protecting borrowers from future market volatility and making budgeting more predictable. The decision ultimately depends on an individual's risk tolerance and financial strategy, balancing the appeal of lower initial costs against long-term stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record-breaking demand for electric vehicles. The surge in EV sales was partly fueled by consumers rushing to purchase vehicles before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's saw a 30% increase. Automakers are now introducing new pricing and incentive strategies to maintain momentum in the EV market after the federal credit program ended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand, named "Amazon Grocery," aimed at attracting budget-conscious shoppers. The brand consolidates the company's existing Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh labels and features over 1,000 items, with the majority priced under $5. This move is part of Amazon's ongoing efforts to strengthen its position in the competitive grocery market, which has seen mixed results for the company recently. The announcement of a new value-focused brand caused a slight dip in the stock prices of competing grocery chains like Kroger and Walmart, signaling its potential to disrupt the sector.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Afghanistan have expressed joy and relief after the Taliban government restored internet and telecommunication services following a 48-hour nationwide blackout. The shutdown had severely disrupted daily life, halting businesses, flights, and access to emergency services, drawing condemnation from the United Nations. For many, especially women and girls whose rights have been drastically curtailed, the internet serves as a vital link to the outside world and education. While the Taliban has not given an official reason for the blackout, the restoration was met with spontaneous celebrations in the streets of Kabul as people reconnected with family and the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, significantly reducing the cost of homeownership. For a $450,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment at the current average rate of 6.13% is approximately $2,736. This represents a savings of about $270 per month compared to rates in January and nearly $500 per month compared to the peak rates of late 2024. The lower borrowing costs are creating new opportunities for potential homebuyers who were previously priced out of the market. (not investment advice)</p>
