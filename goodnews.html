          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, achieved a significant milestone by reaching space during its ninth test flight, surpassing previous attempts that ended in explosions. However, a propellant leak caused the spacecraft to spin out of control during re-entry, leading to its disintegration over the Indian Ocean. Despite the loss of the vehicle, SpaceX considers the flight a valuable learning experience, noting improvements in ascent and heat shield performance. Elon Musk indicated that the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, although past schedules have often been unrealistic, while also describing the goals of the Artemis program as objectively feeble.</p>

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, previously North American chief operating officer and Jeep CEO, as its new chief executive officer. Filosa, a 25-year veteran of the company, will assume his role effective June 23, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who resigned unexpectedly in December. This change comes amidst financial challenges for Stellantis, including a 14% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net revenues and the withdrawal of full-year financial guidance due to trade uncertainties. The company's executive chairman, John Elkann, expressed confidence in Filosa's understanding of the company and the industry to lead Stellantis in its next phase of development.</p>

This alliance involves significant investments, including the $500 billion Stargate Project, and aims to diversify the UAE's economy beyond oil and enhance its geopolitical influence. The U.S. plans to ease tech export restrictions, potentially allowing sensitive American technology to reach the UAE, although this move raises concerns about technology ending up in the hands of rivals.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is committed to delivering lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas to combat surging rice prices. This action follows the suspension of orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller businesses. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the government will ensure reserve rice reaches rural populations, potentially imposing purchase limits on larger retailers. Retail rice prices have doubled from the previous year, prompting the government to switch to direct sales to retailers after previous auction releases failed to control the price increase.</p>

          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines, potentially boosting the performance of both military and civilian aircraft. The new alloy turbine blade is designed to withstand significantly higher temperatures, leading to increased engine thrust, improved fuel efficiency, and extended service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) developed the method, reinforcing its leadership in high-performance propulsion technologies. This innovation addresses the limitation of conventional turbine blades that degrade under extreme heat, influencing engine performance.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth flight test, although the vehicle successfully reached orbit before an apparent propellant leak caused a loss of control. The upper stage of Starship likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, but the company noted the test as a valuable learning opportunity for future missions. Mounted atop a Super Heavy rocket, the uncrewed Starship lifted off from South Texas, but the heavy booster appears to have exploded while splashing down in the Gulf. The company intends to make Starship fully reusable and capable of frequent launches with minimal maintenance.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalised. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalisation. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education, while critics argue that any reduction in legal consequences would wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful.</p>

          <p>A new COVID variant, known as NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. after a surge in China, although it is not yet tracked on federal variant dashboards. The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring, and while it is present in 22 countries, the U.S. has reported too few sequences for inclusion in the CDC's dashboard. Though the public health risk is evaluated as low at the global level, there is some evidence that the variant may infect people more easily than previous strains. The FDA said it would shift to narrow approval for updated COVID vaccines, but currently-approved shots are expected to remain effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant.</p>

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales counted 43,626 puffins on Skomer Island this year, a record high, attributing the growth to an abundance of food and a lack of predators. While puffins are thriving on Skomer, the species is listed as vulnerable to extinction globally due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change. Skomer Island's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, contributing to the puffins' success.</p>
