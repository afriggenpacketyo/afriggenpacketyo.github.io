          <h2>Maersk Cuts Global Container Market Outlook Amidst Trade Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 02:51:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, despite posting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits. The company, a key indicator of global trade, maintained its full-year profit guidance between $6 billion and $9 billion. CEO Vincent Clerc noted that trade tensions and rising uncertainty are putting global supply chains in the spotlight, with ongoing disruptions in the Red Sea expected to continue throughout the year. The shipping industry is currently navigating a complex tariff landscape influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, including high import duties on products from China, which have led to retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast for the successor to the successful Switch device. The Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., boasts improved features compared to its predecessor and is set to launch in June. The original Switch, launched in 2017, became Nintendo's second-best-selling console, and investors are optimistic about the company's continued popularity, with shares up 33% this year. However, pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. were delayed due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo's consoles are manufactured.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to Buddha's remains in Hong Kong after the Indian government threatened legal action. The collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, was deemed an "inalienable religious and cultural heritage" by India, which argued its sale would violate Indian and international laws. The auction house agreed to the postponement to allow for discussions between the parties involved. The relics were discovered in northern India nearly 130 years ago by a British official, along with bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha himself.</p>

          <p>Britain is reportedly poised to sign a trade deal with the U.S., making it the first country to do so after the U.S. announced "reciprocal" tariffs. While the UK was spared higher tariffs, it was still hit with a baseline 10% levy. It remains uncertain whether the agreement will be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations. The U.S. Vice President previously indicated that the U.K. had a "good chance" of securing a trade deal, though Trump has contradicted White House officials by stating that the U.S. does not need to "sign deals" with trade partners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, marking the first such deal since imposing sweeping tariffs. The specifics of the agreement remain unclear, but it may involve lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as taxes on US technology companies. The announcement comes as a team of British trade negotiators landed in Washington to accelerate talks. This potential agreement follows Trump's recent announcement of tariffs on the film industry, which has created setbacks in trade talks.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are using powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world‚Äôs largest radio telescope and one of the most advanced radar systems, to search for water ice on the moon.

Smaller, isolated patches might also lie near the surface, the team wrote in the latest issue of the Chinese journal, Science Bulletin. The findings could help in the selection of landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of the proposed China-led research base on the moon.</p>
