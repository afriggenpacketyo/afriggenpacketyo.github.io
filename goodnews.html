          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines, violating the Voting Rights Act. The court ordered the state to continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of Alabama's second Black congressman. The judges criticized Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. This ruling follows a February trial and is expected to be appealed by the state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.

Pirro is a staunch supporter of Trump, who previously pardoned her ex-husband for tax evasion.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured a trade deal with the US, offering some relief from recent tariff increases, though it falls short of a comprehensive free trade agreement. While opponents accuse the Prime Minister of exaggerating the deal's benefits, it does provide better trading conditions for some sectors compared to the immediate past. The agreement avoids contentious issues like the Digital Services Tax and NHS involvement, but discussions continue on further tariff reductions. This deal represents a limited but positive step for the Prime Minister amid international and domestic challenges.</p>
