          <p>Oil prices experienced a 3% decrease following a ceasefire announcement between Israel and Iran, easing concerns about wider regional conflict.  The initial price increase following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was attributed to concerns about supply disruptions.  However, the ceasefire announcement tempered these concerns, although questions remain about implementation.  The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil shipping route, remains a significant risk.</p>

          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic advocates for a cautious approach to interest rate cuts, citing expected price increases and a stable job market.  He believes the Fed should wait until late 2025 to assess the impact of tariffs and other policies before considering a rate cut.  This contrasts with some other Fed officials who suggest earlier cuts.  Bostic's view emphasizes the need to ensure inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>
