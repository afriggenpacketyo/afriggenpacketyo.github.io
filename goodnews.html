        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds as investment options. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices during market hours, while mutual funds are priced at the end of the day and bought/sold directly. Both can track benchmark indices or specific sectors, but ETFs generally have lower expense ratios and no minimum investment thresholds. Financial experts often recommend beginners start with an S&P 500 index fund (either ETF or mutual fund) and then diversify with a few individual stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that it is easier for students with disabilities to sue schools for violating their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The case centered on Ava Tharpe, a teenager with epilepsy whose new school refused to accommodate her needs after moving to Minnesota. The court found that the family did not need to prove "bad faith" or "gross misjudgment" by school officials to seek compensatory damages under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. This decision lowers the burden of proof for students seeking to enforce their rights in court.</p>

Meta alleges that Joy Timeline made multiple attempts to circumvent the ad review process.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a family can sue law enforcement for a wrong-house raid. The case involves Trina Martin, her son, and her partner, whose Atlanta home was wrongly raided by FBI and SWAT agents in 2017. The family sued the FBI and individual agents, and the Supreme Court addressed whether the wrong-house raid falls within the circumstances where the federal government can be sued. The ruling makes it easier for families to seek legal recourse in such situations.</p>
