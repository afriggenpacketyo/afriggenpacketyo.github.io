          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to offer undocumented immigrants $1,000 and travel assistance if they voluntarily return to their home countries. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest, most cost-effective way for immigrants to avoid arrest, also noting that it is a 70% savings for US taxpayers. The administration promotes this initiative as a dignified departure option that may preserve the possibility of legal re-entry into the United States in the future. This measure is part of President Trump's broader effort to prioritize mass deportations, although the actual number of deportations has slightly lagged behind the previous administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow money in the current high-interest rate environment may find a home equity line of credit (HELOC) an appealing option. Lenders typically evaluate HELOC applications based on sufficient home equity, a strong credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio, and stable income and employment. Prospective borrowers can improve their chances of approval by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant. Despite the challenges, many homeowners with substantial equity may still qualify for a HELOC, offering a flexible borrowing tool.</p>

          <p>Credit card holders facing debt should explore various relief solutions instead of defaulting or filing for bankruptcy. Simply halting payments can lead to penalties, wage garnishment, and lawsuits, while bankruptcy has long-lasting effects on credit scores. Viable alternatives include credit card debt forgiveness programs, debt management programs, debt consolidation loans, and balance transfer cards. The best option depends on individual circumstances, with cardholders encouraged to research and choose an alternative that suits their financial needs to regain independence.</p>

Light from the waxing moon may wash out fainter meteors, but under optimal conditions, 10-15 meteors per hour can be seen just before dawn.
