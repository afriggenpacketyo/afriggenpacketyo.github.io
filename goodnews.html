          <p>Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting that he will recommend Greg Abel as his successor as CEO by year-end. Buffett, 94, will remain involved but cede operational and capital allocation decisions to Abel, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations. The announcement, a surprise to most board members, marks a significant transition for the conglomerate, which Buffett has led since 1965, transforming it into a $1.2 trillion powerhouse with diverse holdings. Buffett emphasized his intent to retain his Berkshire shares, citing confidence in Abel's leadership and the company's future prospects.</p>

          <h2>California Democrats Consider Mandatory Retirement Age for Politicians</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 15:34:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Democratic Party is considering a resolution to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians, reflecting concerns about leaders holding power past their prime. Sparked by issues surrounding older politicians like the late Senator Dianne Feinstein and former President Joseph R. Biden, the proposal aims to address the need for generational change. While some argue this is ageism, others point to instances where leaders' health has impacted their ability to serve effectively. The resolution faces opposition and would require a state law to be enacted, with Governor Gavin Newsom expressing skepticism about arbitrary age limits.</p>

          <p>The Daniel K. Inouye Telescope in Hawaii has achieved a milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this instrument will enhance the prediction of solar storms, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The VTF, designed by the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics in Germany, is described as the telescope's 'heart,' and its success promises to help mitigate the damage caused by geomagnetic disturbances. The telescope's construction faced protests due to its location on land considered sacred by native Hawaiians.</p>
