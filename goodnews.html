        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares dropped approximately 7% after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, which executives primarily attributed to an unexpected 10% tax dispute with Brazilian authorities on payments made outside the country. Despite this setback, which was not factored into previous forecasts, Netflix's revenue still grew by 17%, matching analyst expectations, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. The company also announced its best ad sales quarter ever and plans for consumer product partnerships for its hit animated film "KPop Demon Hunters." The company adjusted its full-year operating margin forecast due to the tax matter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 05:53:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The grandchildren of Ruth Ellis, the last woman executed in Britain in 1955, are actively seeking a posthumous pardon for her, asserting she was a victim of severe physical and emotional abuse by her lover, David Blakely, whom she ultimately killed. They contend that if her case occurred today, legal defenses like diminished responsibility or loss of control, introduced shortly after her execution, would have been applicable. The family's decades-long campaign aims to correct a historical injustice and acknowledge the devastating impact of domestic abuse on Ellis and her children. This article reflects a societal re-evaluation of past legal judgments through a modern understanding of domestic violence.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 05:52:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate held steady at 3.8% in September for the third consecutive month, lower than the Bank of England's 4% forecast, with food and non-alcoholic drink prices seeing their slowest increase in over a year. While this offers a "small glimmer of hope," prices are still rising, albeit more slowly, impacting household budgets. The September figure is crucial as it typically benchmarks benefit upratings, meaning millions could see a 3.8% increase next year, though the state pension will rise more due to the triple lock. This article details the ongoing cost of living challenges and the economic pressures facing UK households. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beyond Meat's stock has experienced an extraordinary surge of nearly 600% in three days, fueled by two key catalysts: a new deal to expand its "Beyond Burger" and "Beyond Chicken Pieces" into 2,000 Walmart stores, and its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF. This unexpected rally occurs despite the company's struggling fundamentals, including a 19.6% sales crash in the second quarter and recent layoffs. Analysts suggest the company is "shrinking to survive," focusing on cost-cutting and distribution. This article highlights a significant disconnect between market speculation and underlying business performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Methane, an odorless greenhouse gas, is a potent contributor to climate change, trapping 84 times more heat than CO2 over a 20-year period, and is responsible for 20-30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. While naturally occurring, 60% of emissions come from human activities, primarily agriculture and the energy sector through leaks, flaring, and venting. Solutions include simple fixes like repairing equipment and new regulations, such as the EU's mandate for companies to measure and reduce emissions. This article emphasizes the critical need for more action to meet global methane reduction goals.</p>
