          <h2>Major League Baseball Nears New Media Rights Deals with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing substantial new media rights deals with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, which are expected to significantly alter how fans access games. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. ESPN will reportedly receive a new $550 million package, encompassing digital out-of-market games and rights to five local teams. These agreements, designed to expand MLB's reach and financial partnerships, are a strategic move in response to the changing media consumption habits and traditional television's declining viewership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether (ETH) experienced a significant surge, trading near its record high, immediately following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual address from Jackson Hole. Powell's comments, suggesting that the "shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance," were interpreted as dovish by traders, leading to a "panicked repositioning" in the crypto market. This resulted in approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour, pushing its price further upward. The market reaction also saw shares of ether-focused companies like Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming jump, indicating a renewed momentum for crypto assets aligned with potential easing of monetary policy.</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies Flexibility for Electric Vehicle Tax Credit as Deadline Nears</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 15:12:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, but the IRS has provided a crucial clarification for car buyers. Shoppers can still qualify for the credit if they enter a binding contract to purchase a vehicle before the deadline, even if delivery occurs afterward. A payment, including a nominal downpayment or trade-in, is also required before September 30. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those buying vehicles from out-of-state or ordering unmanufactured cars, potentially boosting EV sales in the short term before the credit's full termination by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Intel shares surged by approximately 6% after President Trump announced that the U.S. government has agreed to take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker. Trump indicated the government would acquire about 10% of the company, framing it as a beneficial deal for Intel. While White House officials clarified that discussions are ongoing and no explicit agreement has been reached, the move signals a notable shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government actively investing in corporate America. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously stated the government sought an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, with the stake being non-voting.</p>

          <h2>'Splitsville' Movie Review: Comedy on Modern Relationships Falls Short of Ambition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 14:44:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The movie "Splitsville," directed by and co-starring Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, attempts to satirize modern marriage and male friendship but ultimately falls short of its comedic aspirations. The plot follows Carey, whose wife wants a divorce, leading him to seek solace with friends in an open relationship, resulting in complicated jealousies. While outwardly a satire of bourgeois aspirations, the film is primarily focused on the absurdities of male friendship, often indulging in the very impulses it seeks to parody. Despite elevating performances from Adria Arjona and Dakota Johnson, the movie suffers from a self-regarding tone and an overly outlandish fight scene, struggling to deliver on its deeper meaning.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated a cautious openness to possible interest rate cuts in his Jackson Hole speech, citing "sweeping changes" in policy and a "shifting balance of risks." While noting a resilient economy and strong labor market, Powell highlighted rising downside dangers and the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, a stagflation scenario the Fed aims to avoid. He stated that current restrictive policy allows the Fed to "proceed carefully" and that adjusting the stance "may warrant" cuts, sending stocks soaring. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and underscored the critical importance of the central bank's independence from political demands.</p>

He expressed the immense strain of separating his captaincy duties from his personal play, noting that the Ryder Cup is constantly on his mind. Despite widespread support for his playing ability, Bradley emphasizes that the ultimate decision will prioritize what is best for the team to regain the trophy, even if it means not playing himself.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, aiming to reduce trade tensions. This decision follows a call with President Trump and aligns Canada's tariffs with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by ending levies on compliant goods, effective September 1. However, Canada will maintain 25% tariffs on American autos, steel, and aluminum, mirroring existing U.S. tariffs on these sectors. The move is expected to re-establish free trade for the majority of goods between the two nations, despite ongoing challenges in negotiating trade agreements for key industries like auto and metals.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced hesitation about lowering interest rates, emphasizing that inflation remains a significant threat despite market enthusiasm for potential cuts. Hammack, while acknowledging Chair Jerome Powell's openness to policy easing, stressed the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring inflation back to the 2% target, which has been exceeded for four years. She also noted her personal belief that the "neutral" interest rate is higher than many other Fed officials perceive. Hammack's comments highlight a differing perspective within the Fed, cautioning against accommodative policies that could reignite inflationary pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has agreed to pay £2.9 million in compensation to over 7,700 Kenyans affected by a fire caused during a British military training exercise four years ago. The out-of-court settlement concludes a lengthy legal battle where claimants reported property loss and health complications from smoke inhalation. A British High Commission spokesperson called the 2021 Lolldaiga conservancy fire "extremely regrettable" and noted the UK's efforts to resolve the claims. While the lawyer praised the outcome, some clients felt the sums were insufficient, and proving health damages was challenging due to lost evidence and other smoke sources. The UK military continues exercises in the area, contributing to the Kenyan economy despite past controversies involving soldier conduct.</p>
