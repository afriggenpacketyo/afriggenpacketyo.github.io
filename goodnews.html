          <p>A yellow weather warning has been issued for thunderstorms and potential flooding in parts of England and Wales, following the driest start to spring in 69 years. The Met Office forecasts up to 50mm of rain could fall within a few hours, potentially causing delays to train and bus services. Despite the brief change, temperatures are expected to remain mild, and settled conditions are predicted to return for the rest of the week, with temperatures reaching up to 23C in some areas. Last week, the Environment Agency cautioned water companies to improve safeguarding water supplies after weeks of dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has returned to Massachusetts after spending six weeks in ICE detention in Louisiana. A federal judge ordered her release on bail after she was detained for allegedly violating her visa due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and stated her belief in the American justice system, while also highlighting the plight of other women in immigration detention. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, and she will continue her case in court.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport for several weeks to address ongoing radar outages, flight delays, and air traffic controller shortages. Duffy stated he will meet with airlines to determine the extent of the reduction, focusing on afternoons with heavier international arrivals. The FAA also experienced a radar issue in Philadelphia and an equipment outage in Atlanta. Duffy also intends to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 and offer a 20% bonus for those who stay on the job, as the Trump administration proposes a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system.</p>
