          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records at the US Open, but questions remain about his physical ability to endure the tournament and win a 25th Grand Slam title. Despite playing himself into good form after a rusty start, Djokovic has been plagued by various physical issues, requiring trainer attention for his neck, shoulder, and back. The article notes his upcoming quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a dominant 10-0 record. Ultimately, his success hinges on whether his aging body can withstand the strain of consecutive five-set matches.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially signed Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in a deal reportedly worth an initial 21 million euros. The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the Premier League club, calling the move a "dream come true." Lammens, who has yet to earn a senior cap for Belgium, made 64 appearances for Antwerp and was instrumental in their 2023 Belgian Super Cup victory. Manchester United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, praised Lammens as an excellent young goalkeeper with significant potential, noting the club secured his signature despite interest from other teams.</p>
