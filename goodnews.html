          <p>The new iPhone 17 has gone on sale worldwide, drawing significant crowds from Beijing to London and showing strong initial demand. However, the launch occurs as Apple faces intensified competition in key markets like China from rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Beyond the sales figures, the company is also under pressure from investors and analysts to deliver on its ambitious artificial intelligence promises, which are seen as crucial for its future growth. The global release is a critical test of Apple's ability to maintain its market leadership and ecosystem loyalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees living in Germany has decreased, according to new government statistics. The refugee population fell by approximately 50,000 during the first half of 2025, from 3.55 million to 3.50 million. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including an increase in deportations, voluntary departures, and a significant number of naturalizations, particularly among Syrian refugees who have been granted German citizenship. The figures provide a new snapshot of migration trends within the country.</p>

The market's reaction reflects ongoing investor assessment of Japan's economic stability and the central bank's cautious monetary policy stance. (not investment advice)</p>
