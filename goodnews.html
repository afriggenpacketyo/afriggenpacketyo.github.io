          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a key component of its lunar ambitions set for 2030. The spacecraft underwent a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where its escape engines ignited to propel the return capsule to a safe altitude. The successful test ensures crew safety during potential rocket failures at lift-off, simulating rapid extraction from dangerous launch phases. This marks China's first such test since 1998, signaling significant progress in its space program.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with substantial signing bonuses, potentially reaching $100 million, and lucrative annual compensation packages. Despite these aggressive efforts, Altman stated that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted Meta's offers. He acknowledged Meta's perception of OpenAI as a major competitor and praised their determination to innovate. These recruitment moves come as Meta seeks to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities, particularly for its "superintelligence" AI lab, following delays in the release of its latest AI model.</p>

          <p>Australia is set to lift its ban on blood and plasma donations for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are expected to increase the donation pool by approximately 625,000 people. Under the new rules, most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of gender or sexuality. The move is seen as a significant milestone in reducing stigma and increasing the supply of much-needed plasma. </p>
