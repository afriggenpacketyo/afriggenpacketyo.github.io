          <p>Rugby league legend Billy Boston is set to receive a knighthood at Buckingham Palace, marking the sport's first such honor in its 130-year history. The Cardiff-born player, known for his stellar career with Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, will be knighted due to concerns over his health. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy described the knighthood as an historic milestone and long-overdue recognition for rugby league's contribution to national life. Boston's knighthood follows growing frustration over the lack of top honors for rugby league, with some suggesting snobbery was a factor.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star. Lively had previously filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for bringing those complaints. Baldoni's lawsuit centered on claims that Lively stole the film from him and promoted a false narrative of sexual assault, but the judge found that Baldoni had not adequately alleged wrongful extortion or proved defamation. Lively's lawyers called the opinion a total victory and vindication for Lively, while Baldoni has been given the opportunity to amend and refile allegations related to interference with contracts.</p>
