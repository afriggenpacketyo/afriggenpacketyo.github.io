          <p>In Bihar, India, where inadequate cold-chain infrastructure leads to significant crop spoilage, solar-powered cold storage facilities are emerging as a potential solution for small-scale farmers. Companies like Inficold are installing units that allow farmers to preserve perishable goods for weeks, reducing waste and enabling them to sell produce when market prices are more favorable. However, challenges remain, including the high upfront investment costs and the need for community-based models and government support to make the technology accessible and economically viable for all farmers.</p>

          <p>Sana Javeri Kadri, founder of the ethical spice company Diaspora Co., is facing a significant challenge from the Trump administration's new tariffs on Indian products. Her business model is built on sourcing high-quality, single-origin spices directly from regenerative farms in India and Sri Lanka, paying farmers a living wage to decolonize the trade. The recently imposed tariffs threaten to increase her costs substantially, forcing potential price hikes and jeopardizing the mission of a company that prioritizes sustainability and fair labor practices.</p>

Through the intimate perspective of his mother, Mary Guibert, the film explores his upbringing in a Latino household, which was largely overshadowed by comparisons to his estranged and famous father, Tim Buckley. The article highlights how his multicultural background and complex family dynamics deeply influenced his empathetic and genre-spanning musical style.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel, who turned 50 on Thursday, was knocked to the ground while attempting to break up a fight between players during a joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings. Video showed Vrabel inserting himself into the middle of the scrum before being momentarily toppled as the group moved.
