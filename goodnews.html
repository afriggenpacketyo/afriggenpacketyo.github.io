The Football Association of Wales confirmed all players and staff on board were uninjured, though the driver of the other vehicle required medical attention. As a result, the team's scheduled training at the arena was cancelled, with head coach Rhian Wilkinson and captain Angharad James not being on the bus at the time. The team is reassessing its preparations for their upcoming Euro 2025 qualifier against France.</p>

          <p>A year after his Conservative Party's significant election defeat, former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. The investment bank announced that Sunak will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical trends. Sunak, who previously worked at the bank in the early 2000s, will donate his pay to his numeracy skills charity. The appointment was delayed by a government watchdog, which imposed restrictions for another year to prevent unfair influence or conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring all passengers to remove their shoes during security screening. A recent memo indicates the new procedure, allowing travelers in general security lines to keep their shoes on, will roll out at major airports before expanding nationwide. The change aims to expedite the screening process, a goal the agency has pursued for years. Passengers who trigger alarms at scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional checks.</p>

          <p>The historic Bayeux Tapestry will be loaned to the United Kingdom from France, marking its first return since its creation in the 11th century. The 70-meter-long embroidery, which depicts the Norman conquest of England, will be exhibited at the British Museum starting in 2026. The loan is part of a cultural exchange that will see significant British artifacts, like the Sutton Hoo treasures, travel to France. This landmark agreement symbolizes the enduring cultural relationship between the two nations and is expected to be a major exhibition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A monthly survey by the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about inflation have subsided significantly. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% for the upcoming year, a decrease from a peak of 3.6% earlier in the year and a return to January levels. This suggests that concerns about President Trump's tariff policies leading to a sharp price spike have receded. While the overall outlook eased, expectations for price increases in specific areas like medical care and college education remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

It highlights his successful and unusual coalition with City Comptroller Brad Lander, a self-described "progressive Zionist," despite their differing views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The article argues that by prioritizing shared local goals over ideological purity tests, they built a broad base of support. This strategy of acknowledging differences while working together is presented as a more effective political approach than exclusionary tactics sometimes favored by progressives.</p>

The government anticipates that new powers allowing French police to intervene with boats in shallow water will be implemented soon. Negotiations are ongoing for a potential "one in, one out" returns deal, which would allow the UK to return migrants to France in exchange for accepting certain asylum seekers. The discussions come as the number of Channel crossings in 2025 has already set a new record.</p>
