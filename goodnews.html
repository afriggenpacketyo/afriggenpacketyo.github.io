          <p>Actress Kristin Davis recently shared her experience on the set of the 1990s drama "Melrose Place," revealing that one of her co-stars refused to speak to her. While she did not name the individual, Davis described the set as competitive and intimidating, though she noted the person is now friendly to her. The experience influenced her to be a "welcoming committee" for guest actors on "Sex and the City" to prevent others from feeling the same discomfort. Davis also recalled her surprise at being cast in the role over future Oscar-winner Hilary Swank.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving military procurement. The scheme allegedly involved inflating the prices of drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence to the country's anti-corruption bodies after public protests against a government bill that sought to curtail their power.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at $420 billion. Originally conceived as a platform for "programmable money," it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are increasingly building on Ethereum, valuing its stability and programmability for tokenizing assets. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin notes the platform's success has surpassed expectations but warns against the risk of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The case stems from sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that led to protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The administration criticized the ruling, stating that it undermines law enforcement's ability to remove criminals.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Luka Doncic has officially signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, ending speculation about his future with the team. The 26-year-old guard, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself on social media, expressing his commitment to bringing championships to Los Angeles. The Lakers' general manager, Rob Pelinka, praised Doncic as a "transcendent" player and the future leader of the franchise. As part of the announcement, Doncic also pledged a $5 million donation to support young athletes.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. Rather than choosing a name themselves, they are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help select one, aiming for a title that encapsulates the party's core values. The new entity cannot field candidates until it is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules on party names. This unconventional approach is part of a broader effort to build a grassroots political movement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have solidified Luka Doncic as the future of the franchise with a three-year, $165 million contract extension, a move that signals a significant shift in the team's dynamics. While the commitment to the 26-year-old star was expected, it intensifies questions about the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article suggests that by formally passing the torch to Doncic, the Lakers have created an uncertain situation for James, who is accustomed to being the focal point of any team he plays for.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling "completely out of his depth" when delivering tragic news to patients. Seeing his stepfather pass away at 54 before he could enjoy retirement solidified his resolve to change paths. He described leaving his hospital job for the last time as a "weight lifted," setting him on the path to becoming a well-known entertainer.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it may adopt a more careful strategy in the future. This shift contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. Computer scientist Andrew Ng suggests that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development. Meta's potential change in course reflects the evolving strategic landscape of global AI competition.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift during World War II, but perished before reaching the UK. While legend claimed it died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Researchers examining the ship's logs found that the water and air temperatures rose well above the safe threshold for the animal as the ship crossed the equator, indicating it likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of theme parks and attractions to fuel local economies and boost consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, with over 4,400 similar facilities already operating nationwide. According to the global theme park industry association, the number of attractions is forecast to grow significantly in the coming years. This strategy aims to create a powerful economic multiplier effect, where revenue from parks drives broader growth in the surrounding regions. (not investment advice)</p>
