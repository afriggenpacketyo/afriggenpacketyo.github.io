          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by the fall of 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state approximately $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will not release inmates early but will transfer them to other prisons. The site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, may be repurposed, with local officials hopeful it could be restored to its historic form.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policymakers regarding whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark for the household consumption rate, which stood at a relatively low 39.6% of GDP in 2023, is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand. However, other experts express skepticism, questioning the operational feasibility of such metrics as official policy goals. This discussion reflects Beijing's ongoing efforts to rebalance its economy by strengthening internal consumption as a primary driver of growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a challenging start to his MLB career followed by a shoulder injury, Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing promising signs of a turnaround. The Japanese phenom, who had a 4.72 ERA before being sidelined, has been progressing in his throwing program and is expected to begin a minor-league rehab assignment soon. Coaches are encouraged by adjustments to his mechanics and the addition of a new two-seam fastball to his arsenal, with his velocity returning to the mid-90s. While his role is uncertain, a healthy and effective Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth for the Dodgers' postseason ambitions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that the states would face "irreparable harm" if the funds were repurposed, as the program is vital for projects like flood-proofing infrastructure. This decision temporarily protects critical funding for communities preparing for the impacts of natural disasters.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, a combination of two other strains and colloquially named "Stratus" (XFG), is spreading in the United States, now accounting for 14% of cases. First detected in Southeast Asia, the variant has seen a rapid increase in prevalence globally. The World Health Organization has classified the public health risk as "low," and existing vaccines are expected to remain effective against severe disease. While there is no evidence of significantly different or more severe symptoms, experts note its mutations may help it evade some immune responses, warranting continued monitoring by health officials.</p>

Property crimes also fell significantly, with motor vehicle thefts down by 18.6%. While experts credit various factors, the report provides strong statistical evidence of improving public safety nationwide, though some crime categories like aggravated assault remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. This measure aims to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law, which takes effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027, applies to both new and old buildings. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, positioning the ordinance as a necessary public health protection.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are bringing back one of their franchise's most productive players, agreeing to a one-year deal with veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen. Allen, who was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap move, returns to the team where he spent 11 seasons and became the second all-time leading receiver. The move addresses a need for an experienced pass-catcher following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. The six-time Pro Bowl selection is expected to provide a reliable target for quarterback Justin Herbert and mentor a young receiving corps.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have announced that rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders will start their first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. This decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed fourth on the depth chart and the team recently signed another quarterback. However, injuries to the team's other young quarterbacks have created an opportunity for the fifth-round draft pick. After a highly successful college career under his father, Deion Sanders, Shedeur Sanders will now have a prominent chance to prove he belongs on the final roster in a professional setting.</p>
