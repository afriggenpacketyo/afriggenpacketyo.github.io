Soliman's family was taken into custody by ICE agents, prompting legal action to prevent their removal. The judge cited potential irreparable harm if deportation occurred without due process. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives violates democratic justice principles. A hearing is scheduled for June 13 to further consider the case.</p>

This operation, funded by a federal grant, aims to clean up derelict vessels that have drifted onto the island, which is of cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The DNR has removed 14 vessels in this largest operation of its kind, opting for airlift to minimize disruption to the marine environment. Since 2002, the department has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels, with hundreds more still remaining.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed light on how birds surpassed dinosaurs in conquering the skies. The study focused on the evolution of flight feathers during the Cretaceous period, revealing essential features that enabled birds to generate thrust and lift. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed the structural details of these ancient feathers, providing insights into the development of flight capabilities. While most feathered dinosaurs could not fly, this research highlights the critical role of feather evolution in the emergence of avian flight.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the UK have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a baby's gut may protect them from dangerous infections. The study found that infants with Bifidobacterium longum in their gut had a significantly lower risk of being hospitalized for lung infections. Researchers believe this early encounter with beneficial microbes is crucial for immune system development. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery rather than cesarean section.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups by granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting the restart of an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara. The order prevents Sable from working on its onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review. The ruling delays Sable's timeline for resuming commercial operations and underscores ongoing concerns about potential environmental risks.</p>

Drug safety experts in the UK say it's not known whether these medications could harm an unborn baby. While the advice already appears in patient information leaflets, there are concerns that the growing popularity of these "skinny jabs" means many women aren't using them safely or getting proper medical advice. The UK drugs regulator is worried that these medicines are being purchased from unregulated sellers without any medical advice.</p>

Public health officials are monitoring mosquito populations and advising residents to eliminate standing water and repair leaky faucets to help control the spread of these pests.</p>
