          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with the investigation by counter-terrorism officers into a fire at Prime Minister Keir Starmer's home. The Daily Telegraph reports police are investigating whether an arson attack at a second home linked to Starmer is related. The Daily Express focuses on Starmer's new immigration policy, questioning its effectiveness. The Guardian highlights the backlash from MPs who say Starmer's comments echo far-right rhetoric, while The Times includes a picture of migrants picked up in Dover. The Financial Times leads with the US and China agreeing to slash tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days.</p>

          <p>Former professional cricketer Arul Suppiah discusses his struggles with anorexia, a serious mental health condition often associated with young women. Suppiah's health kick in 2017 spiraled into an eating disorder, leading to excessive exercise and avoidance of social situations involving food. Advised by his doctor to take time off, Suppiah faced a warning from his psychiatrist about potential hospitalization under the Mental Health Act if he didn't improve. He has since been working to turn things around.</p>

          <p>A recent Japanese government survey indicates that approximately half of respondents believed at least one instance of false information on social media after encountering it. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications emphasizes the need to improve media literacy, as people are easily misled by unsourced online information. One in four who encountered false information shared it with family, friends, or on social media. The survey highlights the importance of critical thinking and verifying information before dissemination.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, the countries have agreed to lower tariff rates. For the next 90 days, Chinese goods shipped to the US will be subject to at least 30% in tariffs, and American exports will receive a minimum 10% in duties. However, these rates do not include previous tariffs held over from the first iteration of the trade war. The baseline rate is about 50%, derived by adding the 20% in tariffs imposed during Trump's first term plus the 30% in new duties.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports on the anticlimactic auction of the Riggio family's art collection at Christie's in New York. The sale, seen as a bellwether for the art market, showed little enthusiastic bidding, with many objects presold to guaranteed bids. Experts attribute the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. The top lot, a Mondrian painting, sold for $47.6 million, falling short of the previous record. Some paintings by Richter, van Gogh, and Frankenthaler sold above estimates, but the market showed weakness for Warhol.</p>

          <p>Jalen Brunson scored 39 points, leading the New York Knicks to a 121-113 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of the NBA playoffs. The Knicks are now one win away from their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 25 years. The Celtics face the challenge of overcoming a 3-1 deficit and potentially without Jayson Tatum, who suffered a leg injury. The Knicks outscored the Celtics 37-23 in the third quarter, setting up a thrilling final period.</p>
