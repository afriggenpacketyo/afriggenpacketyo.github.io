          <p>President Trump's public statements regarding U.S. mediation between India and Pakistan have strained relations with India, contradicting claims of trade offers and equal treatment between the two nations. Indian officials refuted Trump's assertions that he offered increased trade in exchange for a cease-fire, emphasizing that trade was never discussed. India is concerned about appearing to halt military efforts under outside pressure, especially in its long-standing conflict with Pakistan. The article highlights the delicate balance in U.S.-India relations and the potential for miscommunication to undermine trust.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the potential deployment of French nuclear weapons in other European countries, amidst growing concerns about European security and the reliability of the U.S. nuclear commitment. Macron emphasized that any expansion of France's nuclear deterrence would be conditional, ensuring France's defense capabilities remain intact and ultimate control stays with the French president. Germany and Poland have shown interest in the proposal, driven by fears of Russian aggression, but Macron stressed the importance of avoiding escalation with Moscow.
