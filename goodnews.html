          <h2>Rocket Lab Stock Surges Amid Successful Launches and European Space Agency Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:07:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab jumped nearly 11%, continuing a significant rally that has seen the stock almost double in the past two months. This recent surge is attributed to a series of successful rocket launches and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company, a competitor to SpaceX, has seen its stock rise 63% year-to-date, fueled by increasing demand for its Electron rocket. CEO Peter Beck stated that the company is now producing a new rocket approximately every 15 days to meet this demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant policy shift, pledging to facilitate the sale of new U.S. weapons to NATO allies, who will then provide them to Ukraine. While specific details were limited, President Trump confirmed the deal includes Patriot air defense systems and that a "big portion" would soon be sent to Kyiv. This arrangement allows weapons to flow to Ukraine without direct U.S. payment, a point Trump emphasized. Concurrently, Trump threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on Russia's trading partners if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days, marking a new strategy to pressure Moscow.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Surpasses $120,000, Reaching New Record High Amid Legislative Momentum</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:03:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new all-time high, briefly trading above $123,000 before settling near $120,000. The rally is attributed to significant inflows into bitcoin ETFs, driven by growing institutional interest and optimism surrounding upcoming U.S. crypto legislation. The House of Representatives is set to deliberate on several crypto-focused bills, including the GENIUS Act, which aims to provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest this institutional buying could propel the cryptocurrency even higher, though potential Fed interest rate hikes pose a risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has recorded a 4% decrease in its homeless population for 2025, marking the second year in a row with a decline. The annual count revealed a more significant 10% drop in the number of people living unsheltered on the streets. Officials attribute this progress to substantial financial investment and a focused strategy on clearing encampments and moving individuals into interim housing like hotels and shelters. While overall homelessness shows a downward trend, the number of people in temporary shelters has increased, highlighting the ongoing challenge of transitioning individuals into permanent housing.</p>

          <p>A new company named Jams has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, aiming to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Backed by high-profile athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, Jams is marketing itself as a healthier alternative, free of seed oils, artificial ingredients, and high-fructose corn syrup, while containing more protein. The product will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide at a slightly higher price point than its main competitor. The company hopes to capture the health-conscious consumer and athlete market, a significant consumer base for convenient snacks.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 as part of a significant effort to combat spam and inauthentic content. The company is targeting accounts that impersonate large content creators and those that use AI tools to mass-produce low-quality posts, often called "AI slop." In addition to the removals, Meta is taking action against 500,000 other accounts by reducing their content's distribution and demoting their comments. This initiative aims to promote original content and improve the authenticity of the user experience on the platform.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill designed to establish a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation, part of a 'Crypto Week' in Congress, aims to create clear rules for how banks and companies can issue these digital currencies, which are typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue the bill will bolster investor confidence, enhance the dollar's global standing, and encourage market competition. However, some critics worry it could compromise crypto's decentralized nature and lacks sufficient guardrails against potential corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan, which includes much-needed Patriot air defense systems, is seen in Kyiv as a significant improvement in relations with Washington. Conversely, officials and pro-war bloggers in Moscow have largely dismissed Trump's accompanying threat of sanctions if a peace deal isn't reached in 50 days, calling it "hot air."
