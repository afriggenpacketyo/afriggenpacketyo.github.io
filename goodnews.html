          <p>The House GOP is pushing forward with President Trump's budget package, facing divisions over Medicaid and tax cuts. Three committees voted to advance key parts of the bill, including changes to Medicaid, food stamps, and tax provisions. Republicans are struggling to reach a consensus on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, with blue state representatives seeking an increase. The Energy and Commerce Committee debated Medicaid cuts, while the Agriculture Committee considered changes to food stamp eligibility, and the House aims to vote on the bill next week, though Senate approval remains uncertain.</p>
