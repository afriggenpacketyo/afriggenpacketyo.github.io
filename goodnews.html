          <p>Stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze has achieved massive success, becoming the highest-grossing comic in the country and selling out arenas. In a recent profile, he discusses his journey from being cut from his high school basketball team to hosting the Emmy Awards and starring in his first feature film. Bargatze, known for his family-friendly, "clean comic" style, attributes his success in part to a sense of calling and a desire to provide entertainment that families can enjoy together without concern. Despite his fame, he remains grounded in his Nashville roots and plans to build a larger entertainment world there, including a potential theme park.</p>

          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in the game's history, an estimated $1.8 billion, was won on Saturday night by two ticket holders in Texas and Missouri. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The massive prize had grown over three months without a winner, marking a record number of consecutive drawings. The winners will have the choice between an annuity paid over 29 years or a lump-sum cash payment estimated at $826.4 million before taxes. This win ends a drought that began after a jackpot was last claimed in California on May 31.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government announced it has secured a deal with the United States for the release of over 300 of its nationals who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested 475 people suspected of working illegally at the facility, which is still under construction. The raid was part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices and was described as one of the largest single-site enforcement operations in Homeland Security Investigations history. The released workers are expected to be returned to South Korea via a charter plane.</p>

          <p>The US Eagles have been eliminated from the Women's Rugby World Cup despite a decisive 60-0 victory over Samoa. Australia's subsequent performance against England secured them a quarter-final spot based on points differential. While disappointed, the US team's performance has highlighted the emergence of promising young stars who are expected to form the core of the team for years to come. Players like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in the tournament, signal a bright future for American rugby, with many young athletes developing through a strong collegiate system before moving to professional leagues.</p>

          <h2>Pediatrician Highlights Healthy Sleep Habits as Key to a Child's Future Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 09:05:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical things parents can do for their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional development and are linked to better concentration and emotional regulation in older children. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, swaddling, and white noise. He also recommends that both parents get involved in the settling process and maintain a flexible routine to help babies learn to sleep soundly.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Right-Wing Preppers Should Embrace Solar Power for Self-Sufficiency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 09:00:22 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that individuals concerned with self-sufficiency and preparing for societal disruptions, often associated with right-wing politics, should logically be the biggest proponents of solar energy. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex and vulnerable supply chains, solar panels offer true energy independence by harnessing a readily available resource. The article contrasts the difficulty of storing and sourcing fuels like diesel with the simplicity and long-term reliability of solar panels connected to home batteries. This technology aligns perfectly with a hyper-individualist or conservative desire for self-reliance, making a home a defensible and sustainable castle.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as the head coach of the University of North Carolina football team with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed reports of animosity with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming that he has banned their scouts from attending UNC practices. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure. The win provided a much-needed boost for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss to TCU.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Continued Use of Coal Power Serves as a 'Shock Absorber' for Renewables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's simultaneous expansion of coal power and renewable energy is a pragmatic strategy, not a climate policy contradiction. While China is adding record amounts of solar capacity, issues like grid limitations and intermittent power generation from renewables create instability. In this context, coal-fired power plants act as a crucial 'shock absorber,' providing reliable backup energy to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewable sources are unavailable. This approach allows grid operators the confidence to rapidly approve and integrate vast new renewable projects while maintaining a stable energy supply for the country.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vinted, the popular online marketplace for second-hand clothing, originated from a simple problem faced by its co-founder, Milda Mitkutė, who needed to downsize her wardrobe before moving. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly developed a website in Lithuania to sell her excess clothes, which proved immediately successful. The platform's word-of-mouth popularity led to expansion into Germany and eventually grew into a global business. Now valued at over a billion dollars, Vinted has become a major player in the sustainable fashion movement, capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in buying and selling pre-owned items.</p>

          <h2>Powerball Data Reveals How State Taxes Significantly Impact Jackpot Winnings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent $1.8 billion jackpot win, an analysis of Powerball data shows that a winner's take-home prize can vary dramatically depending on their state's tax laws. While all winnings are subject to a federal tax of about 37%, some states levy additional income taxes that can significantly reduce the final amount. States like California, Florida, and Texas impose no state tax on lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the maximum amount possible. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, can claim over 10% of the prize, resulting in a substantially smaller payout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hypertension: Understanding and Controlling the 'Silent Killer' Linked to Stroke and Dementia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are emphasizing the importance of early treatment for hypertension, or high blood pressure, a condition affecting over half of Americans by age 40. Often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms, untreated hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia. New guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Strategies to control blood pressure include a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, limiting alcohol, stress reduction, and, when necessary, various medications to protect long-term health.</p>
