          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in the Netherlands, shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, though he later stated both countries violated it. During the summit, Trump aimed to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump on his actions in Iran and on securing new defense spending levels. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a key concern for NATO members, with discussions ongoing about whether to designate Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of books to train its artificial intelligence model Claude was "fair use" and "transformative." The judge stated that the large language models (LLMs) did not reproduce the creative elements or identifiable expressive style of the copyrighted works. This decision is a significant win for AI companies, as it establishes legal limits and opportunities for the industry regarding the use of copyrighted works in developing and training LLMs. The ruling supports the idea that training LLMs to generate new text is a transformative purpose.</p>

          <p>Home prices nationally rose just 2.7% in April compared with the previous year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index, marking the smallest gain in nearly two years. Rising supply and slowing demand in the housing market are contributing to the cooling prices, with some previously hot markets like Tampa and Dallas turning negative. Higher mortgage rates are keeping potential monthly payments near generational highs, pricing out many buyers, and while prices are weakening, they are not at risk of major declines.

There is evidence of a spending split within NATO, with countries closer to Russia spending more, and even the lowest spenders, like Spain, are planning to increase their contributions.
