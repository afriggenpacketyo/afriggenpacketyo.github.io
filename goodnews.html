          <p>West Ham midfielder Edson Alvarez has officially joined Turkish club Fenerbahce on a loan deal, a move confirmed recently, marking a significant shift for the Mexican international. This transfer sees the 25-year-old depart the Premier League, where he had been a key figure since his arrival, for the Turkish Super Lig, seeking new opportunities and consistent playing time. Alvarez, renowned for his robust defensive midfield capabilities and extensive international experience, is expected to significantly bolster Fenerbahce's squad as they contend for domestic honors and pursue success in European competitions. This strategic loan aims to benefit both the player's development and the club's ambitious objectives for the upcoming season, reflecting a mutual desire for new challenges.</p>

          <p>A central Berlin street, Mohrenstraße, is set to be renamed after a prolonged five-year legal battle, honoring Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to receive a European doctorate. The term "Moor" historically carried derogatory connotations, stemming from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as "court moors." Despite initial lawsuits from residents seeking to block the change, the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg ultimately upheld the renaming, which was scheduled to coincide with the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade. This significant decision represents a broader societal effort towards decolonization, acknowledging past injustices, and celebrating Black history and resilience in Germany.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that "South Park" has become the most important TV show for satirizing the second Trump administration, succeeding where many other topical comedies have faltered. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's approach avoids "clapter" – comedy seeking approval over laughter – by delivering gratifyingly mean caricatures of figures like Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem. The show employs unique techniques, such as depicting Trump through repurposed photos and giving him Saddam Hussein's former sexual partner, Satan, to highlight his perceived dictatorial aspirations. This season also effectively lampoons broader cultural trends, like tech-bro addiction to ChatGPT, demonstrating its continued relevance.</p>

          <p>Japan's recently announced initiative to develop a logistics network across the Indian Ocean and Africa risks overlapping and clashing with China's Belt and Road Initiative, according to this article. It argues that instead of fostering competition, which could lead to wasted resources and incompatible technical standards, Japan should pursue cooperation with China on infrastructure development. With the United States appearing less engaged and Europe distracted by its own continental issues, the resurgence of these "infrastructure wars" highlights a missed opportunity for multilateral development banks to coordinate global efforts. Collaboration would ultimately foster greater economic influence and regional stability, rather than exacerbating geopolitical tensions through rivalry.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek enters the US Open as the favorite for her seventh Grand Slam title, following a triumphant grass-court season and a strong hard-court performance, recovering from a previous doping case. Despite Aryna Sabalenka holding the world No. 1 ranking, her consistency in major finals remains a challenge, while Coco Gauff has struggled with her serve and made coaching changes. In men's tennis, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz continue to dominate, aiming for their third consecutive Grand Slam final encounter this year. Novak Djokovic, at 38, faces physical challenges, while Ben Shelton emerges as a strong contender after a Masters 1000 title win.</p>

          <h2>Turkey Considers New Regulations to Curb Food Waste at Hotel Buffets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 03:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is considering new regulations to prevent food waste at all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional large breakfasts, with advisors to President Erdogan working on proposals. The country annually wastes 8.7 million tons of food, with each person throwing away about 102 kilograms, a significant concern given Turkey's economic problems. Critics argue that lavish "Serpme Kahvalti" breakfasts, often serving 15-20 small plates per guest, lead to excessive waste. Proposed changes include allowing guests to customize their breakfast and more flexible billing. While private households are the biggest culprits globally, these reforms aim to address waste in the tourism sector, a major economic driver.</p>

          <p>At 30, self-made billionaire Lucy Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and CEO of Passes, adheres to an intense daily routine prioritizing extreme productivity over work-life balance. Her schedule includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, double gym sessions, and often eating during meetings, eschewing traditional lunch breaks. Guo champions a "996 work culture" (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week), believing most people waste time on distractions like social media. While some critics argue this "always-on" culture is outdated and harms retention, Guo maintains it's necessary for early-stage startup growth, though not for all paths to wealth.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, managing only three hits, which dropped them back into a tie for first place in the National League West. This defeat followed a disappointing week where they squandered a two-game division lead after splitting a series with the Colorado Rockies. Despite a stellar seven-inning performance from pitcher Blake Snell against his former team, the Dodgers' offense struggled against Yu Darvish and the Padres' bullpen. A crucial double play in the eighth inning and a fly ball to the warning track in the ninth sealed their fate, leaving them on the back foot in the division race.</p>
