        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States is uniquely positioned to lead the global artificial intelligence revolution, contingent on leveraging its vast energy resources. The author emphasizes that AI's massive electricity demands require a pragmatic energy policy focused on abundant natural gas, rather than relying solely on less scalable renewables. The article highlights a $500 billion private sector AI investment announced by Donald Trump and suggests that co-locating dedicated, gas-powered generation with data centers will be crucial for maintaining America's economic and national security advantages in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to address contemporary issues. The updated curriculum will include lessons on identifying misogyny, understanding the harm of AI-generated "deepfakes," and recognizing unhealthy attitudes regarding consent. While previous plans for strict age limits on topics have been dropped, the guidance will outline what should be taught in primary versus secondary school, with a new emphasis on proactively engaging parents and teaching pupils to identify positive male role models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dramatic improvement in putting is credited to his work with coach Phil Kenyon, which began in late 2023. Despite being the best player from tee to green, Scheffler was ranked outside the top 150 in putting, but a switch to a mallet putter and refined techniques helped turn his fortunes around. This transformation led to a remarkable season, including a second Masters win and an Olympic gold medal, establishing him as the dominant force in golf as he heads into this week's Open Championship at Royal Portrush.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding analysts' forecasts and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, the growth slowed from the first quarter's 5.4%, and underlying data reveals persistent weakness, including slowing retail sales and a deepening slump in the real estate sector. Despite resilient industrial output, economists point to a sharp decline in the GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices, fueling concerns about deflation and increasing calls for more significant government stimulus and structural reforms.

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans in the U.S. The protections, which were set to expire Monday, shield them from deportation and allow them to work legally. The Department of Homeland Security had moved to end the status, claiming conditions in Afghanistan had improved, a decision challenged by immigrant advocacy group CASA. The court's one-week stay allows for further legal arguments on the matter, providing a brief reprieve for affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025 and making up 40% of all passenger cars in Oslo. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on gasoline and diesel cars. This decisive policy, combined with heavy investment in public charging infrastructure, has effectively transformed the nation's auto market, resulting in cleaner air and quieter cities without significant cost to consumers.</p>

The initiative is part of Meta's push to develop "superintelligence," with the first facility, named Prometheus, expected to be operational in Ohio by 2026. Another planned cluster, Hyperion, could cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, highlighting the immense scale of investment and energy required to power the future of artificial intelligence, which also raises concerns about environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants, potentially revealing a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. A study from Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic "screams" associated with dehydration or stress, suggesting the moths perceive them as unhealthy. This groundbreaking research indicates that many insects and some mammals can hear these plant-based sounds, opening up a new field of study into how this auditory information influences animal behaviors like pollination or foraging.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries often omits many of its highest-paid personalities, creating an incomplete picture of talent earnings. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to stars directly employed by the BBC, not those paid through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Consequently, the earnings of major figures like Claudia Winkleman, Michael McIntyre, and the stars of hit shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" and "The Apprentice" are not publicly listed, a practice the corporation says is necessary to compete in the commercial market.</p>
