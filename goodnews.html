          <p>The Walt Disney Co. and actress Gina Carano have settled her wrongful termination lawsuit, filed after she was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. This article contextualizes the settlement against other corporate legal battles, including one where an anchor wrongly stated Trump was found liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll. The author argues that Carano's firing was an overreaction and that the settlement represents a reasonable conclusion, separate from broader trends of "cancel culture." The piece suggests that Disney's initial decision to fire her, not the settlement itself, was the more problematic action.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only individual to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter to head the FBI in 1978, he was tasked with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal and domestic spying revelations. He later led the CIA under President Ronald Reagan, stepping in after the Iran-Contra affair. Webster was widely respected as a figure of integrity who championed the rule of law throughout his long career in public service, which also included roles as a federal prosecutor and judge.</p>

          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents organizing to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. Volunteers gather daily at locations like a Home Depot in Pasadena to provide information to day laborers and act as observers, aiming to protect vulnerable members of their community. This local-level activism reflects a shift from large downtown protests to smaller, community-based actions in suburban areas. The effort is supported by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which provides training for citizens who wish to document ICE raids and assist immigrant families.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van is celebrating its 60th anniversary, marking six decades as a cultural and commercial staple since its debut on August 9, 1965. Originally a collaboration between Ford's UK and German engineers, its versatility made it a favorite among tradespeople, rock bands like Led Zeppelin, and even, notoriously, bank robbers. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey in 2013, the Transit remains the world's best-selling van, with over 13 million built. As the brand moves toward an electric future, it faces a more competitive market where the brand loyalty it once commanded is no longer guaranteed.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) and are heading for a splashdown off the coast of Southern California. Commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov are concluding their 148-day mission aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Their departure followed a handover ceremony where they transferred command of the station to the newly arrived Crew-11. This mission marks the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific Ocean, a change made by SpaceX to ensure debris from the capsule's trunk section falls safely away from populated areas.</p>

          <p>A surprising political friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a conservative Republican, and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, a prominent Labour Party figure. Despite their vast political differences, the two have bonded over shared experiences, including difficult childhoods and their Christian faith. Vance is currently vacationing in the UK and stayed with Lammy at his official country residence, where the two discussed their relationship with the media. This personal connection is seen by some analysts as potentially valuable for UK-U.S. relations, especially given President Trump's personalized approach to foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Director Antonio Negret's new horror film, "Shaman," delves into themes of demonic possession through an Andean lens, drawing from the culture of a remote region in Ecuador. The movie follows two missionaries whose son appears to be possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual authorities and the Andean demon known as the Supay. Negret, who was born in Colombia and lived in Ecuador, collaborated closely with the local Indigenous community of Pulingui to ensure authentic representation, including the use of the Kichwa language. The film was shot on location at 12,000 feet, using practical effects to create a raw and personal horror experience.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. An investigation by Snopes determined that the claim is unsubstantiated and lacks credibility. Key facts undermine the assertion: Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip, meaning planes could not have landed there, with access being by helicopter or boat. Furthermore, the Facebook user who originated the claim appeared to be wearing a costume pilot pin and was an administrator for anti-Trump online groups, raising questions about the motive behind the post.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has launched an innovative program to combat rising social isolation by opening "warm-hearted convenience stores." These are not retail shops but welcoming, cafe-like spaces where lonely individuals can find community, enjoy free ramen, and access social services. The initiative was prompted by a growing number of "lonely deaths" and a study showing nearly 40% of households in the capital are single-person. The program has been unexpectedly popular, particularly with young people and the elderly, providing a safe space for low-pressure social interaction in a society grappling with the effects of rapid urbanization and changing family structures.</p>

The H20 chip was specifically designed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's technological and military development. The company had previously warned that the restrictions would significantly impact its sales, with China accounting for 12.5% of its revenue in the first quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
