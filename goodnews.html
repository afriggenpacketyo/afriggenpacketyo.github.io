        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a significant outperformance in its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased 22% to $3.72 billion, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion, beating estimates by about $650 million. This strong performance reflects a broader Wall Street trend where market volatility, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, has boosted trading activity across various asset classes. Investment banking fees also saw a robust 26% increase, contributing to the overall positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-China tech relations as the company expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to the country. After a three-month halt due to U.S. export controls, Huang indicated the policy shift was part of a broader governmental exchange, not a result of his direct negotiation. During his visit, he met with Chinese officials and tech leaders, praising local AI development and emphasizing the need to adapt to evolving trade policies. The move comes after U.S. restrictions significantly impacted Nvidia's market share in China.</p>

          <p>Operations at Vancouver International Airport were briefly halted after authorities received a report that a Cessna 172 small aircraft had been hijacked. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated the report indicated the plane was taken from the Vancouver Island area and was entering the airport's airspace with a single suspect occupant. The aircraft landed safely, and the suspect was arrested without incident, leading to a 39-minute grounding of flights. Nine inbound flights were diverted during the disruption, which officials described as an unusual event that was resolved quickly.</p>

          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, beating earnings estimates but missing on revenue expectations. The company's profit saw a modest 3% increase to $7.12 billion, while its revenue of $26.61 billion fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. A key factor was the bank's net interest income (NII), which came in below estimates at $14.82 billion, as lower interest rates offset growth in loans and deposits. Despite the revenue miss, CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted the resilience of consumers and positive momentum in the bank's markets businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's healthcare system has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) be renamed "physician assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, suggests these roles should have standardized uniforms and only see patients with minor ailments after triage by a doctor, to mitigate diagnostic risks. This follows safety concerns and a heated debate over the growing use and responsibilities of PAs in the NHS. The recommendations aim to clarify the purpose of PAs as supportive members of a doctor-led team, rather than substitutes for fully qualified physicians.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a rebound, with Bitcoin and Ether prices rising, fueled by renewed investor optimism that key U.S. legislation could pass this week. Prices had dipped briefly after the House failed to advance the GENUIS Act for stablecoins and the broader CLARITY Act for market structure. However, a statement from President Trump suggesting that reluctant Republicans would now support the legislation revived hopes for a clear regulatory framework. This potential progress is seen as a significant positive for the industry, potentially reducing uncertainty and reinforcing the legitimacy of digital assets like stablecoins.

          <p>The 2025 MLB All-Star Game concluded in a dramatic and unprecedented fashion, with the National League securing a victory over the American League in a home run swing-off. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber of the NL hit three home runs on three swings to clinch the win, earning him the MVP award. This was the first time the new tie-breaking rule, designed to avoid running out of pitchers, has been used. The AL had forced the extra contest after overcoming a six-run deficit, tying the game in the ninth inning before the unique home run derby decided the outcome.</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply to resume direct flights after Pakistan made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which came to light after a fatal Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. This decision follows a similar move by the European Union's aviation safety agency earlier this year. The restoration of these profitable UK routes is expected to boost the value of the struggling state-owned PIA as it moves towards privatization.</p>

During a recent visit to Cairo, Chinese and Egyptian central banks signed agreements to facilitate the use of the yuan in trade and investment between the two nations. The deals include expanding China's UnionPay services and enabling local currency settlements through CIPS, China's alternative to the SWIFT payment network. Egypt is the latest African country, alongside nations like South Africa and Nigeria, to adopt yuan-based financial mechanisms, deepening economic ties with Beijing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont reported a 6% rise in first-quarter sales, slightly ahead of analyst forecasts, though performance was dampened by a notable slowdown in Japan. Sales in Japan fell 15% as a strengthening yen reduced the spending power of tourists, particularly from China, ending a period of currency-fueled growth for the region. The company's overall positive results were driven by its strong Jewellery Maisons division, which includes brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, and saw an 11% sales increase. This performance makes Richemont an outlier in a broader luxury market downturn. (not investment advice)</p>
