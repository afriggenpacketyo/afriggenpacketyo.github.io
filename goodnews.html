          <h2>Consumer Prices Fall in Select Sectors Amidst Overall Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 12:26:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation remains above policymakers' targets, certain areas of the U.S. economy are experiencing price declines, offering consumers some relief. Airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline have all seen prices fall recently due to various factors such as supply and demand dynamics, lower transportation costs, and increased production efficiency. However, economists caution that these lower prices may not last, citing potential reversals in volatile categories and the threat of tariffs. Consumers are advised to enjoy these savings while they can, as the current deflationary trends in these sectors are expected to be temporary.</p>

          <p>After three years of discussions, the UK and India have reached a trade agreement poised to reduce tariffs and enhance trade between the two nations. The deal, hailed as the UK's most significant bilateral trade agreement since Brexit, will lower levies on UK exports such as whisky, gin, aerospace components, and food products, while also cutting taxes on Indian clothing, footwear, and jewelry exports. The agreement also includes provisions for the services sector and procurement, enabling UK firms to compete for more contracts in India. The agreement is expected to increase trade by ¬£25.5 billion a year by 2040.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney announced the Scottish government's programme for government, emphasizing improvements to NHS Scotland, including an additional 100,000 GP appointments, and economic stimulus measures. The plan aims to address challenges in accessing GP appointments and permanently ban peak rail fares, and end an alcohol ban on ScotRail trains. The government will also tackle child poverty and cost-of-living pressures. Critics argue that the proposed measures do not adequately address fundamental issues such as funding shortfalls in healthcare and fail to meet the challenges facing the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates have been steadily declining, but the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting could influence their future direction. While a rate cut is unlikely this week, comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell about potential rate cuts in June or July could cause HELOC rates to shift. Experts advise monitoring the rate climate daily and starting the application process now to take advantage of potentially lower rates. With HELOC rates already more cost-effective than other borrowing options, it may be wise to act sooner rather than later.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere around May 10. Experts predict that the spacecraft, originally intended to land on Venus, could crash in at 150 mph if it remains intact. While the risk of impact is low, the event raises concerns about space debris and its potential to hit populated areas. The spacecraft's heat shield may or may not survive reentry, which would determine the extent of its disintegration during its descent.</p>

          <p>Mexican soccer club Le√≥n has lost its appeal against FIFA, officially excluding them from the Club World Cup due to multi-club ownership issues. Los Angeles FC or Club Am√©rica will likely replace them in the tournament, with a playoff game to determine the replacement. FIFA's new rules prevent two or more teams under the same ownership from participating in the event. The winner of the playoff will receive almost $10 million from the Club World Cup prize money fund.</p>
