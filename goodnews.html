          <p>Following the implementation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, tens of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning to their homes in northern Gaza, particularly in Gaza City and Khan Younis. They are met with widespread destruction, finding entire districts reduced to rubble where their houses once stood. Despite the devastation, many express relief at being able to return after two years of displacement. The UN is preparing to scale up aid deliveries to address severe malnutrition and famine conditions in the region.</p>

          <p>China has issued new guidelines for local governments, warning them not to grant artificial intelligence systems access to sensitive information or state secrets. The document outlines approved uses for AI, such as public consultations, infrastructure monitoring via drones, and assistance with drafting documents to improve efficiency. It also mandates comprehensive safety evaluations before AI models are deployed and requires that government workers receive training on AI technology, safety, and ethics. This initiative is part of a broader effort to streamline government operations and reduce bureaucratic burdens.</p>

Despite losing the bout, which he took on just four days' notice, the opportunity provided him with a significant payday and a multi-fight promotional deal with Matchroom. Padley views the experience as a pivotal moment that successfully launched his career on the world stage. He is now preparing for his next fight in Sheffield as he embarks on a new chapter in the super-featherweight division.</p>

The event, known for its festive atmosphere and large prize purses, attracted other top athletes, including Kenya's Faith Kipyegon, who won the mile.

          <p>Chinese companies are increasing their investment in Africa's pharmaceutical sector, aligning with Beijing's "health silk road" initiative to address the continent's reliance on imported medicines. A new plant to produce Chinese-made insulin is planned for Nigeria, while a major facility in the Ivory Coast will soon manufacture antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. These projects aim to fill critical manufacturing gaps, as Africa currently imports approximately 70 percent of its essential medicines despite bearing a quarter of the world's disease burden. The move is driven by high demand for generic medications and treatments for chronic illnesses.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's Erling Haaland is the clear favorite for the Premier League's Golden Boot award after scoring nine goals in his first seven games, none of which were penalties. Statistical analysis shows that he is not only scoring frequently but is also receiving a significantly higher number and quality of chances compared to his rivals, as measured by expected goals (xG). While his rivals for the European Golden Shoe, Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe, have also started strongly, Haaland's impressive performance from open play positions him as the frontrunner for top scorer.</p>

          <p>German lawmakers are debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as catcalling, which is not currently covered under the country's sexual offenses legislation. The Social Democrats are pushing to close this legal loophole, arguing that such behavior intimidates victims and can constitute a form of violence. While some European countries have already passed similar laws, the proposal faces opposition from coalition partners who question its practicality. Legal experts are also divided, with some suggesting a reinterpretation of existing insult laws could address the issue without new legislation.</p>

In a letter, MIT's president stated the deal would "restrict freedom of expression" and was inconsistent with the university's core values. The proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence" included controversial terms such as capping foreign student admissions, restricting leaders' political comments, and using force to prevent campus protests. Several other prominent universities were also approached with the same offer.</p>

Banayee hopes his story, "Delusions of Paradise," will serve as a warning to young people vulnerable to radicalization.

          <p>As seasons change, many people experience mood shifts, often called the "autumn blues," characterized by tiredness and pessimism. To combat this, some individuals proactively change their routines by increasing social activities, working outside the home, and maximizing exposure to natural light. Experts recommend maintaining a balanced diet, exercising, and spending time outdoors to boost serotonin levels. Other popular strategies include using light therapy boxes, sunrise alarm clocks, and embracing cozy activities to "romanticize" the darker months, which can help reframe one's perspective on the season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump completed what he described as a "semiannual physical" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, six months after his last annual checkup. The White House framed the visit as a routine part of his health maintenance plan ahead of a trip to the Middle East. A summary from his doctor stated the 79-year-old president is in "exceptional health," and claimed his cardiac age was found to be 14 years younger than his actual age. The visit follows recent online speculation about his health, which the White House has sought to dispel.</p>
