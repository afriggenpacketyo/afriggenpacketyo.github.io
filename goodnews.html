          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially become Thailand's new prime minister following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The conservative politician's ascent marks a significant shift, ousting the influential Shinawatra dynasty that has long dominated Thai politics. Anutin secured the position with support from the main opposition, the People's Party, on the condition that he dissolves parliament and calls for new elections within four months. Known for championing the country's cannabis decriminalization, the 58-year-old former health minister has pledged to work with honesty for the nation's benefit.</p>

          <p>Two years after a devastating Achilles injury just four plays into his New York Jets career, quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers against his former team. The highly anticipated 2023 season for the Jets ended in despair after Rodgers' injury, and the team has since undergone a major overhaul with a new coach and quarterback. Now 41, Rodgers' return to MetLife Stadium is framed by a narrative of closure and new beginnings, as both he and new Jets quarterback Justin Fields, formerly of the Steelers, face their old teams in the season opener.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected animal rights extremist accused of two bombings in California in 2003, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. Once the first American-born citizen on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list with a $250,000 bounty, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in Wales. Former FBI agents involved in the original case recall a high-speed chase that ended with his disappearance and the discovery of a suspected bomb-making lab in his abandoned car. The hearing will determine if he is sent back to the U.S. to stand trial.</p>

The iconic 13.1-mile race begins in Newcastle, crosses into Gateshead, and concludes in South Shields, drawing over 200,000 spectators along the route. Event founder Sir Brendan Foster noted the event's growing popularity and changing demographics, with female participation rising from 8% in the first run to 49% last year. Newcastle United players Jacob Murphy and Nick Pope were present to officially start the race, continuing the tradition of celebrity involvement.</p>

          <h2>Total Lunar Eclipse to Create 'Blood Moon' Spectacle Visible in the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 01:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom are set for a celestial treat as a total lunar eclipse will turn the full moon a deep red color, an event commonly known as a 'Blood Moon'. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The reddish hue is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, a process called Rayleigh scattering. While the full eclipse lasts for over an hour, visibility in the UK will be limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans secured a decisive 59-20 victory over Georgia Southern, led by former USC coach Clay Helton. USC's offense was unstoppable, accumulating 755 total yards, the most for the program in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava threw for a career-high 412 yards and four touchdowns before being rested, while the rushing attack added another 309 yards on the ground. The game served as a reunion for Helton, who was fired from USC four years ago, but his team was unable to contain the Trojans' explosive offensive performance, which continued its dominant start to the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has developed a novel method to launch small robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they create a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects up to five feet into the air. This technique offers a new, efficient launching mechanism that could have applications in robotics and micro-propulsion systems.</p>
