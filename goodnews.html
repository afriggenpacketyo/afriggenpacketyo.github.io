          <p>Actress Emma Watson, known for her role in the "Harry Potter" series, recently shared her reasons for stepping back from acting, citing the promotional side of Hollywood as "soul-destroying." While expressing gratitude for her career, she explained that the constant "selling" of projects overshadowed the artistic parts of the job she genuinely enjoyed. Watson noted that this shift away from maintaining a demanding public persona has freed up significant energy, allowing her to be more present in her personal relationships and explore other creative and intellectual pursuits.</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders appeared to confirm that his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, turned down interest from the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles during the 2025 NFL draft before being selected by the Cleveland Browns. Shedeur reportedly did not want to be a long-term backup to established star quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson or Jalen Hurts. Despite being considered a potential first-round pick, he fell to the fifth round. Deion Sanders defended his son's desire for a direct path to playing, stating that players don't develop by sitting on the bench in the NFL.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to ABC on Tuesday, nearly a week after the show was suspended indefinitely. The suspension followed comments the host made linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's MAGA movement, which prompted major affiliate station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to threaten preemption. Disney stated the decision to bring the show back was made after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, who is expected to address the situation on his return. The incident sparked a national debate on free speech and political pressure on media networks.</p>
