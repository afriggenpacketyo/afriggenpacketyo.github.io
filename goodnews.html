          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited India, emphasizing the goal of doubling trade volume between the two nations. He expressed optimism about the potential for an EU-India free trade agreement, highlighting the need to lower trade barriers amidst global protectionist measures. Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar requested Germany's assistance in navigating complex EU trade negotiations, focusing on issues like import duties, climate standards, and farmer protection. The ongoing trade discussions have gained urgency due to altered tariffs imposed by the US on both the EU and India, creating a new impetus for reaching a consensus.

          <p>Phantom energy, or vampire energy, refers to the wasted electricity consumed by devices left plugged in when not in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of home energy consumption. Smart televisions with internet connectivity and wake features can consume significantly more energy in standby mode. Experts recommend unplugging devices when not in use or disabling unnecessary features to reduce energy waste and emissions. Individual actions, like unplugging chargers, can contribute to significant emissions reductions nationally, influencing others to adopt sustainable practices and promote societal norms of responsibility. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased on Wednesday after job openings data came in lower than expected, with the 30-year Treasury bond yield falling more than 6 basis points to 4.909%. Earlier, tariff uncertainty and concerns about Federal Reserve independence briefly pushed the 30-year yield above 5% before it retreated. Investors are also anticipating Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show a slight increase in the unemployment rate and modest job creation for August.

          <p>Claims that cities governed by Democrats experience higher crime rates are not supported by data, according to a fact check. While most large US cities are led by Democratic mayors, this correlation does not imply causation. A study analyzing data from 400 US cities found that the political affiliation of mayors had little impact on crime rates or policing. This article refutes the claim that a mayor's party affiliation influences crime rates. </p>

          <p>Homeowners with significant tappable equity may find home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or home equity loans to be more affordable than other borrowing options. While both offer lower interest rates, HELOC rates are variable and can change based on market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed. Experts suggest that home equity loans may be safer due to predictable payments, while HELOCs suit those who can pay off quicker and handle potential rate hikes.

          <p>A New York judge ruled that DNA evidence will be allowed in the Rex Heuermann Gilgo Beach serial killer case, linking him to the murders of at least seven victims.

Heuermann, arrested in July 2023, has pleaded not guilty to the murders of seven women whose remains were found on Long Island between 1993 and 2011.
