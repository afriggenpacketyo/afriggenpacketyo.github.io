          <p>Amazon has confirmed its plans to acquire Bee AI, a San Francisco-based startup that develops a wearable listening device. Bee's wristband uses artificial intelligence and microphones to analyze conversations, providing users with summaries, reminders, and to-do lists. This acquisition signals Amazon's continued investment in generative AI and its expansion into personal AI-infused hardware, following the sunsetting of its previous Halo fitness wearable. The move places Amazon in direct competition with other tech giants like Meta and OpenAI, which are also developing AI-powered consumer devices to integrate the technology into daily life.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new trade agreements with the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate for goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to the administration, the deals will see the Philippines and Indonesia eliminate tariffs on 99% of U.S. goods, effectively creating an open market for American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. The announcement with the Philippines followed a White House meeting with its president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. These agreements are part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to renegotiate global trade relationships ahead of an August 1st deadline.

          <p>India's women's cricket team clinched a 2-1 series victory over England after winning the decisive third one-day international by 13 runs. Despite a valiant 98 from England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the hosts fell short of the record 319-run target set by India. India's formidable total was anchored by a century from their captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, and supported by a strong bowling performance from 21-year-old seamer Kranti Goud, who took six wickets. The loss leaves England with significant challenges to address ahead of the upcoming World Cup in India later this year.</p>

          <p>During their Euro 2025 semi-final against Italy, England's players and substitutes stood arm-in-arm in a powerful display of solidarity with teammate Jess Carter. The gesture came after Carter revealed she had been subjected to online racist abuse throughout the tournament, which also prompted the team to stop taking the knee before matches. Fans in the stadium also showed their support by singing Carter's name and applauding in the 16th minute, corresponding to her jersey number. The team's actions underscore the ongoing fight against racism in football and a collective desire to find more impactful ways to address it.</p>

Dawson's inclusion is seen as a shift from the experimental pick of the younger Bashir to a more proven and dependable option.

Despite the pressure and floating the idea of firing him, Trump's latest statement suggests a willingness to wait for the term to expire.

          <p>Shares of DuPont saw a positive turn after China's market regulator announced the suspension of an antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations. The probe, which began in April and was widely seen as retaliation for U.S. tariffs, had created a significant overhang on the stock, despite targeting a relatively small part of DuPont's business. Investors were concerned the investigation could derail the upcoming spinoff of its electronics division. With that risk now removed, the stock has rallied to its highest level since March, ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

Negotiations over the final details, particularly concerning add-on payments, have slightly delayed the transfer, but the 27-year-old has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract. Gyokeres has been a high-demand player after a prolific season in which he scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting.
