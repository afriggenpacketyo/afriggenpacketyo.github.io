Project N.O.L.A., a private organization, used its cameras to help recapture one fugitive, despite recent concerns about the technology's legality and potential for misuse. Critics, including the ACLU, argue that live facial recognition poses a threat to fundamental rights and raises constitutional issues.

          <p>"Sister Midnight" is a gritty, stylish comedy about Uma, a restless housewife in Mumbai, who finds strength in her alternative existence. The film captures the city's strange and oppressive atmosphere, teasing out a hidden transformation in Uma. While the movie doesn't fully integrate its episodic nature with its feminist themes, its visual curiosity and Radhika Apte's performance make it a compelling experience. Kandhari's film is a feverish, inventive, and unmanageable work that is set to an Iggy Pop soundtrack.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are departing Paul Weiss after the firm reached an agreement with President Trump to avoid government targeting. The agreement, which involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating funds to mutually agreed-upon causes, sparked controversy in the legal community. The departing attorneys include Dunn, known for representing high-profile clients and her role in Democratic politics, and Jeannie Rhee, who previously worked on the Mueller investigation. It is unclear if the departures are directly related to the firm's deal with Trump.</p>

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a 22-year-old inmate who previously escaped from a Louisiana parish jail, has been recaptured after a second escape. Johnson, awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion, escaped from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail after inmates flooded a cell, and Johnson was lifted over the perimeter fence. This marks his second escape from the same jail, with manpower shortages and inadequate supervision cited as contributing factors in the previous incident. The incident prompted an internal review and administrative leave for several individuals.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a mega-project to construct a 767-kilometer canal linking Jiangxi province, a resource-rich region, to Zhejiang, a wealthy coastal province. This canal is part of a broader initiative to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with coastal hubs. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, expected to cost $44.4 billion, will be capable of accommodating 1,000-tonne vessels and handling approximately 25 million tonnes of cargo annually. It aims to connect Jiangxi's manufacturing hub and abundant rare earth reserves to Zhejiang's seaports.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has called for a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats" following President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on goods from the EU. The EU Trade Commissioner emphasized the importance of mutual respect in EU-US trade relations. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides. This comes as Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations.</p>

The agreement requires Boeing to continue improving its anti-fraud compliance and ethics program. Some families of the crash victims have expressed outrage at the prospect of such a deal.</p>
