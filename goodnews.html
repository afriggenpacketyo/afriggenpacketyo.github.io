          <p>Syria's interim President, Ahmad al-Sharaa, addressed the United Nations General Assembly, marking a significant step in the country's return to the international stage after the ousting of Bashar Assad. While celebrating thawing relations with Western nations, al-Sharaa faces substantial domestic issues, including regional instability, sectarian violence against minorities, and controversy over upcoming elections that critics say lack inclusive representation. He vowed to bring perpetrators of violence to justice and called for the complete lifting of international sanctions to aid Syria's economic recovery. Despite these challenges, a recent poll indicates a growing sense of optimism among Syrians, with a majority believing the country is moving in the right direction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent vote, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, approved a measure to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums, with over 61% in favor. The new rules will completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to the months of October through December to reduce noise and fine dust pollution. Supporters argued the devices are harmful to microorganisms and contribute to air and noise pollution, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents of the ban contended that it represents an unnecessary and anti-social prohibition that will complicate maintenance work for many individuals and businesses in the city.</p>

          <p>The 1960s British band The Zombies are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success. Known for hits like "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season," the group faced financial struggles and a lack of industry interest that led them to break up shortly after releasing their now-iconic album "Odessey and Oracle" in 1968. That album, initially a commercial failure, has since been hailed as a masterpiece and was a key reason for their 2019 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The surviving members reflect on their unusual career path, from teenage stardom to a long, slow journey toward lasting rock immortality.</p>

          <p>China is pioneering an industrial "pull system" designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This new model contrasts with the traditional aerospace "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. The pull system has final assembly lines draw components from suppliers only as they are needed, aiming to lower costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, Chinese researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the future of the space industry.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate. With the national shopping center vacancy rate increasing, landlords are becoming more flexible, offering better rent deals and more favorable lease terms to independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and other service-based businesses. This trend is allowing small business owners to move into spaces that were previously financially out of reach. While the opportunities vary by location, the overall softening of demand is enabling a new mix of tenants to revitalize local retail corridors.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The details of the settlement are confidential. Dominion sued the former Trump lawyer in 2021, citing over 50 instances where he publicly promoted baseless conspiracy theories that the company's voting machines were used to rig the election against Donald Trump. This marks another significant resolution for Dominion, which previously secured a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News and a $67 million settlement from Newsmax for their roles in amplifying the same election lies.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative at the party's annual conference, framing it as a core component of Labour's economic growth strategy and drawing parallels to the post-war government's new town developments. The plan aims to create entire communities with affordable housing, schools, and infrastructure.</p>
