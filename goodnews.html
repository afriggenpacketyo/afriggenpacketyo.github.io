          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed "steady progress" in improving bilateral relations with China during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. This marks a significant diplomatic thaw following years of strained ties, including a deadly border clash in 2020 that froze high-level political engagements. Modi is slated to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, later this month, which will be his first visit to China in seven years. The rebuilding of ties is partly influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, which have increased economic friction between New Delhi and Washington.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration intends to convert previously committed CHIPS Act grants for Intel into an equity stake in the company. This move, which would not grant the government voting or governance rights, aims to ensure the American people receive a financial return on their investment in domestic chip manufacturing. The administration is considering similar equity-for-funding arrangements with other CHIPS recipients, signaling a significant shift in how federal subsidies are structured. This comes as Intel struggles to capitalize on the AI boom and faces scrutiny over its manufacturing expansion plans, with its Ohio factory now scheduled for 2030 completion.

          <p>The stock market is currently undergoing a significant rotation, with investors increasingly moving capital out of high-flying, year-to-date winners and momentum stocks, particularly in the tech and crypto sectors, into more value-themed laggards. This shift is clearly demonstrated by the Invesco S&P 500 equal-weight ETF outperforming the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500, indicating that the average stock is performing better than the largest companies. The article highlights that high-multiple stocks, such as Palantir, are seeing notable declines, underscoring a key investing rule: the importance of consistently locking in gains after parabolic price movements. This market rotation often catches investors off guard and typically lasts for several sessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shenghua Wen, a Chinese national residing illegally in the U.S., has been sentenced to eight years in federal prison for conspiring to illegally smuggle guns, ammunition, and sensitive U.S. technology to North Korea. Wen pleaded guilty to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and acting as an illegal agent for a foreign government. He admitted to receiving approximately $2 million from North Korean officials to procure these items, which he concealed within shipping containers falsely declared as consumer goods bound for China. Federal agents seized a chemical threat identification device and eavesdropping detection equipment from his home, intended for North Korea's military.</p>

          <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that drag shows are protected by the First Amendment, overturning a ban imposed by the president of a public university in Texas. This decision, while legally correct, comes over two years after the ban was initially enacted, highlighting significant judicial delays and their detrimental impact on LGBTQ+ students. The article criticizes the slow legal process and the initial ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, known for his social conservative views. It emphasizes that despite the victory, the prolonged delay caused irreparable injury to students who were denied their constitutional rights during that period.</p>

          <p>Matt and Ross Duffer, the acclaimed creators behind Netflix's hit series "Stranger Things," have inked an exclusive four-year agreement with Paramount Skydance for feature films, television, and streaming projects. This significant deal will commence after their current contract with Netflix concludes in April 2026, at which point their production company, Upside Down Pictures, will begin developing content for Paramount. The brothers expressed immense excitement about this opportunity, particularly their ambition to bring bold, original films to the big screen, calling it the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. They will, however, remain involved with Netflix for ongoing "Stranger Things" franchise projects.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly significantly boosting its iPhone production in India, expanding operations across five factories, including those owned by Tata Group and Foxconn. This strategic move aims to reduce Apple's manufacturing reliance on China, especially in light of recent trade tensions. The expansion coincides with increased pressure from the White House, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has threatened secondary tariffs on India for its continued purchase of sanctioned Russian oil, accusing the country of "profiteering" during the Ukraine war. Despite these geopolitical complexities, Apple's substantial investment in U.S. manufacturing is expected to mitigate the impact of India-related trade penalties.</p>

The film, which was shot over three years and features his wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack, was originally slated to air shortly after his death. The British broadcaster stated its sympathies are with the Osbourne family and confirmed a new air date will be announced "shortly."</p>

          <p>Liverpool's pursuit of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak remains a prominent topic in the summer transfer window, despite an initial £110m bid being rejected. Sources indicate that Liverpool's potential for a follow-up offer, expected to be at least £120m, is contingent upon Newcastle securing two replacement strikers, as the club has publicly maintained Isak is not for sale. Newcastle faces significant challenges in finding suitable replacements, given the high cost of goalscorers and the difficulty of convincing clubs to part with key players late in the window. Isak continues to train separately from the main group, while time is running out for a potential move.</p>

          <p>Following recent high-level discussions involving U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the concept of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine is gaining significant momentum as a potential path to ending the war with Russia. While the Kremlin has reportedly agreed to "Article 5-like protection," concrete details remain scarce. Options under consideration include European nations providing ground troops, though military analysts question the logistical feasibility of such a large deployment. Other possibilities involve leveraging U.S. airpower, intelligence sharing, and consistent military supplies to bolster Ukraine's long-term defense capabilities, aiming for an enduring commitment to its security beyond immediate conflict.</p>

          <p>For individuals holding $150,000 in savings, a high-yield savings account presents a highly compelling option to generate substantial returns while maintaining both safety and liquidity. At a hypothetical Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 4.35%, this significant sum could realistically yield over $6,500 in annual interest, a stark contrast to the minimal earnings from traditional savings accounts. The article underscores that while high-yield rates are variable and subject to Federal Reserve policies, the current elevated rate environment offers a strong opportunity for savers. It advises prompt action to capitalize on these favorable conditions, as delays mean missed potential earnings. (not investment advice)</p>
