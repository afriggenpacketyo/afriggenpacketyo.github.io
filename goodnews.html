          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 01:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are preparing for a spectacular total lunar eclipse this evening, which will transform the full Moon into a striking "Blood Moon" as it passes through Earth's shadow. While the full eclipse occurs between 18:30 and 19:52, visibility in the UK depends on moonrise times, with eastern areas getting the longest view. This celestial event, caused by Earth's position directly between the Sun and Moon, allows sunlight to refract through Earth's atmosphere, casting a reddish hue. It offers a rare chance to witness the mechanics of the solar system, with the next UK-visible eclipse not until 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in collaboration with X-energy, have made a significant breakthrough in developing advanced nuclear fuel, known as TRISO pebbles. These uranium-packed pebbles are touted as the "most robust nuclear fuel on Earth," designed to be safer and more efficient than traditional fuel rods, as they cannot melt in a reactor. This innovation is crucial for powering a new wave of advanced nuclear reactors expected by 2030, aiming to reduce US dependence on foreign high-assay, low-enriched uranium supplies. While challenges like cost and waste storage remain, the potential for stable, low-carbon energy supporting renewables is immense.</p>

          <p>Two fortunate tickets, one sold in Missouri and another in Texas, have successfully claimed the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, which stands as the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. This significant win concludes a period of over three months without a top prize winner, matching the game’s record for the most consecutive drawings. The ticketholders, who will share the immense jackpot, have the option to receive a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million or elect for $893.5 million distributed through 30 increasing annual payments. The odds of securing this jackpot were an extraordinary 1 in 292.2 million, making it a remarkably rare and life-altering event for the individuals involved.</p>

The 66-year-old, known for his 1970s pop success and role in "The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries," largely stepped away from the spotlight to become a television writer and producer. Cassidy reveals that his decades-long hiatus has made his old songs feel fresh, allowing him to perform with a renewed voice. His "The Road to Us Tour" will feature a blend of classic and new music, along with personal stories, as he embraces a return to performing on his own terms.</p>

The final 122.2km stage will be a deeply personal journey through his hometown, commencing at the velodrome named in his honor in Newport, passing his childhood cycling club, and even going within meters of his parents' house. Thomas, currently in 86th position, expressed that finishing his career on home roads will be an "amazing way to finish," describing Saturday's penultimate stage as "emotional" with incredible crowd support. His team, Ineos Grenadiers, will wear a special jersey designed by Thomas himself, celebrating the names, places, and victories that defined his remarkable journey.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn for a town hall, where they condemned oligarchic control and rallied support for progressive policies. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, vowed to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes for the wealthiest, while also criticizing the dismissal of professors for anti-war Palestinian solidarity. Sanders lauded Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" against billionaire donors and media oligarchs, and expressed dismay at mainstream Democratic leaders in New York state for not supporting their party's nominee. The event highlighted a broader fight for the future direction of the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans secured a dominant 59-20 victory over Clay Helton's Georgia Southern team, showcasing a remarkably efficient offense spearheaded by junior quarterback Jayden Maiava. Maiava delivered an impressive performance, throwing four touchdowns and achieving a new career high with 412 passing yards, contributing significantly to USC's formidable 755 total yards—their highest in two decades. While the Trojans' defense conceded several big plays, the sheer offensive firepower ensured a comfortable win, allowing valuable playing time for backup players. Despite the lopsided score, Coach Lincoln Riley maintained that the team is "still a long ways off from our best," yet commended their consistent ability to execute impactful plays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has pioneered an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. This ingenious technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes surrounding water droplets to boil and trigger the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles expand to a critical point, they suddenly collapse, rapidly releasing energy and generating a powerful force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. By meticulously controlling the light flow, scientists can precisely direct how and where these micro-robots launch from a wet surface, and can even enable them to swim, opening new avenues for robotic mobility and demonstrating cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including those in New York, are adopting locked magnetic pouches, like those from Yondr, to enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. Students place their phones in these pouches, which are then locked using magnets at school entrances and unlocked at the end of the day. Educators and parents report that the initiative aims to reduce distractions and foster better classroom engagement, with one principal noting a "positive loud" atmosphere. While some students devise ways to bypass the system, the company and schools hope to create a lasting culture change that encourages students to experience life outside a "fully digital realm."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece highlights that China strategically utilized the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin as a significant diplomatic platform to articulate its vision for a multipolar global order. The summit served to enhance China's geopolitical standing as a reliable and stable alternative in global governance, particularly amidst perceived waning US credibility under former President Donald Trump. A striking image from the event captured Chinese President Xi Jinping engaging in "bonhomie" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a rare display given past tensions. This interaction signals a potential reordering of international alliances and a concerted challenge to the traditionally US-centric framework of global governance.</p>
