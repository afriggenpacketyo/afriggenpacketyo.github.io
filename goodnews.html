          <p>Law enforcement agencies nationwide are intensifying security preparations for Fourth of July celebrations, with the Department of Homeland Security activating its national terrorism advisory system following recent U.S. strikes against Iran. In Fairfax County, Virginia, police are deploying nearly 300 officers, a civil disturbance unit, and aerial assets, leveraging over 20,000 live cameras for real-time monitoring to enhance their ability to react swiftly. Officials emphasize proactive visibility and readiness to ensure public safety amid anticipated large gatherings across the county's numerous parks and waterways. Citizens are encouraged to have a personal safety plan, trusting that local police departments are dedicated to their security and have robust measures in place.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home insurance costs have significantly risen, prompting homeowners to seek ways to reduce expenses without sacrificing essential coverage. Certain renovations can lower premiums by mitigating risks, with insurers favoring upgrades that reduce the chance or size of a loss, though not all improvements qualify. Key projects include full roof replacements, especially with impact-resistant materials, and modernizing old electrical and plumbing systems, as water damage and electrical fires are major claim drivers. Installing monitored alarm systems and storm shutters in hurricane-prone areas also offers substantial discounts. Homeowners should consult their insurance agents before starting projects to ensure eligibility and maximize potential savings.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic delivered a masterclass performance, comprehensively defeating British veteran Dan Evans 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 in their second-round match. Djokovic, 38, showcased an exceptional serving display that left Evans visibly impressed, converting six of his 16 break points and limiting the home favorite to just 16% of his receiving points. This impressive display from the sixth-seeded, 24-time Grand Slam champion reaffirms his formidable form as he aims to equal Roger Federer's record of Wimbledon men's singles titles. He is also trying to finally land a standalone record 25th major, having not claimed one of the sport's most prestigious prizes since the 2023 US Open.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor stock surged 17% after Starboard Value, an activist investor known for pushing corporate changes, revealed it had acquired a more than 9% stake in the online travel company, valued at approximately $160 million. This development follows Tripadvisor's flat performance since the start of the year and a significant plummet of over 30% in 2024. Starboard Value's history includes successful proxy fights and demands for new leadership and cost reductions at major corporations like Autodesk and Pfizer, suggesting potential strategic shifts and increased scrutiny for Tripadvisor.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a newly appointed CDC vaccine panel have raised doubts about the hepatitis B vaccine, questioning its administration to newborns and suggesting a link to autism without evidence. However, infectious disease experts strongly refute these claims, emphasizing there is no evidence the vaccine is unsafe. Universal vaccination for infants, recommended since 1991, has dramatically reduced hepatitis B cases among children, making the virus very rare in those under 19. This success underscores the vaccine's critical role in public health, preventing severe liver infections, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating continued resilience in the labor market despite slowing economic growth. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%, the lowest since February, as payroll gains for April and May were also revised upwards. Job growth was concentrated in government, particularly state and local education, and healthcare sectors, though the federal workforce continued to shed jobs due to efficiency initiatives. Despite these solid figures, warnings persist about potential economic slowdowns from tariffs, with Federal Chair Jerome Powell noting the central bank has held off on lowering interest rates due to President Trump's trade policies.</p>

State and local governments, particularly in education, saw substantial increases of 47,000 and 33,000 jobs respectively, while the federal government continued to shed 7,000 jobs due to ongoing efficiency initiatives under President Donald Trump. Health care and social assistance also contributed significantly, adding over 58,000 positions.

They desire regular, in-person feedback from supervisors.

          <p>As economic conditions shift in mid-2025, seniors are advised to reassess their life insurance policies to ensure they align with current needs and goals, given rising healthcare costs and elevated interest rates. Experts suggest asking if coverage is still necessary, considering evolving obligations like funeral costs and legal fees, which can range from $7,000 to $12,000. It's crucial to evaluate policy types, such as term versus whole life, and ensure beneficiaries match current estate plans, reviewing annually or after major life events. Life insurance can also serve legacy planning for family support or charitable gifts, though tax implications should be confirmed, potentially with an estate planning attorney.</p>

Analysts suggest financial markets are backing the Chancellor, fearing that her departure would weaken fiscal discipline and lead to larger deficits, impacting mortgage rates. Despite the welfare reform reversal creating an almost ¬£5 billion fiscal gap, Reeves reiterated her commitment to fiscal rules, aiming to reassure markets about maintaining financial stability and preventing further market volatility.</p>

          <p>An American author recounts his "odyssey" to legally set off fireworks on a beach in Maine for Fourth of July, discovering the surprising complexities of state and local regulations. While Maine has permissive state laws, many municipalities impose their own restrictions, often limiting use to private property, and banning them year-round in some areas. His quest involved numerous calls to fire departments and the Coast Guard, ultimately revealing the absolute illegality of launching fireworks from a personal watercraft. Despite the legal hurdles and the generic nature of the fireworks, the experience reaffirmed their capacity to elicit delight and celebrate the holiday, leading to an extravagant but brief flurry of detonations.</p>
