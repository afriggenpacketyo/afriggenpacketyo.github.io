          <p>Archaeologists in London have discovered a large collection of painted Roman wall plaster at "The Liberty" development site, offering insights into ancient Londinium. The fragments, discarded during Roman-era demolition before A.D. 200, have been meticulously reassembled by the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). The artworks feature bright yellow and black panel designs adorned with birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres, with influences from other parts of the Roman Empire. The find includes what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain and ancient graffiti, including a complete Greek alphabet. The research into each plaster piece is ongoing, with plans for eventual public display.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates reflects on his father's battle with Alzheimer's and expresses optimism about progress in fighting the disease. He highlights breakthroughs in blood-based diagnostic tests that can detect amyloid plaques in the brain, potentially enabling earlier detection and intervention. Gates also notes the FDA approval of two drugs, Lecanemab and Donanemab, which modestly slow the disease's progression, with increased funding for research being crucial. Gates emphasizes that early diagnosis paired with new treatments offers hope, marking a shift from when Alzheimer's was considered a "death sentence."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are being sold for a record $10 billion to an investment group led by Mark Walter, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, indicating a shift in sports ownership. The sale highlights how sports teams have become too valuable for individual billionaires or families to solely control. The Buss family, who owned the Lakers since 1979, sold a majority stake to Walter's group, reflecting a trend where institutional investors are increasingly involved in sports team ownership. This transition raises questions about accountability and potential exploitation of teams, though the Lakers' strong market position suggests continued success.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the dominant theory that birds sing at dawn due to favorable acoustic transmission conditions. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found no evidence supporting the idea that sound travels farther or more clearly at dawn. The study suggests that the dawn chorus is more related to birds marking territory after nighttime inactivity and communicating about food resources. While the study does not definitively explain the dawn chorus, it rules out environmental factors as the primary cause, highlighting the complexity of bird vocal behavior.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly regarding rare earth minerals, long before China's recent export restrictions. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan has diversified its rare earth sources, investing heavily in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90%. While Japan is better prepared than most countries, it still faces challenges in cutting dependency, especially for heavy rare earth elements, highlighting the ongoing complexities of escaping China's mineral dominance.</p>
