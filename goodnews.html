          <p>Canada announced it will remove a significant portion of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, although duties on autos, steel, and aluminum will persist for now. This move, effective September 1, follows a phone call between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions that arose from the U.S. imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Carney emphasized Canada's commitment to preserving its unique trade advantage within the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. The White House welcomed the development as "long overdue," indicating a readiness to continue discussions on trade and national security matters ahead of the USMCA review.</p>

          <p>Florida State Senator Joe Gruters, a prominent ally of President Trump, has been unanimously elected as the new chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Gruters, who previously led the Florida Republican Party, outlined his mission to expand the GOP's grassroots operations and secure victories in the upcoming midterm and presidential elections. His elevation highlights the increasing influence of Florida Republicans within the national party and the current administration. Despite the RNC's robust financial standing, the party confronts significant challenges heading into the 2026 midterms, particularly given the perceived unpopularity of some of Trump's signature domestic policy initiatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a dovish speech at Jackson Hole, indicating that economic conditions, including a slowing labor market and the one-time impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation, may warrant adjusting the policy stance. This has significantly increased market expectations for interest rate cuts, with the probability of a September cut rising to 91%. In response, the stock market rallied, particularly benefiting cyclical sectors like consumer discretionary, real estate, industrials, and materials. Investors are now focusing on companies whose earnings estimates are likely to be revised upwards due to lower borrowing costs and increased economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Welsh Fire secured their inaugural victory of The Hundred season, eliminating Birmingham Phoenix from knockout stage contention with a 36-run triumph at Edgbaston. Sophia Dunkley's 53 runs and a dynamic 44 from Jess Jonassen, including four sixes, anchored Fire's season-high total of 150-3. Despite a resilient half-century from Phoenix captain Ellyse Perry, their chase faltered due to early wickets from Shabnim Ismail and a lack of sustained partnerships. This result marks a significant win for the already-eliminated Fire, highlighting strong individual performances and a challenging end to Phoenix's campaign.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain a secure and reliable investment option for savers, offering guaranteed returns and FDIC insurance, particularly with current rates hovering around 4%. A $10,000 deposit can accrue substantial interest over various terms, with examples illustrating earnings from roughly $107.50 for a 3-month CD to approximately $2,100 over five years. The article stresses the importance of aligning CD terms with individual liquidity requirements, as longer commitments typically yield higher returns but limit early access.

          <p>Divers have successfully retrieved numerous 2,000-year-old artifacts, including ancient statues and Roman coins, from a sunken city located in Abu Qir Bay off Egypt's Mediterranean coast. This site is believed to be an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a prominent hub during both the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Roman Empire, which eventually succumbed to earthquakes and rising sea levels. Among the significant discoveries are statues of royal figures, sphinxes, and remnants of a merchant ship, providing invaluable insights into historical life. This remarkable archaeological find also serves as a poignant reminder of modern Alexandria's increasing vulnerability to rising sea levels due to climate change.</p>

          <p>The summer box office successfully surpassed 2024 figures, achieving an estimated $3.75 billion, primarily propelled by popular films such as "Lilo & Stitch" and "Superman." However, this total remains below the pre-pandemic benchmark of $4 billion, partly attributed to production disruptions caused by previous writers' and actors' strikes. Despite positive audience turnout, industry analysts foresee a notable cooldown in ticket sales throughout August, September, and October. A significant resurgence is not anticipated until late November, with highly awaited releases like "Wicked: For Good" and "Zootopia 2," underscoring a period of fluctuating performance for the theatrical industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent signals about potential interest rate cuts could offer a significant opportunity for homeowners considering mortgage refinancing. Experts indicate that a reduction in the Fed's benchmark rate would likely lead to lower mortgage rates, which typically track 10-year Treasury yields, thereby providing more favorable borrowing terms. Homeowners with existing higher-rate mortgages are encouraged to actively monitor rate fluctuations, review their credit reports, and prepare essential documents to capitalize on potential refinancing opportunities. Swift action is advised when rates decline enough to ensure substantial savings in this dynamic market. (not investment advice)</p>
