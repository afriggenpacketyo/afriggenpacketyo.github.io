          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and television host Matt Tebbutt will replace Gregg Wallace as a judge on the upcoming series of 'MasterChef: The Professionals.' He will join established judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. Tebbutt's appointment follows Wallace's dismissal in July after an independent inquiry upheld 45 allegations of misconduct against him, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. The report also substantiated a claim of offensive language used by fellow host John Torode, leading to his dismissal as well, leaving the future of the main series' judging panel unannounced.</p>

          <p>A top Chinese space researcher has revealed that the country is planning a mission to test its capabilities in defending Earth from potential asteroid threats. Wu Weiren, chief designer of China’s lunar exploration program, stated that the mission aims to demonstrate a "kinetic impact" technique. The plan involves launching two spacecraft, an impactor and an observer, towards a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. The goal is to achieve a minor orbital deflection of 3 to 5 centimeters, providing crucial data for future planetary defense strategies and technologies.</p>

          <p>As the filmed version of the musical 'Hamilton' arrives in movie theaters for the first time, ten years after its Broadway debut, its cultural resonance is being re-evaluated. Initially hailed as a groundbreaking, progressive work closely aligned with the optimism of the Obama era, the show's legacy is now viewed through the lens of a more polarized America. The article explores how the musical's themes of revolution, immigration, and nation-building feel different in the context of the Trump administration. While once a unifying cultural phenomenon, critiques have emerged regarding its portrayal of the founding fathers and its optimistic view of the American experiment.</p>

          <p>The US Open women's final will feature world number one Aryna Sabalenka against American Amanda Anisimova, setting the stage for a compelling match centered on redemption. Sabalenka, the defending champion, is seeking to overcome defeats in this year's Australian and French Open finals. Anisimova is looking to rebound from a crushing 6-0, 6-0 loss in her first major final at Wimbledon just two months ago. The final represents a significant mental test for both players, who are known for their powerful, aggressive styles and have split their two previous meetings this year, including Anisimova's upset victory at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, the celebrated all-Black 369th Infantry Regiment from World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor. The recognition comes over a century after their distinguished service, during which they fought alongside French forces for 191 days due to segregation in the U.S. military. The ceremony acknowledged the soldiers' bravery in the face of intense discrimination both at home and on the battlefield. The medal will be housed at the Smithsonian Institution, honoring a legacy that for decades was largely overlooked in American history.</p>

          <h2>Rise of Weight-Loss Drugs Sparks Shift in Consumer Grocery Spending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is beginning to impact the snack food industry and overall grocery shopping habits. Recent research indicates that new users of these drugs reduce their grocery spending by 6% within six months and tend to swap ultra-processed snacks for healthier options. This measurable shift is prompting retailers to adapt, with some reformulating ready-made meals to have higher protein and vegetable content. While the drugs reduce overall calorie consumption, some evidence suggests users still crave snack foods, just in smaller quantities, setting up a new dynamic between public health trends and food companies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual move for the U.S. government, the Trump administration has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. The decision converts billions of dollars in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, aiming to bolster domestic manufacturing of cutting-edge microchips. This strategic investment is motivated by geopolitical competition with China and the race for artificial intelligence dominance, seeking to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC. While the deal does not grant the government voting rights, it marks a significant federal intervention into a private company outside of a major economic crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Hisahito, the nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. At 19, he is now second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne and is widely expected to become emperor one day. The event casts a renewed spotlight on Japan's strict male-only succession law, as Hisahito and his father are the only two remaining male heirs. This shortage has fueled a long-standing debate over whether the law should be changed to allow a female, such as Emperor Naruhito's daughter Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has started its World Cup qualification campaign with a valuable point, securing a draw against a strong Danish team in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his players' work-rate and endeavor in a performance built on grit rather than flair. The result is seen as a positive and psychologically important start, immediately putting one of the group's main rivals on the back foot. Several key Scottish players, including Grant Hanley and Aaron Hickey, delivered impressive performances despite having limited club game time this season, offering reasons for cautious optimism for the remainder of the campaign.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita performed one of football's most audacious and memorable saves, the "scorpion kick," during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. The article recounts the legendary moment when Higuita, instead of catching a miscued shot, dove forward and cleared the ball with his heels over his back. This iconic save defined the career of a player already known as 'El Loco' (The Madman) for his flamboyant style, which included dribbling far from his goal and scoring 43 career goals. The piece also touches on his complex legacy, including his time in prison and his role as a pioneer of the modern sweeper-keeper.</p>
