          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 to 2025 due to an issue where door trim pieces may detach while driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warned that these detached parts could create a road hazard, increasing the risk of a crash for other vehicles. The company, which is unaware of any related accidents or injuries, stated the problem stems from a vehicle assembly issue rather than a parts defect, and dealers will perform inspections and replacements at no cost to owners.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino asserts that despite public perception, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events, citing an average price of $72. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the soaring post-pandemic demand for live events and noted that touring has become the primary revenue source for artists, with some tours resembling a "Super Bowl" production every night. He also mentioned that technological advancements, such as AI-driven ticketing, could improve the purchasing experience for consumers in the future.</p>

          <p>The startup Tensor is developing what it calls the world's first "personal robocar," a luxury electric vehicle designed for consumer ownership with Level 4 autonomy. The vehicle aims to allow drivers to take their eyes off the road, featuring a steering wheel that can fold away to create a mobile lounge or office space. Packed with numerous sensors like cameras, lidars, and radars, the car's AI is designed to mimic human driving decisions without constant cloud support, enhancing privacy. The company plans to begin selling the vehicle, manufactured in partnership with VinFast, by 2026.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's Waymo is partnering with Lyft to introduce its autonomous ride-hailing service to Nashville, Tennessee, next year, causing Lyft's stock to climb over 10%. Under the agreement, Lyft will manage the fleet's operations, including vehicle maintenance and depot management. While riders will initially book through the Waymo app, the robotaxis will eventually be integrated into the Lyft platform. This marks Waymo's first commercial deal with Lyft and expands its significant presence in the U.S. robotaxi market, where it competes with services from Tesla and Amazon's Zoox.</p>

          <p>World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has offered a positive perspective on the global trade disruptions caused by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Speaking at a WTO forum, she framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of “reglobalization.” While acknowledging the trading system has been heavily disrupted, she pushed back against claims of the WTO's irrelevance, noting that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. She argued this period presents a chance for the global community to innovate its approach to trade.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle has publicly pushed back against United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's recent declaration that the ultra-low-cost airline model is dead. Kirby had predicted that major discounter Spirit Airlines would fail, a comment Biffle dismissed as "cute," attributing the industry's struggles to flight oversupply. The dispute highlights the intense pressure on budget carriers, which are facing increased costs, fare competition from larger airlines' basic economy offerings, and an over-saturated domestic market. Biffle defended his airline's lower costs and its focus on value-conscious customers.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing unusually humid and stormy weather this week, with conditions more typical of Florida, due to moisture from Tropical Storm Mario in the Pacific. Forecasters predict the weather pattern will bring a threat of thunderstorms, which could lead to dry-lightning fires or flash floods and debris flows. While most of the Los Angeles and Ventura county areas are expected to receive about half an inch of rain, some mountain regions could see up to an inch or more. The increased humidity is expected to make conditions feel warm, muggy, and uncomfortable across the region for several days.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, savers may want to consider opening a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in currently available high rates. With rates on savings products expected to continue their gradual decline, a CD offers a fixed return that protects against future cuts. Experts note that even with the recent reduction, savers can still earn significant guaranteed interest over several years with a long-term CD. This strategy provides stability and a predictable return in an unpredictable economic climate where other investment returns may fluctuate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate will have a mixed but tangible impact on household finances. Consumers with variable-rate debt, such as credit cards, will likely see their interest rates decrease almost immediately, providing some relief from high borrowing costs. However, rates on high-yield savings accounts and CDs are expected to fall, reducing returns for savers. While the cut has already been factored into current mortgage rates, a series of future cuts could lead to a gradual decline in the cost of new home and auto loans over the coming months.

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a significant amount of alcohol through their diet of ripe, fermented fruit. Scientists measured the ethanol content in fruits eaten by the chimps and calculated that their daily intake is equivalent to about 14 grams of ethanol, or nearly two alcoholic beverages for a human. This study provides the first direct chemical evidence of ethanol consumption in wild chimps' diets. The findings lend support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' fruit-eating habits.</p>
