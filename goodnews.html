          <p>Aaron Rodgers is reportedly ending his time in the wilderness by signing a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to multiple sources. The 41-year-old quarterback parted ways with the New York Jets earlier this year and has been linked to the Steelers, who lack an established starter. Rodgers's hesitation over signing a contract had irritated many around the Steelers, but he is now set to join the team. If Rodgers does end up as the Steelers' starter he will face a familiar foe in Week 1: Pittsburgh are scheduled to play the Jets in their season opener.</p>

          <p>A California court has ruled that holding a cellphone while driving for navigation purposes is illegal, even if the driver is not actively using the phone. The court stated that looking at a map on the screen while holding the phone violates the state law prohibiting drivers from texting or talking on a cellphone while driving. The decision aims to reduce distracted driving and encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road. Mounted phones are exempted from the ruling, but holding the phone for navigation is now considered a violation of the law.</p>
