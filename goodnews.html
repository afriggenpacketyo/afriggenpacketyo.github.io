          <p>Kyodo News reports that Japan is allocating 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses amid inflation, while also protesting China's maritime research in its exclusive economic zone. Additionally, Japan is urging domestic universities to accept students affected by the U.S. ban on foreign students from Harvard University. The government is also addressing concerns over rising rice prices by releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, and investigating explosions at a Tokyo construction site that resulted in minor injuries and damaged buildings. These actions highlight Japan's efforts to manage economic challenges and maintain international relations.</p>

          <p>Politicians are pushing to boost manufacturing in the U.S., but is this sector truly special? While some argue it's about nostalgia, others point to the manufacturing premium: higher wages, especially for non-college-educated workers, as detailed in a recent study. This research tracks workers moving between industries to isolate the causal effect of working in manufacturing, revealing a significant pay bump compared to sectors like retail and healthcare. High-end manufacturing, involving expensive machinery, offers the highest premium, while factors like unionization and the need for skilled labor contribute to these higher wages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world‚Äôs largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in emissions even as energy demand increased, largely due to aggressive clean energy deployment. A Carbon Brief report indicates a 1% drop in overall greenhouse gas emissions, with increased wind, solar, and nuclear power outpacing electricity demand growth. This shift puts China ahead of schedule for its climate targets and marks a significant step toward meeting international climate goals. China's role as a major producer of clean energy technologies also benefits the global market, although concerns remain about emissions from other greenhouse gases and the potential for increased fossil fuel use.</p>

While hormone therapy exists to manage menopausal symptoms, newer approaches focus on slowing ovarian aging through methods like ovarian tissue cryopreservation and medications like rapamycin. Concerns arise about the potential risks of prolonged estrogen exposure and the ethical implications of treating aging as a condition to be cured, prompting discussions about balancing medical benefits with societal pressures on women to remain young and fertile.</p>
