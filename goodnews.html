The new government's efforts have been aided by the United States' decision to lift most sanctions, which is intended to encourage financial recovery. However, progress is being significantly hampered by a severe lack of liquidity within the country. This financial shortfall poses a major obstacle to stabilizing the nation and establishing a functional economy for its citizens.</p>

The show featured Kelce attempting to find a girlfriend from a pool of 50 contestants, one from each state. Johnson also commented on Kelce's current relationship with Taylor Swift, calling them a "power couple."</p>

          <h2>Experts Argue for Debt Forgiveness Despite Steady Inflation Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 16:32:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Even with the annual inflation rate holding steady at 2.7%, financial experts suggest that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a sensible strategy for many Americans. The primary reason is that credit card interest rates are still near historic highs, with average rates around 22%. This creates a massive gap between the rate at which debt grows and the rate at which money loses purchasing power to inflation. Given ongoing economic uncertainties, such as the potential impact of tariffs, addressing high-interest debt now can provide crucial financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a significant rally, with the S&P 500 rising 1.1% and approaching its all-time high. The surge was fueled by a new government report showing that consumer inflation in July was slightly better than economists had anticipated, holding steady at a 2.7% annual rate. This data increased investor hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the justification it needs to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially providing a boost to the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Detroit has awarded nearly $60 million to a man who sued a former Michigan prosecutor and a state police officer for violating his rights. The plaintiff, Sean MacMaster, was wrongfully charged with sexual abuse in 2019 in a case that was later dismissed by the state attorney general. The jury found that the prosecutor, Brian Kolodziej, pursued the charges with "malice or in reckless disregard" for the truth, allegedly to impress a relative of MacMaster's ex-wife. The award includes $33 million for damages and $25 million in punitive damages.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are projecting that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This estimated increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment provided in 2025. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on inflation data from July, August, and September and is announced in October. The projection reflects the current inflationary environment and its direct impact on the financial benefits that millions of retirees and other beneficiaries depend on. (not investment advice)</p>
