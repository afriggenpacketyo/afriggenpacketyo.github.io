Despite remaining weak and undergoing medical treatment, Edan is happy to be home with his family, sharing details of his captivity at his own pace.

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Japan, was arrested after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on an expressway and colliding with multiple vehicles. The incident occurred on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, resulting in minor injuries to four women. The man is accused of failing to report the accident and may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway, continuing to drive in the wrong direction for approximately 10 kilometers after the initial collisions.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's potential to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly becoming the largest global listing in 2025, with funds primarily allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. CATL's expansion into Europe coincides with similar moves by other Chinese EV makers, amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU regarding trade practices. The company's future success hinges on navigating geopolitical tensions and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the European market.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to face Tottenham in the Europa League final, a match with significant financial implications for the club. Failure to win would mean no Champions League qualification, potentially costing the club over ¬£100m in revenue from tickets, broadcast money, and sponsor bonuses. The club's debt burden, largely due to the Glazer family's leveraged takeover, adds further pressure, as they are at risk of failing to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. Winning the Europa League would provide a much-needed financial boost and secure a spot in the lucrative Champions League, making this match a defining moment for the club.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration considered acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, aiming for a quicker solution than the delayed Boeing contract for new jets. The plan involved weeks of secret coordination, with Trump's Middle East envoy playing a key role, eventually leading to Qatar offering the plane as a gift. Ethical concerns have been raised about the propriety of accepting such a gift, while practical challenges remain regarding the costs and time required to refit the plane for presidential use. Despite the uncertainties, Trump expressed enthusiasm for the plane, potentially reshaping the future of presidential air travel.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand government has deferred a vote on the rare suspension of three Indigenous lawmakers from parliament for performing a haka during the reading of a contentious bill. The parliamentary privileges committee recommended the suspensions due to concerns that the haka could be seen as intimidating. The vote has been delayed to allow the suspended members to participate in the federal budget, with the opposition calling for a compromise and proposing censure instead of suspension. The incident has sparked debate over parliamentary rules and the appropriateness of the proposed sanctions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners, however, the deals have required politically sensitive concessions. While these agreements offer benefits such as streamlined travel for British citizens and reduced tariffs on luxury cars, they also highlight Britain's diminished economic position post-Brexit. The deals will generate nearly 9 billion pounds a year by 2040, adding just 0.2 percent to Britain's GDP, with Brexit costing the country 5.5 percent of its GDP. Starmer's government is attempting to balance trade interests amidst complex global dynamics.</p>
