          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in Central London, revealing details of a luxurious Roman villa. The frescoes, depicting musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offer insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The art provides clues about the artists, with one fragment bearing the Latin word "Fecit," meaning "has made this." This discovery highlights the city's rich Roman history and the sophistication of its early inhabitants. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering" to reclassify their products and incur lower duty rates. This legal practice involves altering an item's materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into a different harmonized system code. Companies in sectors like garments and footwear are finding it relatively easy to implement these changes. For example, Columbia Sportswear adds small zippered pockets to women's shirts to qualify for lower duties, while Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to be categorized as slippers.
