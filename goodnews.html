          <p>This article reports on the subdued box office performance in China during the Dragon Boat Festival, despite a Hollywood film leading ticket presales. The box office revenue for the first day of the holiday was lower than that of the previous public holiday, indicating a struggle to stimulate domestic consumption. The film *Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning* topped the charts, outperforming domestic animated features, even with previous import restrictions on American films. The article notes that China's film market remains resilient in the long term, driven by improvements in domestic productions, despite a decline in revenue last year.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, leading to a public safety alert. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and maintain a safe distance due to the risk of bee stings, particularly for those with allergies. Beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate their queen, with the road closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the rescue efforts. The initial estimate of 250 million bees was later corrected, and authorities expressed gratitude to those who helped with the challenging situation.</p>

Senior pitcher Addison Moorman led the team, striking out 11 batters and limiting Carson to just four hits.
