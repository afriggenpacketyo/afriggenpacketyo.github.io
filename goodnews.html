          <p>The first direct air shipment of Cambodian durians has arrived in China, establishing a new four-hour cold chain logistics corridor for fresh fruit between the two nations. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit approved for direct import into the Chinese market, a move that signifies deepening agricultural trade ties. While Cambodia's annual durian output exceeds 120,000 tonnes, some industry insiders express caution regarding the fruit's commercial competitiveness against established suppliers. This development is part of what some observers call China's "durian diplomacy."</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation, Mexico has transferred 26 prominent cartel figures to U.S. custody to face charges for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. The extradited individuals include leaders from groups like "Los Cuinis," an affiliate of the CJNG cartel, and figures tied to the Sinaloa Cartel. This move follows a similar transfer in February and is part of a deal where the U.S. agreed not to seek the death penalty. The action underscores increased collaboration on security between the Trump and Sheinbaum administrations amid ongoing pressure to curb drug smuggling.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury has acquitted Karen Read of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, though she was convicted of driving under the influence. The verdict concludes a highly publicized retrial that captivated the public with its complex and contentious details. The defense successfully argued that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, countering the prosecution's claim that she intentionally struck O'Keefe with her vehicle and left him to die in a snowstorm.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly frozen. The judge ruled the suspension of over a third of the $584 million in frozen funds violated a previous court order blocking such terminations. The administration had cited alleged discrimination and antisemitism at the university as justification for the freeze, which affected research in fields like cancer and clean energy. This ruling is the first major legal test of the grant suspensions, though it does not affect funds from other agencies like the NIH.</p>

This was the Vulcan's first "certified" mission, clearing it to carry high-value national security payloads.

Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on qualifying loans for purchases like cars and education. This policy is part of Beijing's broader strategy to unlock consumer spending potential and shore up the economy. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy, with provincial governments covering the remainder. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes $34.5 Billion Unsolicited Bid for Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise, unsolicited offer of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The bid comes as Google faces a potential court order to divest Chrome following a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling that found the company holds an illegal monopoly in internet search. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, argues that moving Chrome to an independent operator would benefit the public. However, industry analysts have called the offer a "stunt," noting the bid is likely far below Chrome's true value.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the car and motorcycle driving theory test starting in early 2026. The goal is to better equip the 2.4 million people who take the test each year with life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at an emergency scene. Learning materials have been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public defibrillator. Evidence suggests immediate CPR can increase cardiac arrest survival rates from under 10% to as high as 70%.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey is now able to learn in person from veteran Keenan Allen, a player he studied on film before Allen's recent return to the team. McConkey, who broke some of Allen's rookie records, is taking every opportunity to learn from one of the league's premier route runners. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman praised Allen's presence, noting it adds flexibility and strength to the offense. The two receivers are expected to be versatile assets, capable of playing multiple positions within the team's offensive schemes.</p>

After a complex repair process, the water is now deemed safe to drink. The DWP is urging residents to thoroughly flush their pipes and appliances and has announced a $20 credit for affected customers.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" against Cameroon during the West African nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for actions that continued even after Cameroon's independence in 1960. This admission follows a 2022 historical report which found that French forces were responsible for mass displacements, internment camps, and supporting brutal militias, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths. The move is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets surged on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq approaching record highs, following a report that consumer inflation was slightly lower than anticipated. The data showed that July's inflation rate held steady at 2.7%, below economists' forecasts, fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the justification to cut interest rates in September. Traders increased their bets on a rate cut, which would lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. The positive market movement also came after President Trump delayed some tariffs against China. (not investment advice)</p>
