        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Hurricane Humberto strengthens in the Atlantic, there is a possibility it could interact with a nearby developing storm system, potentially creating a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging or altering each other's paths. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely due to the second system's relative weakness, it remains a scientific possibility. The interaction could slightly change the forecast tracks of both storms as they move through the western Atlantic region.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell has shared her vision for the upcoming film adaptation of "Wuthering Heights," stating she wants to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading the novel as a teenager. Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, Fennell described her connection to the book as profound and singular. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, has already generated buzz with an erotically charged trailer. Fennell, known for "Saltburn," aims to create an emotional and visceral experience that honors the book's complex and devastating nature.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that the company's voting machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell's claims about Smartmatic's role in Los Angeles County were demonstrably false. However, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a standard Smartmatic must still prove to be awarded damages. Smartmatic's attorney stated they will seek "nine-figure damages" for the harm caused by the baseless allegations.</p>

Despite a decisive loss for his foursomes pairing of Collin Morikawa and Harris English, Bradley has decided to send them out again on Saturday against the same European opponents. Bradley defended his decision, stating the team will "stick to our plan" and not panic, emphasizing that the players were eager for a chance at redemption. The U.S. team struggled on the greens, and the captain stressed the need to adopt a different mindset while playing from behind.</p>

          <p>Researchers have reported a major breakthrough in the treatment of Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with no current cure. A new gene therapy has been shown to slow the disease's progress by 75% in a clinical trial, offering unprecedented hope to patients and their families. The treatment involves a complex brain surgery to deliver the therapy. While the full study results are yet to be published and regulatory approval is still years away, the news has been met with emotional relief within the Huntington's community, which has long awaited any effective treatment for the devastating condition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning philosophy long championed by King Charles is reportedly inspiring the design of a new generation of towns in England. Government officials have outlined plans for 12 new towns that will prioritize walkability, "gentle density" like terraced housing over high-rises, and environmental sustainability. These principles align closely with the King's advocacy for traditional architecture and community-focused design, as seen in his projects like Poundbury. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's views on creating humane and harmonious living spaces are now being integrated into mainstream government planning for future housing developments.</p>

          <p>A BBC Radio 4 experiment followed three individuals with no social media presence as they attempted to become influencers over three months. The participants—a potter and stroke survivor, a historian specializing in beards, and a theatre performer—navigated the challenges of building an online audience. Their journeys revealed the emotional toll of chasing views, the burden of engaging with comments, and the struggle to maintain authenticity. While some found that social media could amplify their professional work, the experiment highlighted the immense time, effort, and mental resilience required to achieve even modest online traction.</p>

          <p>An Ohio high school is providing a unique space for teenage boys to openly discuss their struggles and the complexities of modern masculinity through a program called "Men's Work." Led by a teacher and the founder of the organization Hey Brother, the sessions aim to counteract harmful online messaging from the "manosphere." The program addresses the pressure boys feel to be physically strong and their reluctance to discuss mental health. By fostering open dialogue, the initiative helps young men navigate their emotions and challenge restrictive stereotypes in a supportive, non-judgmental environment.</p>

          <p>During a Philadelphia Phillies game, 9-year-old Jameson Pennings performed a remarkable act of kindness that has since captured hearts. After catching a coveted foul ball, Jameson noticed another fan, Donna Morey, who was celebrating her 80th birthday at the game. Realizing she was unlikely to get a ball herself, he walked over and gave his to her. Jameson explained that he felt she deserved it more since she may not attend many more games, whereas he has more opportunities. The selfless gesture symbolized "goodness in this world" for Morey and left Jameson feeling even happier than if he had kept the ball.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. Earhart and her navigator vanished over the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe, sparking decades of fascination and numerous theories. While it is widely believed she crashed after running out of fuel, some theories suggest she was on a spy mission and was captured by the Japanese on the island of Saipan. It is unclear what classified information the government holds, but the move aims to bring transparency to one of history's most enduring mysteries.</p>

          <p>Southern California has experienced a dramatic display of weather, with at least 2,000 lightning strikes recorded over the past 48 hours. The electrical storm, concentrated mostly over the Pacific Ocean, was caused by a slow-moving low-pressure system. This activity precedes a forecast for more wet weather over the weekend, with a weak system expected to bring isolated showers and thunderstorms to the region. While rainfall amounts are expected to be light for most areas, there is a potential for heavier downpours over recent burn scars, raising concerns about possible mudslides.</p>
