          <p>The Food and Drug Administration plans to implement artificial intelligence in its drug approval processes to significantly increase efficiency, particularly in light of a Trump-driven reduction of nearly 2,000 employees. Agency officials view AI as a crucial tool to expedite the delivery of drugs to the market. This move reflects a broader trend of leveraging technology to streamline operations and maintain productivity amidst resource constraints. The FDA hopes that AI can help them maintain the quality of their work while still managing the demands of the industry. The adoption of AI is expected to lead to faster approvals and more efficient resource allocation. The future of the FDA's drug approval process could become more efficient and effective. </p>

          <p>Despite market volatility during President Trump's second term, investors' portfolio balances remain relatively stable, with the S&P 500 showing a positive annualized return of 1.58%. The market experienced several significant drops, but experts advise investors to remain calm during turbulent times, emphasizing that volatility does not predict direction. Other presidential terms, like those of Joe Biden and Barack Obama, saw larger returns in their early months, but Trump's second term outperformed George W. Bush's initial period. Investors are generally encouraged to maintain their market positions over the long term, navigating through different presidencies and economic cycles. Despite the market swings, long-term investment strategies have historically yielded positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison between a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) and a $10,000 high-yield savings account shows that CDs currently offer slightly higher interest rates, with the added benefit of a fixed rate for the term. While high-yield savings accounts offer variable rates, short-term CDs provide guaranteed returns, making them attractive for savers seeking stability. However, high-yield savings accounts offer more flexibility, allowing access to funds without early withdrawal penalties. The decision depends on individual priorities, balancing the desire for higher guaranteed returns with the need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally written to UEFA to express concerns over Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League, citing potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules. The issue centers on John Textor, who owns a 43% stake in Crystal Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, both of whom have qualified for the competition. UEFA rules prevent any individual or entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament. If UEFA rules against Palace and Lyon, Lyon would get priority, potentially opening a Europa League spot for Forest. UEFA regulations aim to prevent collusion between clubs. </p>

Christianity also grew but declined as a proportion of the global population. The religiously unaffiliated are now the third-largest group, particularly in Europe and North America, where many people raised Christian no longer identify with any religion.
