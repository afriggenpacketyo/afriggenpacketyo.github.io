          <p>New German leader Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss critical issues including the war in Ukraine and trade tensions. Merz, who assumed leadership of Germany on May 6, has been actively involved in diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and maintain Western support for Ukraine. Germany also seeks to de-escalate trade disputes between the European Union and the United States, particularly after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU. This will be the first in-person meeting between the two leaders. The meeting underscores the importance of transatlantic relations amid ongoing global challenges.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a mixed week, influenced by tariff announcements, strong earnings reports from Nvidia and Costco, and inflation data. President Trump's comments on trade with China and potential tariff increases caused market volatility, while Nvidia's impressive earnings and Costco's margin improvements provided positive momentum. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, but concerns remain about the potential for tariffs to reignite inflationary pressures. The CNBC Investing Club trimmed its position in Broadcom and downgraded both Broadcom and GE Vernova, while raising the price target for GE Vernova. The market's performance reflects the ongoing balancing act between economic growth, trade tensions, and monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is "the least" of what a woman's reproductive system does. During a podcast episode, Obama lamented that women's reproductive health has been reduced to the question of choice and claimed that a lack of research on women's health shapes male leaders' perceptions of abortion. Her remarks drew criticism from pro-life activists who emphasized the significance of motherhood. Some critics also suggested that Obama was dismissive of the miraculous ability of women to grow life. The podcast episode is available on YouTube and has garnered a moderate number of views.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults and is a mother of three, offers five simple rules for effective parenting. These rules include trusting parental instincts over influencers, following cultural traditions, focusing on each child's unique interests, prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist emphasizes the importance of love, attention, and emotional modulation in raising well-adjusted children. By following these guidelines, parents can navigate the complexities of modern parenting with greater confidence and joy. These principles aim to alleviate parental anxiety and promote a healthier approach to child-rearing.</p>

          <p>Sophie and Rocky Goldie purchased a 37.5-acre homestead in rural Kentucky for $390,000 and have spent the past year renovating it themselves, investing $13,000 in tools and interior improvements. The couple secured a 30-year mortgage and are determined to pay it off in under five years. They have focused on clearing the land, adding a garden and fruit trees, and renovating the 1840s log cabins on the property. Sophie says the most significant lesson she's learned is the impact a person can have on a piece of the planet, while Rocky has rediscovered his identity outside of his career.

          <p>Sharon Horgan, the Bafta award-winning actor, writer, producer, and director, revealed that she finally found confidence after the second series of her hit show "Bad Sisters" was released last year. Horgan had previously questioned her success, attributing it to being in the right place at the right time or having the right people around her. However, with "Bad Sisters," she felt a sense of ownership and belonging, despite the large team involved. Horgan also discussed how her initial lack of acting roles led her to writing, creating parts for herself and highlighting flawed women in her sitcoms. She expressed concern about female-led comedies being seen as a quota, limiting opportunities for other women. Her career has since thrived, with Horgan juggling multiple roles on her shows, but she admitted that her perfectionism sometimes caused issues on set.</p>

Norris admitted to making mistakes on his final run, preventing him from surpassing Piastri. Verstappen acknowledged that Turn One was problematic, and the car was not fast enough.

This has led to accusations that the scheduling implies female players are not worthy of the slot, which tournament director Amelie Mauresmo has rejected.

The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and enjoyed views from the largest windows of any operational spaceship. The New Shepard rocket climbed to nearly 65 miles above Earth before the capsule descended under parachutes for a landing in West Texas. Blue Origin has now launched 68 passengers since its first crewed flight in July 2021. The cost of a ticket is estimated to be upwards of $500,000 per seat. Blue Origin has had the sub-orbital passenger market to itself since June 2024 when competitor Virgin Galactic, retired its original rocketplane to focus on building two upgraded Delta-class spacecraft.</p>
