Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, is considered a strong candidate to take over at the City Ground. Nuno's departure came after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite having guided the club to a high Premier League finish and European qualification last season.

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a reform that makes lower-premium "copper plans" on the Obamacare exchanges accessible to most Americans. Previously, these more affordable plans were restricted, primarily to individuals under 30. By broadening eligibility through a "hardship exemption," the administration aims to lower healthcare costs for families and encourage uninsured individuals, particularly younger and healthier people, to purchase coverage. Proponents argue this will reduce premiums and stabilize the insurance market by improving the risk pool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially joined the contest to become the Labour Party's next deputy leader, following the resignation of Angela Rayner. She is the most senior cabinet member to enter the race so far, alongside Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Dame Emily Thornberry and backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy. The candidates face a tight deadline to secure the necessary nominations from fellow MPs to proceed to a vote by party members. The contest highlights different wings of the party, with Ribeiro-Addy representing the left and Phillipson positioned as a key government ally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a U.S. court has decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser or other assets, despite finding that the company illegally monopolized the search market. The judge, Amit Mehta, argued that the rapid emergence of generative AI has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape, potentially disrupting Google's long-standing dominance. This decision suggests that the threat of AI-powered search alternatives, like ChatGPT, was a key factor in avoiding a structural breakup, marking a pivotal moment where AI's influence has reshaped a major regulatory outcome.</p>

          <p>A long-running succession battle within the Murdoch family's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over News Corp and Fox Corp. The deal effectively buys out his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—who will receive approximately $1.1 billion each and cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding company shares. This resolution ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue under Lachlan, ending years of internal family conflict that famously inspired the TV show "Succession."</p>

Despite the rise of the populist right, Labour has a path to form a narrow majority coalition with smaller center-left parties.
