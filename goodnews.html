          <p>Home Depot is set to report its quarterly earnings, facing challenges such as high interest rates, a sluggish housing market, and potential cost pressures from increased tariffs. Despite spring being its peak sales season, fewer consumers are undertaking home purchases or major renovations due to higher borrowing costs. The company has been focusing on attracting more business from home professionals, acquiring SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion. Home Depot projects modest sales growth for fiscal 2025 but also anticipates a slight decline in adjusted earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers are warning of increased solar activity, including solar flares and storms, as an active region of the Sun rotates into view. A recent X2.7 flare, the most powerful of 2025, caused radio blackouts in parts of the Middle East. NASA cautions that ongoing solar eruptions could impact radio communications, power grids, navigation signals, and spacecraft. The Met Office forecasts potential auroras, including Northern Lights over the UK and Ireland. The sunspot AR4087 is particularly active and could lead to supercharged auroras as it aligns with Earth.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, significant sea-level rise remains a threat due to the continued melting of ice sheets. Research indicates that past periods with similar warming levels resulted in sea levels several meters higher than present. Current observations show an increasing rate of melting in Greenland and West Antarctica, while computer models predict sea-level rise will not slow or stop even if warming stabilizes. The researchers emphasize that every fraction of a degree of warming avoided can greatly limit the risks to coastal populations, with an estimated 230 million people living within one meter of current high tide lines.</p>

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, drawing parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis suggests that Biden's diagnosis presents an opportunity for him to demonstrate leadership on a human level, by openly sharing his experiences and emotions related to his illness. She argues that such candor could help restore trust with voters who may feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term. Davis emphasizes that personal revelations can transcend partisan politics and ideological debates, offering a chance for connection and understanding.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share more similarities than differences, particularly in their anti-establishment stances and conservative/populist ideologies. The article asserts that both men acted on their conservative ideas and were cherished by Republicans for it. It highlights Reagan's opposition to the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate the Departments of Education and Energy, drawing parallels to Trump's policies. The author contends that the Republican Party has embraced issues such as tax cuts, federalism, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance due to the influence of Reagan and Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has reduced a key mortgage reference rate in an attempt to stabilize its struggling property market, which has been a significant drag on the economy. The five-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.5 percent, following an earlier cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate. This move is part of Beijing's broader efforts to stimulate domestic demand and ensure economic stability, particularly amid heightened external risks. Analysts, however, believe that the moderate rate cut may not be sufficient to fully revive the property sector.</p>

After an initial failed attempt due to strong winds, Smith successfully delivered the flotation device, allowing the girl to stay afloat until first responders arrived.

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a primary roll thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been dormant for two decades, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft. The decision to reactivate the thruster was made due to concerns about the backup thrusters, which had been in use since 2004 and were showing signs of potential failure. The successful test of the primary thruster occurred just before a critical ground-based radio antenna, essential for communicating with Voyager 1, was taken offline for upgrades. This fix ensures that Voyager 1 can continue its decades-long journey and potentially celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

President Xi Jinping's announcement of a $9.1 billion credit line, infrastructure investments, and visa exemptions for several Latin American countries is the latest example of China positioning itself as a reliable partner. While China's economy is growing less than before and the new credit line is less than what China offered in 2015, this loan allows China to project itself as a more trustworthy partner for the region than Washington.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly embracing AI due to labor shortages and a cultural acceptance of technology, despite concerns about copyright infringement. Japan's Copyright Act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models without the copyright holder's consent. While many Japanese artists worry about AI infringing on their copyrights, the anime industry faces a labor crunch due to poor working conditions. AI is seen as a solution to fill the gap and assist with tasks like coloring and background generation, but is not expected to replace human creativity.</p>
