          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, fueled by dry soil conditions and strong winds from thunderstorms, created hazardous driving conditions and reduced visibility to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport. Such dust storms are uncommon in the region, with the last significant event occurring during the Dust Bowl era. The dry soil moisture in the area is exceptionally low, contributing to the severity of the storm.</p>

His images, featured in a new book, aim to celebrate the often-overlooked stories of birds, mammals, and insects living alongside humans. Fusek Peters' work also serves as a "rallying cry" to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens. The project gained significance after his cancer diagnosis in 2018, leading him to develop techniques for capturing unique images of birds in flight.</p>
