          <p>Britain and the European Union are exploring a new partnership focused on security, trade, and youth mobility, marking a potential shift in relations post-Brexit. The proposed security pact aims to enhance cooperation on defense, economic security, and transnational crime, while a 'veterinary' deal seeks to reduce border checks on food and drink. A youth mobility deal, allowing under-30s to live and work in each other's countries, is also under consideration, though with potential limitations on numbers and visa requirements. This initiative is viewed by some as a pragmatic step forward, while others fear it could undermine the UK's sovereignty and diverge from the original goals of Brexit. Optimism surrounds potential economic benefits and strengthened security ties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Grocery Outlet store in Hemet, California, is enforcing a new policy requiring customers to leave their reusable shopping bags with the cashier due to a surge in retail theft. The store owners, Matthew and Allison Whitlow, announced the policy on Facebook, citing an increase in customers leaving without paying for merchandise. Customers are encouraged to use store-provided hand baskets instead, and the owners are offering assistance to shoppers struggling to afford groceries. This policy is part of a broader effort to address retail theft issues in California, where state officials have dispatched additional law enforcement resources to affected areas.</p>

Speaker Mike Johnson is working to address these concerns, but faces a tough road ahead as the Republican majority can only withstand a limited number of defections.
