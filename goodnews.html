          <p>President Trump announced a framework for a trade deal with the United Kingdom, emphasizing that while not finalized, it signifies a commitment to reciprocity and fairness in international trade. The deal aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers that discriminated against American products. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick noted that a 10% tariff on imports from Britain would remain, generating revenue for the United States. The announcement follows Trump's broader effort to overhaul the global trading system through tariffs, with the U.K. being the first such agreement since the pause in reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a surge after President Trump revealed a new trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K., with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all showing gains.

Despite the positive market reaction, UBS Global Wealth Management advises investors to prepare for continued volatility. The Federal Reserve cited uncertainty around trade policies when deciding to keep its benchmark interest rate steady.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding the U.S.-U.K. trade deal announcement. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its status as a bounceback asset amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, highlighted Bitcoin's resilience and safe haven status, supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and demand from spot-ETF investors. However, Trenchev cautioned that Bitcoin's resilience would be tested further in an uncertain global environment, citing rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era characterized by loud egos and increasing unhappiness, cultivating a quiet ego is presented as a countercultural strategy for personal well-being. Psychologists define quiet ego as a self-identity that balances self-focus with consideration for others. It encompasses virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope, and is associated with better mood balance, life satisfaction, and a greater sense of life's meaning. The article suggests practical steps for acquiring these virtues, including questioning conventional wisdom, prioritizing the needs of others, and cultivating detached self-awareness.</p>

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined remotely, expressing optimism about the future. Despite the agreement, U.S. tariffs on the UK will remain at 10%, while UK duties on U.S. goods will decrease.</p>

          <p>A jury acquitted Nicola Packer, 45, of unlawfully administering a poison or noxious substance with intent to procure a miscarriage. The case centered around Packer taking abortion medicine at home during a coronavirus lockdown when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, exceeding the legal limit for home use. Packer testified that she was unaware of how far along she was in her pregnancy, and that she would not have taken the medication if she knew she was that far along. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists called for abortion law reform, deeming the current law outdated and harmful.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst, Geoffrey Kendrick, has apologized for his earlier prediction of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025, stating that the target "may be too low." Kendrick's revised outlook is driven by significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and increased institutional interest. Bitcoin has once again surpassed the $100,000 level, with analysts observing a pattern of the cryptocurrency trading similarly to risk assets such as U.S. technology stocks.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, signaling that more reductions may follow in the coming months. Governor Andrew Bailey noted the potential impact of the global trade war on UK economic growth and welcomed the UK-US trade deal as a positive sign. The Bank's decision to lower rates was influenced by concerns over the potential impact of trade tensions and expectations for lower inflation due to diverted cheap goods from countries like China. The move is expected to impact mortgage rates and monthly repayments for homeowners with tracker mortgages.</p>
