          <p>Nell Wulfhart, a decision coach, suggests individuals often overthink decisions due to fear of regret, advising to minimize deliberation for faster clarity. She recommends creating a list of personal values and envisioning an ideal life in the future to align choices with long-term goals. Wulfhart emphasizes that some regret is inevitable and encourages testing options to gather tangible data for informed decisions. She also cautions against seeking advice from too many people, suggesting limiting input to three to five supportive individuals with relevant experience to streamline the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines will launch its first European route with nonstop service from Seattle to Rome, beginning next May, utilizing Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jets. This expansion is facilitated by Alaska's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, granting access to long-haul aircraft, with flights scheduled four times a week. The airline intends to establish Seattle as a global gateway, adding more long-haul international destinations throughout the decade, aiming to serve major demand markets. Tickets for the new route will go on sale this fall, marking a significant step in Alaska Airlines' international expansion strategy.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% increase in U.S. sales for May, driven by an employee pricing program and a rise in hybrid vehicle sales, despite a drop in electric vehicle sales. The automaker's gains in traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids offset a 25% decline in EV sales compared to the previous year. The employee pricing program, which continues through the Fourth of July weekend, was introduced as President Trump's auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect. Ford has also announced price increases on some vehicles imported from Mexico, citing seasonal adjustments and tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>Efforts by President Trump and congressional Republicans to mandate proof of citizenship for voter registration are encountering difficulties at both federal and state levels.

In Texas, a sweeping bill requiring proof of citizenship for all registered voters failed to pass the legislature, with concerns raised about implementation and voter inconvenience.

While basic costs have fallen due to lower energy bills, the expenses associated with moderate and comfortable retirement standards have increased.
