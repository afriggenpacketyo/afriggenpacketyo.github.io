          <p>President Trump announced he is doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, celebrating a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. He stated the tariff increase would further secure the steel industry in the United States, and that the tariffs would also apply to imported aluminum, effective June 4. Trump praised the Nippon deal, suggesting it would revitalize the American steelmaker and ensure job security for steelworkers, promising a $5,000 bonus for each worker. (not investment advice) The announcement comes after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed his tariffs to remain in effect, but the United Steelworkers union remains wary of the Nippon deal's impact on national security.</p>

He emphasized that U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, promising no layoffs and a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. Trump asserted that U.S. Steel would still be "controlled by the USA," but did not specify how the ownership would be structured, despite previously opposing such a merger.</p>

          <p>USC baseball earned its first NCAA tournament win in a decade, dominating TCU with a 13-1 victory in the opening game of the Corvallis Regional. The Trojans piled up 14 hits and forced TCU to cycle through its bullpen after chasing the starting pitcher in the fourth inning. Pitcher Caden Aoki delivered eight sterling innings, and Richard Tejeda was a catalyst for the Trojans' offense. USC advances to the winner's bracket to face the winner of Saint Mary's and Oregon State.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is suing President Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing the president of retaliating against the public broadcaster over "perceived political slights in news coverage." Trump's executive order targeting PBS' funding "will upend public television," according to the lawsuit. PBS argues that the Constitution and the law governing public television forbid Trump from attempting to defund PBS or "serving as the arbiter" of its programming.</p>
