        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe informed U.S. lawmakers that recent American military strikes delivered a monumental setback to Iran's nuclear program, destroying its only metal conversion facility at the Isfahan site. This facility is crucial for transforming enriched uranium gas into metal, a key step for building a nuclear bomb core. While the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, confirmed severe damage but noted it was not total, Ratcliffe asserted the loss has removed Tehran's ability to build a weapon for years. The intelligence community also assesses that Iran's air defense was shattered, leaving any rebuilding efforts vulnerable to future strikes.</p>

          <p>A young male mountain lion cub, discovered with a fractured skull and other severe injuries after being hit by a vehicle, has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center spent nearly five months rehabilitating the cub, carefully providing medical care while ensuring it did not become habituated to humans. Staff focused on pain management and nutrition before moving the animal to an outdoor enclosure to encourage natural survival behaviors. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating an avoidance of people, the cub was released by wildlife officials into a remote area of Orange County.</p>

          <p>Despite being declared extinct in 1986, the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, remains a subject of intense fascination and dedicated searching in Australia. Thousands of reported sightings, though none officially confirmed, continue to fuel the passion of enthusiasts who use trail cams and forensic techniques to find evidence of the creature's survival. The obsession is not just in the wild; a de-extinction project, backed by tech investors, aims to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists call the project impossible, the enduring hope reflects a collective remorse for the animal's extinction and a deep connection to a lost part of Australia's natural heritage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, is renowned for his six-decade career creating over 70 feature films and documentaries that explore the extremes of human nature and the indifference of the natural world. Known for films like "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" and "Grizzly Man," Herzog's work often delves into themes of obsession, madness, and survival, shot in some of the planet's most remote locations. He famously pushes boundaries, once hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog continues to work, teaching aspiring filmmakers to embrace a "good criminal energy" and believing his prose and poetry will ultimately outlive his cinematic achievements.</p>

          <p>Sealand, a former World War II anti-aircraft fort in the North Sea, stands as the world's smallest self-declared sovereign state. Founded in 1967 by Roy Bates as a romantic gesture for his wife, the principality has its own currency, constitution, and a history of fending off pirate radio rivals and a coup attempt by German and Dutch merchants. The nation's sovereignty claim is bolstered by a 1978 incident where a German diplomat's visit to negotiate a hostage release constituted de facto recognition. Today, the Bates royal family funds the nation, which has one permanent resident, by selling noble titles online, embodying a unique story of freedom and defiance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog employs a highly unconventional and intuitive process to create his distinctive documentaries, which he considers a form of poetry rather than journalism. Rejecting storyboards and transcripts, he and his editor watch all raw footage only once, with Herzog taking notes and marking compelling shots with exclamation points. He then builds the film shot-by-shot, spontaneously writing and recording his philosophical narration to imbue images with deeper meaning and emotion. This method aims to transport audiences beyond mere information and into a dreamlike reality, creating memorable sequences that explore fundamental questions about existence, such as whether fish have souls.</p>

Mahboubi observed a warm and welcoming reception for his students, indicating a desire for engagement despite high-level political friction.

This outing marks a significant turnaround for Wrobleski, who has lowered his ERA and increased his fastball velocity since a difficult start earlier in the season. His recent success, including giving up only four earned runs in his last 20 innings, is elevating his status as a valuable depth option for the team's pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise could feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Speaking at an automotive event, Diesel said he gave Universal Studios three conditions for the finale, slated for April 2027: bringing the story back to Los Angeles, returning to street-racing roots, and reuniting his character with O'Conner. Walker, who died in 2013, last appeared in "Furious 7" through a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and stand-in performances by his brothers. The potential return revives debates over the ethics and execution of posthumous digital performances in major film franchises.</p>

The measure had faced backlash from at least nine fellow Republicans in the House and Senate, as well as conservation and recreation advocates.

The 23-year-old Chelsea player, who was a breakout star at the last World Cup, is considered a key component of the Lionesses' attack as they look to defend their European title. While her fitness for a full 90-minute match is still being built, her versatility and game-changing talent provide a major tactical advantage for manager Sarina Wiegman.</p>
