          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. His spokesperson, Michael Ragusa, detailed injuries including fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations, and contusions to his left arm and lower leg, though all were described as non-life-threatening. The incident occurred Saturday night, with state police responding to a nearby domestic violence report. Giuliani had reportedly stopped to assist a domestic violence victim and contacted 911 prior to the collision, which his spokesperson later clarified was not a targeted attack, despite its dramatic nature. His son, Andrew, expressed pride in his father's resilience following the incident, which saw both vehicles heavily damaged.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, effectively halting the Trump administration's expedited deportation of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children. This urgent ruling came as planes were already prepared for takeoff, preventing the removal of 76 minors who lacked formal deportation orders and potentially valid asylum claims. The Justice Department contended these were repatriations requested by Guatemala and the children's families, a claim vehemently disputed by the children's attorneys who cite federal laws protecting their right to seek asylum and appear before an immigration judge. This legal intervention underscores a significant conflict over the due process rights of vulnerable migrant children, ensuring they remain in U.S. custody for the next 14 days while their cases are properly reviewed, amidst concerns of potential abuse or persecution upon return. The broader implications involve the administration's aggressive immigration policies and the legal safeguards for minors.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed a significant £125 million deal to acquire Newcastle United forward Alexander Isak, a move that would rank among the most expensive player transfers in recent football history. This high-profile agreement comes as Premier League clubs are in the final stages of solidifying their squads before the transfer window closes. Isak, who has been a pivotal attacking force for Newcastle, is expected to bring considerable talent and goal-scoring ability to Liverpool's offensive lineup. The transfer could significantly impact both clubs' strategies for the upcoming season, with further announcements regarding the deal's specifics and the player's personal terms eagerly awaited by fans and analysts.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the game’s fifth-largest prize in history, after no ticket successfully matched all six winning numbers on Saturday. Nine tickets across the U.S. did manage to match all five white balls, with four of these fortunate tickets sold in California, each securing a prize of over $1.1 million. A prospective winner of Monday’s massive jackpot would have the choice between receiving periodic payments totaling an estimated $1.1 billion or opting for a lump sum estimated at $498.4 million, with both options calculated before taxes. The odds of winning the grand prize remain a challenging 1 in 292.2 million, as the last jackpot winner was recorded on May 31.</p>

This emerging trend signals a notable shift in aspirations for some Chinese youth, who traditionally might have sought fortunes in the United States or Europe. Their migration reflects a broader re-evaluation of global economic landscapes and a proactive search for new avenues in the rapidly developing Southeast Asian market.</p>

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first lunar rover, marking the country's inaugural Canadian-led planetary exploration endeavor, with a scheduled launch in 2029 as part of NASA's Artemis program. This 35kg rover will land on the Moon's south polar region, a notoriously inhospitable environment, to search for water and measure radiation levels, crucial data for future human missions. Engineers at Canadensys face immense challenges, including designing components to withstand lunar nights plunging to -200C and days soaring to 100C, and navigating the abrasive "Velcro dirt" regolith. The potential confirmation of water on the Moon could revolutionize sustainable space exploration, even allowing the Moon to become a "petrol station" for spacecraft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compiles numerous firsthand accounts from both doctors and patients, detailing seemingly "mild" symptoms that unexpectedly revealed very serious underlying health conditions. Examples include a "double heartbeat" that was diagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia, unexplained jaw and ear pain later linked to heart attacks, and persistent exhaustion pointing to a parathyroid adenoma. Other crucial warnings cover sudden vision changes indicating a detached retina, persistent joint pain in children that led to leukemia diagnoses, and calf pain as a sign of dangerous blood clots. The collection emphasizes the critical importance of vigilance and seeking timely medical attention for any minor or persistent bodily changes, as early detection can be pivotal for life-saving interventions.</p>

          <p>A global surge in matcha popularity, driven by its superfood reputation on platforms like TikTok and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has transformed the green powder into a lucrative commodity, often referred to as "green gold." Japan's green tea exports, especially powdered matcha, have quadrupled in a decade, with the U.S. emerging as the largest market. This "matcha mania" has, however, led to significant supply shortages even within Japan, with prices for tencha, the specific tea used for matcha, jumping by 170% in Kyoto. The Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to boost tencha cultivation, but labor-intensive production and concerns about the boom's sustainability pose ongoing challenges, leading some shops to ration their supply.</p>

          <p>Will Smith's dramatic pinch-hit, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning rescued the Los Angeles Dodgers from a potential three-game sweep by the Arizona Diamondbacks. The 5-4 victory, secured despite the Dodgers blowing a late-game, three-run lead and Tanner Scott surrendering a tying three-run blast, moved the team two games up in the National League West standings. Manager Dave Roberts had explicitly urged his team to play with more "pride" and "fight" after two disappointing losses in the series. Smith, who had been mired in a deep slump, delivered a crucial 420-foot missile, marking his fourth career pinch-hit walk-off homer and providing a much-needed morale boost for the team.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles men's team achieved a historic "three-peat" in The Hundred 2025, dominating the cricket tournament for three consecutive years with what former England captain Michael Vaughan called "all the skillsets required." Their sustained success is largely attributed to expert team building by coach Tom Moody, a strong collective skillset, and maintaining a consistent core of players, which is a rarity in franchise cricket. Key strategies included extensive use of leg-spin bowling and powerful late-innings batting, leading to an impressive 78% win rate over three seasons. However, their era of dominance may be ending as new investment and ownership structures, potentially leading to a format change to T20 and a new auction system, threaten to dismantle the current squad.</p>

She emphasized the film's focus on Shakespeare as a husband and father, and the universal themes of loss and existence, drawing on Jungian psychology and Hindu Tantra. Zhao aims to portray grief honestly, believing that the historical silence around it has caused "great damage," and views this film as a profound personal catharsis.</p>
