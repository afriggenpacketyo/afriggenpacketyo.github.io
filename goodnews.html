          <p>A train traveling from Manchester to Cardiff collided with a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Leominster, Herefordshire, causing significant disruption to rail services. While the train did not derail, several of the 56 passengers on board sustained minor injuries, and six people were assessed by medics at the scene. The incident prompted the deployment of emergency services, including an air ambulance, land ambulances, and fire crews. An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances leading up to the crash, which occurred on a farm track used by agricultural vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling blocking the state's plan to establish the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which would have integrated Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The deadlock means the lower court's decision stands, preventing Oklahoma from using taxpayer money for the school. The ruling sets no nationwide precedent on whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor religious charter schools, leaving the broader question open for future consideration in other cases. The lack of a majority decision means the issue may return to the Supreme Court in the future with a case from another state. </p>

          <p>The UK has signed an agreement to cede the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while leasing back a crucial military base on Diego Garcia for ¬£101 million annually. The deal, signed virtually by Sir Keir Starmer, grants Mauritius sovereignty over the islands, allowing the US and UK to continue operating the military base for an initial 99-year period. The agreement aims to safeguard the base's long-term viability and protect the UK from potential interference, though it has faced criticism from opposition politicians who question the cost and strategic implications. The High Court dismissed a legal challenge brought by Chagossian women seeking to return to the islands, excluding Diego Garcia.</p>

While education unions have generally welcomed the decision, they have warned of potential cuts to school budgets. Health unions have expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, excluding doctors, dentists, and senior managers, though resident doctors will receive an average increase of 5.4% due to a ¬£750 top-up.</p>

The provision, effective in 2025, aims to provide tax relief to filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. However, the bill also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap.

          <p>After a disastrous breakup, Melissa Febos vows celibacy to get closer to herself, not God. She revels in the sensuality of solitude and the pursuit of her art, a practice she situates in a long lineage of women who have made similar trade-offs. Febos joins Benedictine abbess Hildegard von Bingen and authors Virginia Woolf and Octavia Butler, to name a few, in a long lineage of women making similar sacrifices. This new book is set to be released on June 3rd.</p>

          <p>The market's rapid bounce back to near-record highs over the past month has not been kind to investors betting against US stocks. From the market bottom on April 8 through May 20, short sellers have lost more than $250 billion, according to data from S3 Partners. All of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks were among the top 20 names on which short investors lost the most money. Shorts on Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) lost more than $19 billion combined during the period. (not investment advice)</p>
