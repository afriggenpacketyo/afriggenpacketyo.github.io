He was pardoned, according to rights group Viasna, after being jailed for challenging Alexander Lukashenko in an election. Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in his place, thanked the US for its efforts in a video released after his release. The release coincided with a visit from US Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with potential daily record highs forecast for parts of the Rockies, Plains, mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. The heat wave is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend, and arrive in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday through the first half of next week. Staying indoors with air conditioning and staying hydrated are the best ways to stay safe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say US sunscreens may be less effective than those available abroad, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences are cited as a key reason, with the FDA's approval process for new UV filters being lengthy. Other countries have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on cloudy days.</p>

The photos also feature laundry and buckets to highlight the women's inescapable connection to contaminated water. The work aims to underscore their courage and resilience.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms, citing its unconstitutionality. Civil liberties groups argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry supports appealing the ruling, while the state attorney general believes the decision only applies to specific districts. The case is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, testing the issue of religion and government. The ruling is a victory for civil liberties.</p>
