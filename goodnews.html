          <p>David Beckham is anticipated to be knighted in King Charles' Birthday Honours list, adding to his previous appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003. This recognition celebrates Beckham's achievements in football, including 115 appearances for England and successful stints with Manchester United, LA Galaxy, Paris St-Germain, and AC Milan, as well as his contributions to British society. Beckham was initially nominated for a knighthood in 2011, and despite leaked emails in 2017 criticizing the honors system, his role in securing the London 2012 Olympics and his ambassadorships for Unicef and the King's Foundation have solidified his candidacy. The award highlights Beckham's continued positive impact beyond his athletic career.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological findings in Shandong, eastern China, suggest that a matrilineal community thrived around 4,500 years ago, marking it as the world's earliest known society of this kind. Researchers analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals dating between 2750 and 2500 BC, confirming the existence of a Neolithic society that traced lineage through the female line. The community farmed millet, raised animals, and potentially engaged in fishing, maintaining a stable lineage for at least 10 generations over 250 years. The discovery supports the idea that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the rationale behind Donald Trump's travel ban, which includes full restrictions on citizens of 12 countries and partial constraints on seven others, several of which are African nations. The policy is part of an immigration crackdown aimed at addressing security threats, according to Trump. An exemption within the order could apply to participants in the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympics, ensuring minimal disruption to these events. Organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics expressed confidence that the ban would not affect the Games or their preparations, acknowledging special consideration for the Olympics in the directive.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 5.1% increase in premarket trading following a $152 billion rout fueled by tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's "big, beautiful bill," leading to a verbal exchange between the two. Trump initially praised Musk's handling of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but his tone shifted after Musk's critical comments. Musk's remarks about the bill being a "disgusting abomination" prompted Trump to suggest their relationship may be strained, leading to market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite challenges such as geopolitical tensions and rising interest rates, attendees expressed confidence in growth areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers.

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a five-year plan to enhance the country's infrastructure resilience against disasters, allocating over 20 trillion yen ($139 billion) to the project. The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and includes 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. The approval comes after prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake in 2024 and a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture caused by sewer pipe corrosion.

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May due to fluctuating tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, with economists forecasting the addition of 125,000 jobs, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000. The U.S.-China trade agreement in May reduced tit-for-tat tariffs, boosting the stock market, while the White House paused some of Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. Despite these actions, an across-the-board 10% tariff remains on nearly all imports, excluding semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, with China facing 30% tariffs. Major companies have warned of potential losses due to tariff-related uncertainty, though key economic measures have largely defied fears of a downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

By serving these warrants on local officials, the program ensures that local authorities hand over the illegal criminal aliens to ICE.

The Transportation Department is seeking ideas from private companies and estimates the project will cost tens of billions of dollars.
