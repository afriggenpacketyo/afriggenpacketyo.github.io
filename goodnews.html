        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study highlights a significant and growing demand for artificial intelligence skills across various industries, leading employers to offer substantial salary premiums for skilled workers. Job postings explicitly mentioning at least one AI skill advertise, on average, 28% higher pay, with this premium rising to 43% for individuals possessing two or more AI-related competencies. Interestingly, the surge in demand is particularly pronounced in non-tech sectors like marketing, sales, and customer support, which have seen an 800% increase in generative AI skill mentions since 2022. Experts underscore the critical importance of developing AI literacy at all career levels, emphasizing that opportunities abound for those who adapt to this evolving technological landscape.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden recently underwent surgery for skin cancer, a procedure that appears successful, as evidenced by a fresh scar observed on his head. This health update comes months after he revealed a diagnosis of aggressive stage-four prostate cancer in May, which had metastasized to his bones and received a high Gleason score of nine. Despite the seriousness, his office indicated the prostate cancer is hormone-sensitive, suggesting it can be effectively managed with various treatment options currently under consideration. The former First Lady, Jill Biden, also had basal cell carcinomas removed in 2023, underscoring a shared health concern within the family.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka displayed immense grit, rallying from a set deficit to defeat Jessica Pegula 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the US Open semifinals, earning her a third consecutive spot in the New York final. Despite facing a challenging season without a major title win, the world number one maintained her composure, overcoming a strong challenge from the fourth-seeded American. Sabalenka's victory is particularly notable as she has previously struggled with emotional control in this year's Grand Slam semifinals, but she managed to keep her focus to secure this crucial win. She now prepares to face either two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka or American Amanda Anisimova in Saturday's highly anticipated showpiece match.</p>

          <p>A bankruptcy attorney from Indiana, Mark S. Zuckerberg, is suing Facebook, claiming the social media platform repeatedly suspended his account over eight years due to false accusations of "impersonating a celebrity." The lawyer asserts that these account shutdowns led to thousands of dollars in lost business, particularly from $11,000 worth of advertisements that were improperly taken down. Facebook's parent company, Meta, has since reinstated his account and acknowledged the error, stating they are working to prevent recurrence. Zuckerberg, who has been practicing law for 38 years—predating the tech mogul's fame—highlights the frustrating mix-ups caused by his shared name.</p>

An analysis of Powerball data highlights considerable variations in the after-tax payouts for winners across different states, primarily influenced by state-level income taxes on lottery prizes. While a mandatory 24% federal withholding applies, states such as California, Florida, and Texas do not levy additional taxes, enabling winners there to keep a significantly larger portion of their prize compared to those in states like New York, which has the lowest after-tax annuitized payout.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally saw gains after President Trump formalized a reduced 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports and issued warnings about upcoming "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not producing in the U.S. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose, supported by an increase in July household spending. Several Asian chip stocks, including Advantest, Lasertec, and TSMC, experienced climbs, anticipating exemptions for firms investing in U.S. manufacturing. U.S. equity futures showed little change ahead of the August jobs report, while overnight, all three major U.S. benchmarks increased, fueled by optimism for a favorable jobs report that could support a Federal Reserve rate cut.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, suggested that enterprises are unlikely to widely adopt agentic AI browsers within the next two years unless significant controls are implemented to address credential and enterprise security concerns. While recognizing the convenience these autonomous browsers offer consumers for tasks like booking flights, Arora emphasized their inherent conflict with corporate security protocols, where companies are wary of granting AI agents excessive autonomy. He underscored that credential theft is a leading cause of data breaches, which informs his company's planned $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk, an identity security provider. This strategic move aims to fortify the management of "crown jewels" and privileged access for all users within an organization.</p>

          <p>A fact-check article has debunked a digitally altered image of President Donald Trump depicting him with a "puffy face," which had spread widely online and contributed to unfounded rumors about his health. The manipulated image, shared by various social media users and even California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office, was traced back to an authentic Associated Press photograph from July 2022. Newsom's office subsequently acknowledged the image was edited, stating its intent was to satirize the President. This incident highlights a recurring issue of misinformation regarding Trump's well-being, although the White House had confirmed in July 2025 that he has chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition for individuals over 70.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has affirmed an injunction, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing its policy that sought to restrict transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports accurately reflecting their gender identities. This ruling is a significant development stemming from an executive order signed by President Trump, which aimed to recognize only binary biological genders on passports, thereby overturning a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that Trump's policy was unconstitutional, based on "irrational prejudice," and would inflict immediate and irreparable harm upon affected individuals. Neither the White House nor the State Department has issued an immediate comment on the court's decision.</p>

          <p>China's Hunan province is pioneering a novel application for its digital yuan, or e-CNY, by exploring its use to resolve long-delayed "chain debts," thereby significantly broadening the currency's functional scope. This initiative seeks to enhance transparency and traceability within the financial system by enabling direct fund transfers to the ultimate recipients in a payment chain. While detailed implementation plans are still being formulated, analysts believe this approach could substantially improve real-time oversight and control over economic transactions, potentially mitigating persistent payment defaults. This strategic move signifies a deeper integration of the digital yuan into China's financial infrastructure, aiming to address complex economic challenges and improve efficiency.</p>

These high-profile acquisitions underscore the newly promoted club's ambitious investment strategy under its wealthy American owner, Michele Kang, who aims to challenge the established hierarchy in women's football. Geyoro, a seasoned French international, is expected to substantially elevate the team's performance and market appeal. Operating as an independent club without a men's team affiliation, the Lionesses are pioneering a unique, women-focused organizational model, potentially setting a new standard for the sport's development and commercialization.</p>

          <p>Tattoos are progressively being recognized as a legitimate art form, with a significant increase in prevalence, now adorning a third of American adults, reflecting a societal shift towards greater openness and individuality. Despite this mainstream acceptance, particularly among millennials, a notable social stigma continues to persist. Research indicates that individuals with tattoos may still encounter biases in professional settings and trust perceptions, even though these are not linked to their lifestyle or personality. Tracee Glab, executive director of the Flint Institute of Arts, noted the historical resistance to featuring tattoos in fine art, although a current exhibit showcasing Michigan tattoo artists is actively challenging these outdated perceptions.</p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is reporting significant positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which enforces a comprehensive ban on student cellphone use throughout the school day. At Lakeside High School, the largest in DeKalb County, teachers have observed a marked improvement in the learning environment and student engagement, while Principal Susan Stoddard highlighted a substantial decrease in disruptions and an overall enhancement in student conduct. This successful local initiative predates a statewide ban on K-8 cellphone use in Georgia, scheduled for 2026, with DeKalb and other counties adopting even stricter rules that encompass high schools. The program effectively addresses digital distractions, fostering a more focused and productive educational atmosphere.</p>
