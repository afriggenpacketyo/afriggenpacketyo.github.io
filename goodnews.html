          <p>President Trump signed executive orders intended to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors in the United States. The orders seek to streamline the licensing process for nuclear reactors, mandating decisions within 18 months, and encourage uranium mining and enrichment. The administration aims to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors on federal land for national security purposes and to power critical defense facilities. These actions are part of a broader effort to boost investment in nuclear power, which has faced financial challenges in recent years due to competition from cheap natural gas. </p>

          <p>Eight individuals were found guilty in a Paris court for their involvement in the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian during Paris Fashion Week, where millions of dollars' worth of jewelry were stolen. The defendants, comprising three pensioners and one man in his 30s, faced charges ranging from direct participation in the heist to aiding the plot. Kardashian testified that she feared for her life during the robbery, which prompted her to increase her security measures and limit real-time personal information shared online. The stolen jewelry, including a diamond engagement ring, was never recovered, but Kardashian received an insurance payout of approximately $6 million. </p>

DOGE claims that it has terminated five "wasteful" surveys, but it did not specify which surveys were ended.

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes new tax rules that could have a significant financial impact on millions of workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The bill proposes eliminating federal income taxes on tips for workers earning less than $160,000 annually, which could save each tipped worker about $1,700 per year. The bill also includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime pay. However, some policy experts say that the tax breaks may not be as useful as they first appear, as almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax. </p>

          <p>Disney has sued YouTube and its former executive Justin Connolly for breach of contract, alleging that Connolly violated an employment agreement by joining YouTube. Connolly, who was president of platform distribution at Disney, oversaw the company's distribution strategy and third-party media sales for streaming services like Disney+ and its television networks. Disney claims that Connolly's move to YouTube, where he will be in charge of the platform's relationships with media companies and its live sports portfolio, would be extremely prejudicial to Disney. The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction against Connolly and YouTube to enforce its employment contract.</p>
