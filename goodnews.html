          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a deal with China has been reached, pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, aimed at easing tensions between the two countries. According to Trump, China will supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US will roll back threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. The agreement follows intense talks in London to resolve conflicts that emerged after a truce in May. While details are limited, officials suggest the agreement will not alter the broad outlines of the May truce, which lowered tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that current U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will not change, despite ongoing trade discussions between Washington and Beijing. President Trump indicated that U.S. duties on China would total 55%, which a White House official clarified is the sum of existing tariffs. The announcement follows high-level talks in London, where a framework was reached, subject to final approval by Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, as agreed last month to temporarily reduce retaliatory duties.</p>

          <p>A survey indicates that some parents are adding their young children, including toddlers, as authorized users on their credit cards to help them establish credit at an early age. This practice allows children to build credit history with each purchase, potentially improving their credit score. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of a good credit score for securing better rates on mortgages, car loans, and even employment opportunities. Parents are advised to pay bills in full and on time to avoid negatively impacting their child's credit score and to monitor for unauthorized purchases.</p>
