Goldman Sachs, a lead underwriter for both deals, stands to benefit from renewed IPO activity, as investment banking contributes significantly to its revenues. However, uncertainty around trade policies had previously dampened IPO activity, but easing trade tensions have emboldened companies to go public.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax experts suggest appealing property taxes, as many properties are over-assessed, leading to homeowners paying more than they should. Appealing involves demonstrating how the assessor incorrectly applied the assessment formula to your house, such as inaccuracies in square footage or the age of the roof. Comparing your property to neighbors' homes and checking for available tax exemptions are key steps in the appeal process. Successful appeals typically take effect for the current tax year, providing several years of savings.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unraveled the mystery behind flamingos' unusual eating behavior, revealing it as a sophisticated application of fluid dynamics. The birds create vortices in the water with almost every move, including bobbing their heads and stomping their feet. The shape of their bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water. The study finds that flamingos' webbed toes create a pair of vortices that push food towards their bills. This research may have implications for improving water filtration technologies.</p>
