          <p>Wall Street experienced a consolidation after a rally driven by the U.S.-United Kingdom trade deal framework, with the S&P 500 remaining flat for the week. The market's vulnerability to a pullback was attributed to an overbought S&P Short Range Oscillator. Investors are closely watching U.S.-China trade talks for potential de-escalation. CrowdStrike faced a noisy week, including news of layoffs and a probe into a $32 million software contract, which the CEO defended as compliant with accounting principles.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Supreme Court Justice appointed by President George H.W. Bush, has died at 85. Souter, a New Hampshire Republican, became a key member of the court's liberal wing, disappointing conservatives. Known for his preference for solitude and intellectual pursuits, Souter retired at 69 to return to New Hampshire, opening a Supreme Court vacancy for President Barack Obama. His jurisprudence was influenced by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, emphasizing the Constitution as a charter of "ordered liberty" that evolves over time.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled. Experts predict the half-ton object could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While most of the spacecraft is expected to burn up, there is a small chance that some parts, including the landing capsule, could survive reentry. The risk to humans is considered low, similar to that of a random meteorite fall, but cannot be completely excluded.</p>

Risher points to specific lessons he picked up from Gates at Microsoft, where Risher was the general manager in charge of the Access database, and under Bezos at Amazon, where he was the tech giant's senior vice president of retail.
