          <p>Marks & Spencer has introduced a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, inspired by the viral Japanese "fruit sando." This unique item, consisting of strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, became the store's top-selling sandwich shortly after its launch. While new to UK supermarkets, fruit sandwiches are a long-standing snack in Japan, often enjoyed with tea or coffee. The article explores the cultural context of the fruit sando and compares it to other unconventional sandwiches from around the world, questioning the very definition of a sandwich.</p>

After being vacant for nearly three decades, the historic structure will reopen in July as Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate, a six-suite wellness retreat. The restoration project, led by a Nagoya-based company with strong ties to the city, preserves many of the building's original architectural elements while adding modern amenities like private saunas.

          <p>Researchers are investigating bacteriophages, viruses that exclusively infect and kill bacteria, as a promising alternative to antibiotics. The article follows a journalist who collects a sample from his toilet and discovers it contains a phage capable of killing a patient's persistent infection in a lab setting. This century-old concept, known as phage therapy, was largely abandoned after the advent of antibiotics but is seeing renewed interest due to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. While challenges remain, they represent a potential weapon against incurable superbugs.</p>

Feeling isolated, she spent over 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had known since elementary school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, a gesture that was met with surprise and admiration. The project not only helped Schafer feel seen again but also prompted feelings of regret among her classmates for not reaching out sooner, serving as a powerful lesson in empathy and connection.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order aimed at punishing the law firm Susman Godfrey, calling it "unconstitutional from beginning to end." This marks the fourth such ruling against a series of orders targeting elite law firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. The punitive orders sought to suspend security clearances and end government contracts with the firms. Judges in all four cases have found the orders to be an attack on the firms' constitutional rights and a threat to the independence of the legal profession.</p>

Frontman Matty Healy engaged the audience with his signature mix of anxious energy and verbose, self-aware banter, at one point jokingly declaring himself a "generational poet."

          <p>Australia claimed a 159-run victory over the West Indies in their first Test match, largely thanks to a dominant bowling performance by Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets and falling short of the 301-run target. Hazlewood was the key architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs and dismantling the West Indies' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's relentless attack proved too much, allowing them to wrap up the match with two full days to spare.</p>

The move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a significant effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous incentives. Industry unions and workers have applauded the decision, arguing it is a crucial step to reverse job losses and bring production back home.

Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the show was intended to address the "dehumanization of how immigrants are being treated in the United States." The bold presentation was largely praised online as a revolutionary use of fashion to highlight social injustice.</p>
