        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the intensifying supply chain competition between the United States and China is poised to reshape global manufacturing. Eight developing countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Brazil, are expected to benefit from the relocation of manufacturing from China due to lower labor costs and strong trade ties with Western markets. This shift is driven by Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúfriendshoring‚Äù initiative and the ‚ÄúChina+1‚Äù strategy, prompting multinational corporations to diversify production to mitigate tariff exposure. Chinese firms are also exploring lower-cost regions, particularly within the Belt and Road Initiative, potentially establishing these eight economies as critical links in evolving global supply chains.

While facing financial and political hurdles, California's determination to achieve this dream reflects its identity as a land of hope and solutions, with a refusal to succumb to political polarization and entrenched interests.

This season, Emmy contenders are taking it up a notch, using oners for fight scenes, mind warps, documentary-style realism, and examinations of crime and its repercussions. The increasing use of oners also reflects rapid technological transformation, and key to using the oner successfully is ensuring the style doesn‚Äôt outshine the story.</p>
