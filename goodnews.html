          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman has been named the women's coach of the year at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards. This recognition follows her success in guiding the Lionesses to a consecutive European Championship title. Wiegman, a 55-year-old Dutch native, secured the award over other notable coaches, including Chelsea's Sonia Bompastor. England's victory came after a dramatic final against Spain, which was decided by a 3-1 penalty shootout after the match ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned a Trump administration order that halted construction on the Revolution Wind farm, a major offshore project off the New England coast. Danish energy company Orsted announced it will resume work immediately on the nearly completed project, which is expected to power over 350,000 homes. The judge granted a temporary injunction, stating that Orsted would likely suffer irreparable harm if the stop-work order remained. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume its broadcast on ABC this Tuesday, following an indefinite suspension last week. The suspension was enacted after Kimmel made comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's political movement, which drew scrutiny from the FCC. The incident sparked a widespread debate about free speech and potential censorship under the current administration, with many prominent figures rallying in support of Kimmel. The show's return marks a significant development in the ongoing tension between media outlets and political figures.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to avert a U.S. ban on TikTok by moving its American operations into a new U.S.-based joint venture. Under this structure, a majority of investors, owners, and board members would be American, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive security oversight, including for the app's algorithm. The administration expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, which would see parent company ByteDance hold less than 20% equity. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order formalizing the terms later this week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates continue a downward trend, prospective homebuyers waiting for a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in October are advised to take preparatory steps. Financial experts recommend getting pre-approved for a loan after carefully checking one's credit report to ensure it is accurate and favorable. Additionally, researching and selecting a qualified real estate agent can provide a competitive edge in a market that may see increased buyer activity. Comparing lenders and their terms in advance will also position buyers to act quickly and effectively when rates drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is adding Nike to its "Bullpen" watchlist, signaling potential for the sportswear giant as it undergoes a significant turnaround. The company has faced challenges from increased competition and struggles in the Chinese market, which led to a leadership change last year. Under new CEO Elliott Hill, Nike is refocusing on core products, rebuilding retail partnerships, and working to clear excess inventory ahead of the holiday season. Recent analyst upgrades suggest growing confidence that these strategic shifts could lead to renewed growth for the iconic brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer Watchdog, a prominent advocacy group, has proposed a ballot initiative in California called the Insurance Policyholder Bill of Rights. The measure would compel insurers to offer coverage to homeowners who implement wildfire mitigation measures or risk being barred from selling any home or auto insurance in the state for five years. This proposal comes as a response to insurers pulling back from the California market and seeking significant rate increases following recent wildfires. The initiative aims to provide homeowners with more stability and leverage in a volatile insurance landscape.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A $100,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term now carries an average monthly payment of around $1,236, while a 15-year term averages about $974. These costs are marginally lower than they were at the beginning of the year and one year ago. With further rate cuts anticipated, homeowners may see even more favorable borrowing conditions, though the current reduction in cost is not yet substantial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, various predictive maps are forecasting when fall foliage will reach its peak across the United States. These resources estimate that northern regions will see peak colors by early October, with New England and the Pacific Northwest following by mid-October. However, experts caution that these predictions are not exact, as local factors like temperature, rainfall, and elevation significantly impact the timing and vibrancy of the color change. Climate change is generally causing fall foliage to occur later than it has historically, though conditions vary year by year.</p>

          <p>The cost of Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, varies significantly in 2025, with monthly premiums ranging from as low as $32 to over $550. On average, most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans like Part G or Part N. Costs are influenced by factors such as the beneficiary's age, location, tobacco use, and the specific plan chosen. To secure lower premiums, experts advise enrolling when first eligible, comparing quotes from multiple insurers, and considering plans with higher deductibles or cost-sharing.</p>
