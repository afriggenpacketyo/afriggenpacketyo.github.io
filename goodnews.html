          <p>In this guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with zombie fiction, particularly the HBO series "The Last of Us," as a means of distracting herself from real-world anxieties. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional apocalypse provides a temporary escape from the more mundane, yet still troubling, aspects of everyday life. Feintzeig draws a parallel to her experience using horror movies to cope with grief after a miscarriage, noting that confronting fictional horrors can sometimes alleviate the burden of real-life struggles. The author humorously acknowledges the absurdity of her coping mechanism, yet finds solace in the temporary relief it offers.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking ways to disconnect from their smartphones and social media, with a British survey indicating that almost half would prefer a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are not allowed, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies show that excessive smartphone use is associated with mental health problems, prompting some countries to consider measures like mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media use. This trend reflects a broader desire among young people to prioritize real-world connections and reduce their reliance on digital devices.</p>

The renationalization aims to address issues such as frequent cancellations and high ticket prices, with the government planning to reinvest savings into infrastructure improvements.

Researchers found that when owners dwell on work problems after hours, their dogs show more signs of stress, such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," highlights the emotional connection between humans and their pets. The study suggests that employed dog owners may benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of their dogs.</p>

          <p>Japan's government is planning to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions by increasing their annual salaries to over 6 million yen and allowing them to opt for government-covered rented accommodation. The move aims to attract and retain talent amid growing competition as Japanese cuisine gains worldwide popularity. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food. The improved conditions are expected to enhance the chefs' career paths and enable them to more proactively promote Japanese culinary culture.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government aims to improve services and reinvest profits in infrastructure, though lower fares aren't guaranteed. Unions have raised concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on its promises. SWR trains are now the responsibility of DfT Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>
