          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, reached space but lost control during its ninth test flight, experiencing an uncontrolled re-entry. The upper-stage vehicle suffered a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite this setback, the flight achieved improvements over previous tests, including a successful ascent and no significant loss of heat shield tiles during the initial phase. Elon Musk noted the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, though previous schedules have been unrealistic. The mission also flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight in January, important progress toward demonstrating a rocket that can be flown over and over.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket experienced an uncontrolled reentry after mission control lost contact with the upper stage during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The spacecraft leaked fuel, spun out of control, and likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX confirmed that Starship suffered from "a rapid unscheduled disassembly" and attributed the loss of attitude control to a propellant leak or engine failure. The company emphasized that the test provided valuable data for improving Starship's reliability, aiming to make life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing comfort issues related to vibrations at high speeds. A study published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering suggests that minor track imperfections can cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. Researchers say they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more tolerable. The engineers are working at the world‚Äôs first full-scale test line in central China.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, but a propellant leak caused a loss of control, leading to an uncontrolled reentry. The spacecraft was expected to mostly burn up, with remaining pieces falling into the Indian Ocean.

Kennedy Jr. cited a lack of data to support shots for healthy children. While many agree that the original vaccination course offered significant protection against serious illness in children, the need for annual vaccines to protect against new variants is more contentious, with doctors on both sides of the issue.</p>

          <p>The proposed Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters Act (FIRE Act) seeks to create a pathway for former inmate firefighters to secure long-term employment. The act would fund job training, workplace opportunities, and mentoring for former inmate firefighters, and would also offer a path to expunge their criminal records. Incarcerated firefighters make up a significant portion of California's wildfire crews, earning low wages while risking their lives. The act would provide $20 million annually for states to adopt safety and wage compliance, and expand occupational safety coverage for incarcerated firefighters.</p>
