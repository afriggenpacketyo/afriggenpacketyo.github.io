          <p>A tech analyst has described potential government intervention in chipmaker Intel as "essential" for U.S. national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. The move aims to revive the struggling firm and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. Proponents argue that with the rise of superintelligent AI, domestic control over critical chip manufacturing is paramount, comparing it to the necessity of controlling production for the nation's nuclear arsenal. The intervention could be funded through the CHIPS Act, which has already provided billions to Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting self-help book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after its due date in 1943. The book was discovered by a person in Oregon among their late father's belongings and was likely checked out by their grandmother before she moved to Mexico City for work. A letter accompanying the book humorously expressed hope that there would be no late fee. The library, which eliminated late fees in 2021, estimated that the fine would have been almost $900 under the old policy of 3 cents per day.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is developing a compact, American-made electric pickup truck intended to sell for roughly half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy focuses on a simple, barebones base model that owners can customize with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. While the company initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, the rollback of EV incentives may push the price closer to $28,000. This higher price point could challenge its competitiveness against established models like the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Salesforce increased by 4% after a securities filing revealed that activist investor Jeff Smith's Starboard Value had raised its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has led to market speculation that a new round of investor activism is imminent, similar to the successful campaign in late 2022 that pushed the company to focus on profitability and efficiency. Analysts suggest the increased stake signals renewed pressure on Salesforce management to improve growth in its core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions, especially as the stock has underperformed recently amid concerns about its AI strategy.

          <p>A Georgia judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against a protester, Jamie Marsicano, involved in the 'Cop City' demonstrations near Atlanta, citing violations of their constitutional right to a speedy trial. The judge ruled that the state had purposefully delayed issuing an indictment for two and a half years after the arrest, causing "actual prejudice" to the defendant, who has been unable to obtain a law license despite passing the bar exam. This decision marks a significant development in the state's controversial prosecution of opponents of the new police training center, which has included leveling RICO conspiracy charges against dozens of activists.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with maximum sustained winds reaching 75 mph. The storm is currently on a path over the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to pass near the northern Leeward Islands, bringing heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. Forecasters predict Erin will continue to strengthen, potentially becoming a major hurricane of Category 3 or higher early next week. Current forecast models, known as spaghetti maps, show the storm curving northward and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast, though residents in the Caribbean are urged to monitor its progress closely.</p>

          <h2>Research Highlights Health Benefits of Cloves, Including Blood Sugar Regulation</h2>

          <p>The common kitchen spice cloves may offer several health benefits, including promoting gum health and potentially lowering blood sugar levels, according to various research studies. The antibacterial properties of cloves, attributed to a compound called eugenol, can help control plaque and reduce the risk of gum disease. A 2019 study also found that participants who took clove extract daily experienced significantly lower blood sugar after meals. While generally safe in culinary amounts, concentrated clove oil or eugenol can be harmful if consumed in large quantities and can interfere with blood clotting. Cloves are also a rich source of minerals and antioxidants.</p>

          <h2>Horror Film 'Weapons' Praised for Its Cathartic Yet Unsettling Conclusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 14:27:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," written and directed by Zach Cregger, is being hailed for its daring narrative that provides clear answers to its central mystery. The movie follows a community grappling with the inexplicable disappearance of a third-grade class, ultimately revealing a supernatural villain whose defeat provides a moment of cinematic catharsis. However, the review notes that the film cleverly subverts this triumphant feeling by reminding the audience that vanquishing evil does not erase the trauma it caused. By exploring the lingering grief and loss, the film is described as a "feel-bad, feel-good movie" that delivers a satisfying conclusion without offering easy emotional closure.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Reveals Trump's Claims About D.C. Crime are Misleading</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 13:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify a federal takeover of the city's police, finds them to be misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has since dropped significantly in 2024 and 2025. According to the city's police data, violent crime has seen a 26% reduction in the past year, aligning with a broader national trend of decreasing crime rates. The fact check concludes that describing crime as 'out of control' today overstates the current downward trend.</p>
