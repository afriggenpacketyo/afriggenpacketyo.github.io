          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:23:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's injunction that restricts the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive records of the Social Security Administration (SSA). The administration argues that the injunction impedes its ability to modernize government information systems and combat waste and fraud. A federal judge in Maryland imposed the restrictions due to privacy concerns, requiring DOGE team members to undergo training and background checks before accessing unredacted data. The Supreme Court has ordered challengers to respond by May 12, and the case highlights ongoing tensions between government efficiency efforts and individual privacy rights. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has discontinued shipping products directly from China to the United States, opting instead to fulfill U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices and add import charges for U.S. customers buying items from China, and the company is now actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join its platform. The move aims to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses amid changing trade policies. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., scheduled for June 14, which coincides with the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade is expected to include approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing of the parade and White House involvement have raised questions about whether Trump is using the Army's anniversary to stage a military display similar to one he sought during his first term.
