        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has launched worldwide, with stores opening at midnight to accommodate eager fans, though some pre-orders faced cancellation issues. UK retailer Currys reported record-breaking pre-orders, selling 30,000 units, attributing it to the launch's excitement. Despite the initial enthusiasm, questions linger about the Switch 2's ability to match its predecessor's success, particularly due to higher game prices. The new console features a hybrid design, allowing for both handheld and TV play, with enhanced power, storage, and controller innovations.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss trade disputes and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Germany, heavily reliant on exports, is concerned about Trump's trade agenda, including tariffs on autos and steel. Merz is expected to advocate for free trade and a U.S.-EU trade deal, and he will likely reiterate Germany's support for Ukraine and the need for European involvement in peace negotiations. Another key topic will be NATO defense spending, with Merz aiming to demonstrate Germany's commitment to meeting its obligations.</p>

          <p>The government in England will extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 children from September 2026, regardless of their parents' income level if they receive Universal Credit. This change will save parents ¬£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty, according to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative until 2029, and Prime Minister Starmer emphasized that feeding more children is a significant intervention to alleviate poverty and support children's learning. While welcomed by many, some argue that other measures would be more effective at reducing child poverty.</p>
