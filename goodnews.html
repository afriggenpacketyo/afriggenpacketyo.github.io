          <h2>Mark Twain's Uncensored Autobiography Published a Century After His Death</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:47:08 EDT</div>

          <p>A new, extensive autobiography by Mark Twain is being published, precisely 100 years after his death, as per his specific instructions. The work, compiled from years of daily dictations, is unconventional and non-linear, resembling a modern blog where Twain discussed whatever was on his mind. This embargo allowed him to speak freely, offering candid and often harsh opinions on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and unfiltered heartbreak over his daughter's death. Curators at UC Berkeley have spent six years reconstructing the manuscript, which is seen as both a literary event and a brilliant, long-term marketing strategy.</p>

          <p>India is closing in on a victory in the second Test against England, thanks to a remarkable performance by captain Shubman Gill. After scoring 269 in the first innings, Gill added another 161 runs, allowing India to set England a near-impossible target of 608. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the end of day four. India's bowler Akash Deep was instrumental, taking the crucial wickets of Ben Duckett and Joe Root, putting his team in a dominant position to level the series.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain the Science Behind 'Old People Smell'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:28:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon often described as "old people smell" is a real biological process, not just a stigma, according to experts. The distinct musty or greasy scent is largely attributed to the compound 2-nonenal, which is produced as lipids on the skin break down and oxidize with age. This compound is not easily removed by regular washing due to its fatty composition. Experts suggest that managing this age-related odor involves a holistic approach, including an antioxidant-rich diet, proper hydration, and antioxidant skincare, while also noting that sudden changes in body odor could indicate underlying health issues.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, signaling potential progress in negotiations to halt the nearly 21-month war with Israel. While details are still being discussed, the development has sparked optimism, with President Trump suggesting a deal could be reached next week. An Israeli delegation is expected to travel to Qatar for further talks. However, Hamas is reportedly insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the proposed 60-day truce.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix with a last-minute lap, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just 0.103 seconds. The qualifying session at Silverstone was intensely competitive, with McLaren's Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell fourth, all within a tight margin. Lewis Hamilton, who had been quick earlier, slipped to fifth. Verstappen noted the windy conditions made the high-speed corners challenging, but his final lap was enough to secure the top spot for the race.</p>

          <h2>AI Chatbot Explains How Billionaires Use 'Buy-Borrow-Die' Strategy to Minimize Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 13:01:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry with ChatGPT about billionaire tax fairness revealed that the core issue is not tax rates but how different income types are treated. The AI explained the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where wealthy individuals borrow against their appreciating assets like stocks to fund their lifestyle, as loans are not taxed as income. This allows them to avoid capital gains taxes that would be due if they sold the assets. Upon death, these assets can be passed to heirs with a stepped-up basis, largely erasing the tax liability, highlighting how the current system taxes labor more heavily than wealth.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems has led to "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in more situations and at higher suggested percentages, causing confusion and frustration. Marketing professors explain that point-of-sale devices often default to showing tip screens with pre-calculated options of 15-25%, pressuring customers to tip even in counter-service or takeaway settings. While this can increase income for service workers, it also creates social pressure and guilt, potentially leaving a negative impression on customers. The shift away from cash has made these digital tip requests more common and harder to avoid.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, has been rediscovered, exciting scholars in the U.S., Taiwan, and China. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a critical step in adapting the complex, non-alphabetic Chinese language for modern technology. The typewriter's ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed on computers today. The machine, found in a New York basement, has been acquired by Stanford University for restoration and display.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Parisians are officially permitted to swim in designated areas of the Seine River, a milestone celebrated by many. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, initiated in conjunction with the previous year's Olympics, which has successfully improved water quality to meet European standards. On Saturday, Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined residents for a dip near the Eiffel Tower, marking the realization of a long-held dream to restore the iconic waterway for public recreation.
