        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is defending his proposal to establish five city-operated grocery stores, suggesting a potential "partnership" with existing private store owners. The plan, central to his campaign's focus on affordability, aims to lower food prices by operating non-profit stores that would buy and sell at wholesale rates. While Mamdani frames it as a way to increase competitiveness and provide a public option for fresh produce, the proposal has drawn significant criticism from current grocery chain owners and economists. They warn that such a move could destabilize the market and harm the family-owned businesses that form a critical part of the city's communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major metropolitan areas, smaller county-level cities are becoming a significant engine for national consumption. Residents in these lower-tier markets are reportedly experiencing faster income growth and have lighter economic burdens, leading to increased purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend on premium goods. This shift is fueling a new wave of consumption, with experts noting that the potential of these areas has been previously overlooked. The trend is seen as crucial for China's goal of transitioning its economy toward a model driven more by domestic consumption rather than relying heavily on exports and investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at schools and universities nationwide. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions that continued DEI initiatives, stating the guidance created a "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedure. The judge, a Trump appointee, ordered the department to scrap the guidance. This decision is being hailed as a significant victory by educational groups who argued the administration's policies constituted illegal government censorship and chilled constitutionally protected speech in classrooms.</p>

          <p>Despite a rocky consumer rollout that led OpenAI to restore its previous model for paying chatbot users, the new GPT-5 is rapidly gaining traction in the more lucrative enterprise sector. Businesses and startups report that the new model is faster, cheaper, and more effective at complex tasks like coding and reasoning compared to its predecessor and competitors like Anthropic's Claude. This strategic pivot highlights OpenAI's focus on securing the enterprise market, where it has built a substantial sales team to compete directly for major corporate clients. The move is part of a high-stakes battle for dominance in the AI industry, with companies spending heavily to lock in customers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reversed its decision to use expedited removal proceedings against a woman who has lived in the United States for nearly three decades. After her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the move was illegal, the government agreed to place Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul into regular deportation proceedings, which allows her the right to a hearing before an immigration judge. The case drew attention to concerns that the Trump administration is unlawfully expanding the use of fast-track deportations, a process legally reserved for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years. Co Tupul remains in detention pending her court hearing.</p>

          <p>In a recorded message to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, King Charles paid tribute to the soldiers whose service and sacrifice brought an end to World War II. The King vowed that those who fought and died in the Pacific and Far East campaigns "shall never be forgotten." The commemoration, which marks Japan's surrender to Allied forces on August 15, 1945, will include a service of remembrance attended by the King, Queen, and Prime Minister. An estimated 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers died in the war against Japan, and the King's message emphasized the immense cost of the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen nearly 50% this year amid public backlash over rising healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. The move reflects Buffett's classic value investing strategy of buying into fundamentally strong companies during periods of market difficulty. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock rose 6% in extended trading, signaling investor confidence from Berkshire's endorsement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a meteoric rise since its 2020 public listing, with its stock surging over 1,700% and its market valuation exceeding $430 billion. This valuation places it among the most valuable U.S. tech firms, despite having a fraction of the revenue of its megacap peers. A key driver of this growth has been its lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's focus on artificial intelligence has attracted significant retail investor interest, contributing to a stock price that trades at a steep premium relative to its earnings.

Rees-Zammit expressed excitement about returning to a game where he can create exciting moments for fans. His return is a significant boost for Bristol and a notable event for international rugby.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive and earlier approach to treatment. Under the new advice, individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should be prescribed medication if lifestyle changes alone do not lower it within three to six months. In a notable shift, the guidelines now recommend abstaining from alcohol entirely, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. These updates reflect an increased focus on proactive measures to prevent heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia, which are all linked to hypertension.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans have continued their recent downward trend, according to a new report from Bankrate. The median rate for a HELOC fell slightly to 8.12%, while the average home equity loan rate decreased to 8.23%. This modest decline keeps these borrowing options attractive for homeowners looking to tap into record-high levels of home equity. For those with variable-rate HELOCs, any future cuts to the federal funds rate could lead to further reductions in their payments, while those considering a fixed-rate home equity loan may weigh whether to apply now or wait for potentially lower rates.

          <p>Intel's stock price climbed 7% following a report that the Trump administration is considering taking a direct stake in the semiconductor company. This potential investment would help fund the construction of new chip manufacturing factories in Ohio, aligning with the administration's goal of increasing domestic production of high-tech components. Intel is the only U.S.-based company capable of manufacturing the most advanced chips on American soil. The move would represent another instance of the U.S. government taking a more direct role in key industries to advance national and economic security interests, following similar actions with other technology and materials companies.
