        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to launch a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will cut energy costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms starting in 2027, and an increase to a 90% discount on network charges from 2026 for the most energy-intensive firms. Other measures in the strategy involve upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending, with a focus on eight specific sectors. While some business groups and unions welcome the plan, others express disappointment over the exclusion of sectors like retail and leisure. Optimism surrounding the plan is tempered by recent figures showing a contraction in the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column explores the ethical dilemmas faced by educators regarding the use of AI in humanities education. The author argues that the true value of humanities lies in the formation of human character, rather than simply producing academic outputs. With AI threatening to remove cognitive friction from learning, the author suggests incorporating reflection pieces alongside AI-assisted assignments to encourage critical thinking. The goal is to help students develop practical wisdom, enabling them to make informed choices about technology's role in their lives. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the internal contradictions within Donald Trump's political coalition, particularly regarding foreign policy and immigration. The author notes tensions between non-interventionist supporters and those who favor a more hawkish approach, especially concerning Israel and Iran. Conflicts also arise over immigration policies, with business interests clashing with hardline stances. Despite these disagreements, the author argues that the Trump voter base remains primarily loyal to Trump himself, rather than any coherent ideology. </p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that almost two-thirds of Germans favor a European nuclear deterrent independent of the United States. The survey, conducted by the Forsa institute, found widespread support for the concept across demographic and political lines. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled his intent to pursue discussions with the UK and France on developing a joint European nuclear strategy. The goal is to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, especially amid concerns over the unpredictability of President Donald Trump. </p>
