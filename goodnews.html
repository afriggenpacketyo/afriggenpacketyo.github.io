          <h2>Supreme Court Sides Against Trump Administration in Alien Enemies Act Case</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals, citing insufficient time and resources for detainees to challenge their deportations. The court barred the removal of the men, alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang, pending a new decision from a lower federal appellate court, but noted the government could pursue removal under other lawful authorities. President Trump criticized the ruling, while dissenting Justices Alito and Thomas questioned the detainees' imminent danger of removal. The case returns to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to determine the extent of notice required for those targeted for removal under the AEA.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker missing for weeks in the Sierra Nevada mountains, recounted her survival story at a news conference, detailing how she was trapped by an avalanche and later immobilized by a fall. Unable to call 911, she followed her GPS towards a Starbucks, facing a difficult journey. After running out of food, Slaton, a nutritionist, survived by foraging for wild leeks, boiling snowmelt, and making tea from manzanita and pine needles. She was eventually found in a cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, narrowly escaping death due to heavy snowstorms.</p>

          <p>Brock Purdy, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, has reportedly agreed to a five-year, $265 million contract extension with $181 million guaranteed. Purdy, known as "Mr. Irrelevant" after being the final pick in the 2022 NFL draft, quickly exceeded expectations by leading the 49ers to consecutive playoff appearances and a Super Bowl trip in 2024. Despite an injury-riddled 2024 season, Purdy's strong performance earned him a place among the league's highest-paid quarterbacks. Purdy expressed his commitment to San Francisco and his determination to lead the team to success.</p>

          <p>A CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The research, one of the last from the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs, found that in 2022, 51 drowning deaths could have been prevented with adequate pool fencing, and 297 with life jackets during boating accidents. The study also estimated the economic cost of these preventable deaths to be $4.5 billion. The CDC did not comment, but the study highlights the importance of these safety measures.</p>

          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation reveals that Kroger shoppers are being overcharged due to price tag errors on items marked as on sale or discounted.
