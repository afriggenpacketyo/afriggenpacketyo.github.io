          <p>Longtime Trump administration insider May Davis Mailman has departed her role as deputy assistant to the president, marking a significant staff change in the second term. While she is the highest-ranking official to leave without being forced out, she will temporarily remain a special government employee to conclude her policy work. Sources indicate Mailman plans to start her own government affairs firm, maintaining her connections within Washington's political sphere. Her departure is noted as a loss of a seasoned hand for the administration's inner workings.</p>

          <p>NORAD fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated the temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, retreat. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted airspace. This was one of five such unauthorized incursions over the weekend, prompting officials to remind general aviation pilots to check all FAA notices before flying. NORAD emphasized that the flares are used with the highest regard for safety and pose no danger to people on the ground.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated Genie 2, an advanced AI model that can generate playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image. Researchers showed how a photograph of a waterfall could be transformed into a game-like world that an AI agent or human could explore on the fly. CEO Demis Hassabis explained that beyond entertainment, the technology serves a larger goal of building a "world model" that understands our physical reality. These simulated worlds could be used to train AI agents and robots for complex tasks more efficiently and safely than in the real world.</p>

          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly growing in popularity, with many women viewing it as a revolutionary way to manage their biological clocks and delay motherhood. A recent report highlights that women are increasingly choosing the procedure to focus on careers or find the right partner without the pressure of declining fertility. However, the process is expensive, often costing over $12,000 per cycle, and does not guarantee a future pregnancy. Bioethicists caution that it presents a gamble and raises concerns about equitable access and the societal pressures that push women to delay childbirth.</p>

          <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, believes artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress and could achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within a decade. In a recent interview, he predicted that AI could revolutionize human health, potentially curing all diseases, and lead to an era of "radical abundance" by eliminating scarcity. Hassabis also showcased Astra, an AI assistant that can see, hear, and reason about the world in real-time. While optimistic, he acknowledged the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of keeping powerful AI systems aligned with human values.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake occurred about 10 kilometers below the surface, causing brief shaking but no significant damage or injuries. The event startled residents, with some reporting a loud boom and feeling as if a car had hit their house. This tremor follows a much larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, though rare, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787 was ascending when the crew reported the failure of the left engine to air traffic control. The aircraft safely returned to Dulles, where it was met by emergency personnel. All 219 passengers and 11 crew members deplaned without injury. The airline confirmed a mechanical issue caused the diversion and arranged alternate travel for the affected customers.</p>

          <p>Russia's Krasheninnikov volcano has erupted for the first time in centuries, sending an ash plume miles into the sky and prompting an aviation alert. The eruption on the Kamchatka Peninsula occurred just days after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake shook the region. Seismologists suggest the quake may have acted as a trigger for the volcano, which was likely already near an eruptive state. The area is sparsely populated, and officials have stated there is currently no threat to local inhabitants, though the volcanic activity is being closely monitored.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office, earning $40 million in its second weekend.

Following behind were the debut of the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" with $22.2 million and the new "The Naked Gun" movie with $17 million, indicating a varied but somewhat slow start to the August box office season.</p>

          <p>Recent comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company's acquisition strategy have fueled speculation that Apple may be looking to acquire Perplexity, a rapidly growing AI search chatbot. Perplexity, valued at around $18 billion, offers a user-focused experience with real-time, direct answers that could align well with Apple's design philosophy. Such a deal would instantly provide Apple with an established AI model and monetization strategy, accelerating its roadmap in the competitive artificial intelligence space. The move would represent a significant departure from Apple's usual strategy of smaller, bolt-on acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

However, future growth faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>
