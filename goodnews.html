        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A White House meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy focused on pathways to a peace deal with Russia. Key topics included the potential for a trilateral summit with Vladimir Putin and the provision of U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine. The meeting, which was also attended by seven European leaders, was notably more cordial than a previous encounter. However, Trump signaled a shift away from demanding an immediate ceasefire, a position that created some tension with the European contingent who view it as a crucial first step for negotiations.</p>

          <p>Leeds secured a 1-0 victory against Everton in their Premier League return, thanks to a contentious penalty decision that has sparked debate over handball rules. Everton defender James Tarkowski was penalized for blocking a shot with his arm, which was positioned close to his body, leading to the decisive spot-kick. Pundits and players were divided on the call, highlighting ongoing confusion about the rule regarding a player making their body "unnaturally bigger." The incident underscores the persistent refereeing controversies that continue to influence match outcomes in the league.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the controversy over China's plan to build a large new embassy at the historic former Royal Mint site in London is a reflection of broader UK-China relations. The author contends that the sheer scale of the proposed diplomatic hub is a powerful statement of China's rising status as a global superpower and its long-term commitment to its relationship with the UK. The piece contrasts this with what it describes as Britain's short-term financial approach of selling off prime diplomatic properties, suggesting the UK could benefit from embracing China's significant investment.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with further negotiations on a permanent ceasefire to follow. Israel's official response remains unclear, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously insisted on the release of all hostages at once. The development comes amid intensified Israeli military operations in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>As "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services grow in popularity, so do defaults, raising questions about debt relief options. The article explains that because BNPL plans are a form of unsecured debt, they can potentially be included in debt forgiveness programs, similar to credit card debt. However, eligibility can vary, as some BNPL providers may not negotiate settlements and instead send delinquent accounts directly to collectors. For consumers struggling with BNPL debt, other strategies like direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling may also be effective alternatives.

          <p>This analysis piece observes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a more cautious and collegial approach during his recent White House meeting with President Trump, a stark contrast to their acrimonious encounter in February. Joined by several European leaders who seemed to be running interference, Zelenskyy largely avoided confrontation while Trump boasted of his peacemaking abilities. While few concrete details of a peace plan emerged, the meeting was notable for its lack of overt conflict, suggesting all sides were keen to project a unified front and shift the onus for peace back onto Russia.</p>
