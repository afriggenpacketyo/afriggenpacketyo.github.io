          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab surged 8% on Monday, extending a significant rally that has seen the stock nearly double in the past two months. The company's market value has now exceeded $19 billion, driven by a series of successful launches and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. In June alone, Rocket Lab successfully completed three launches of its Electron rocket, demonstrating its capability to deploy rockets from the same site within 48 hours. The company is a key player in the increasingly competitive commercial space industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent news segment highlighted several uplifting stories, including that of Jessica Caldwell, a Texas custodian and mother of four who earned four college degrees while working full-time overnight. For over a decade, she cleaned the very classrooms at A&M Central Texas University where she attended classes during the day. Another featured story was about postal worker Ian Burke, who adopted a dog named Pretty Boy Floyd from his former mail route. After learning the dog's elderly owner had passed away and the pup was at a shelter, Burke rushed to adopt his old friend.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have expressed gratitude for the newly announced US-backed plan to supply more weapons, viewing it as a crucial step in defending against Russian aggression. President Zelenskyy highlighted the development, which comes after months of intense aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities. In contrast, officials and commentators in Moscow have largely dismissed President Trump's 50-day ultimatum and threat of secondary tariffs as "hot air." This mixed international reaction underscores the uncertainty of whether the new measures will successfully pressure Russia to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

          <p>England cricket captain Ben Stokes described his bowling effort in the team's dramatic 22-run Test victory over India at Lord's as one of the toughest of his career. Stokes, who was named player of the match, bowled two long and relentless spells on the final day to help secure the win, despite recently returning from surgery. He stated that with the Test match on the line, he wouldn't even think about stopping, pushing himself to a "whole new level of tiredness." The victory gives England a 2-1 lead in the heated series with two matches remaining.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 as part of a significant crackdown on spam and inauthentic content. The initiative targets accounts that impersonate large creators and use AI tools to mass-produce low-quality posts, often referred to as "AI slop." In addition to the profile removals, Meta took action against 500,000 accounts for inauthentic behavior by demoting their content. The company is also implementing stricter measures to promote original creator content, reflecting a broader industry effort to combat the rising tide of spam on social media platforms.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:20:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the "age 75 rule," a common belief suggesting that retirees should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to receive higher payouts. The rule is based on the fact that insurers offer larger payments to older individuals due to shorter life expectancies. However, the article cautions that this is an oversimplification, as waiting may not be optimal for everyone. Factors such as needing income earlier, protecting against longevity risk, and potential changes in health could make purchasing an annuity at a younger age a more prudent financial decision for securing guaranteed retirement income.

O'Neal, who was ranked sixth on the list, commented on social media that placing Bryant outside the top 10 is "criminal." This is consistent with O'Neal's long-held view that Bryant is one of the greatest players ever, often including him on his personal all-time starting five. The two superstars, who won three championships together with the Lakers, had a famously complex relationship but maintained a deep mutual respect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue color additive for food and beverages that is derived from the fruit of the gardenia plant. The additive, called gardenia blue, is approved for use in products like sports drinks, candy, and ready-to-drink teas. This marks the fourth naturally sourced color approved by the FDA in the last two months, aligning with a broader push by the administration to replace petroleum-based synthetic dyes with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply. The new dye is created by refining a compound from crushed gardenia fruit, which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
