          <p>South Korea is holding a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979. The case re-examines whether his act was treasonous insurrection or a patriotic move to restore democracy, a question that has polarized the nation for decades. Kim's family argues he was tortured into a false confession and that his trial was politically motivated by the subsequent military regime. This retrial occurs amid contemporary concerns about South Korean democracy, potentially influencing how history judges a man who killed a dictator to prevent further bloodshed.</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time in history. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs to clinch the victory for the NL, earning him the MVP award despite going hitless during regulation play. The new tie-breaking format, introduced in 2022, was implemented to prevent games from running long and depleting pitching staffs. The event also featured the first use of the robot umpire challenge system in an All-Star Game.</p>

          <p>Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 24% in June compared to the previous year, with China and Europe driving the growth. A report from Rho Motion indicates that 1.8 million units were sold worldwide, with China accounting for 60% of the total after a 28% jump in its domestic market. In contrast, sales in North America experienced a 9% decline, positioning the U.S. market as a laggard in the global transition to electric mobility. For the first half of 2025, global EV sales are up 28% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows a House subcommittee's advancement of the SCORE Act, which aims to create a federal framework for athlete compensation, superseding varied state laws. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have dramatically reshaped college athletics by allowing student-athletes to earn millions from endorsements and other deals. The executive order signals the White House's direct engagement in the contentious debate over the regulation and future of collegiate sports.</p>

Responding to a troll on social media, Knox explained the coercive context of the diary entry and pushed back against the shame she was made to feel after being vilified by the media.
