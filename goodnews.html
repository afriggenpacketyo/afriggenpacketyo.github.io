          <p>A rare June heatwave is affecting tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, with dangerously high temperatures and heat indices. Numerous heat advisories have been issued, and forecasts predict heat indices exceeding 100F in many areas. Cities are taking measures to provide relief to residents, such as opening cooling centers and offering guidance on staying safe. The extreme heat has also impacted sporting events and outdoor activities. Meteorologists attribute the heatwave to a heat dome, a phenomenon trapping heat and humidity.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough for England after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test against India at Headingley. India was building their lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2. Brook, who was dropped twice, played aggressively before being caught out. England was eventually bowled out for 465, giving India a narrow first-innings lead. The match is finely balanced as play ended due to drizzle and poor light.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a diplomatic challenge following the US airstrikes on Iran, despite his calls for de-escalation. While avoiding direct UK involvement, Starmer has sought to maintain a solid relationship with President Trump. The UK was given advanced warning of the US action but was not asked to participate. The legality of any UK involvement had been debated, and the US may request military support in the future. The situation requires Starmer to balance supporting the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons program with concerns about the method and potential consequences.</p>
