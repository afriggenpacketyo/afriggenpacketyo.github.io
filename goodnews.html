        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer presents a bullish outlook on the U.S. stock market, arguing that ten key factors will continue to support its growth despite looming tariff deadlines. He points to strong corporate earnings, the economic stimulus from the "One Big Beautiful Bill" tax cuts, and massive investment in data centers and the energy sector as powerful drivers. Cramer dismisses concerns that tariffs will derail highly valued stocks, suggesting the current economic environment is more robust than many commentators believe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ has forecasted that quantum computing will cross the threshold of practical 'usefulness' within the next five years, marking a significant milestone for the technology. The company's founder compared the current state of the industry to the pivotal moment when semiconductors began replacing vacuum tubes in the 1950s. SpinQ, which produces both educational and industrial-grade quantum computers, anticipates this advancement will unlock broad, real-world applications for the powerful technology.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open with a commanding performance at Royal Portrush, marking his fourth major title and solidifying his status as the world's number one golfer. His consistent, machine-like play throughout the tournament drew widespread comparisons from peers and analysts to the peak dominance of Tiger Woods. This victory is his 11th on the PGA tour since early 2024 and leaves him only a U.S. Open win away from completing the coveted career Grand Slam.</p>

The article argues that by validating feelings instead of dismissing them, parents can build a child's emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This approach helps protect against anxiety and self-doubt by teaching children to trust their inner voice, which can be fostered through small but significant shifts in parental communication.</p>
