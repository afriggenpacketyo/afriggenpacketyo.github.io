          <p>Fan Daidi, a chemistry professor turned entrepreneur, exemplifies China's booming chemical sciences sector by commercializing innovations in collagen synthesis. As dean of Northwest University's chemical engineering school, Fan's skincare enterprise Giant Biogene has reached a $10.4 billion valuation. Her rise highlights how state-backed scientific industrialization is creating a new generation of academic tycoons. Fan and her husband Yan Jianya's combined holdings are estimated to be valued at over 40 billion yuan, with ownership in Giant Biogene and XiAn Triangle Defence, operating in pharmaceuticals and aerospace. </p>

          <p>The Mayo Clinic is using a fecal waste biobank to personalize medicine by understanding how the microbiome affects cancer patients' responses to medications. Researchers aim to identify which drugs patients are most likely to respond to by analyzing their microbiome and genes, moving away from the current regimen-based approach. This research involves a biobank of over 2,000 stool samples, with the expectation of publishing results this summer. The work is part of a broader effort to understand how the gut microbiome influences cancer treatment outcomes, with researchers experimenting with fecal transplants and other methods. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The UK already has similar reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia. The proposed scheme is facing criticism, with some describing it as "free movement through the back door," but Starmer insists it is not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. The UK is considering this scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU, with issues such as fishing rights also expected to be discussed. </p>

          <p>A DW Fact Check article examines the trustworthiness of using AI chatbots for fact-checking, highlighting instances where AI responses are unreliable. Studies from the BBC and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism reveal that AI tools often provide inaccurate news, alter quotes, and fabricate links. The article notes that AI chatbots are only as good as the data they are trained on, which can be influenced by disinformation and political control. Experts advise users to double-check AI-generated information with other sources, emphasizing that AI systems should not be seen as definitive fact-checking tools. </p>

          <p>A recent report identifies 13 careers that offer good pay, long-term stability, and are unlikely to be replaced by AI, requiring only a high school diploma. These jobs, paying at least $50,000 a year, require significant human interaction, manual dexterity, or creativity. Examples include forest fire inspectors, flight attendants, and lodging managers. These careers offer stability due to their reliance on human skills that AI cannot easily replicate. </p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate, is gaining traction among young, online influencers in New York City, raising questions about the power of social media clout in local elections. These influencers, typically known for shaping cultural trends, are using their platforms to support Mamdani's campaign, drawn to his progressive policies on rent and transportation. While former Governor Andrew Cuomo remains the frontrunner, Mamdani's rise is attributed to his savvy use of social media and the backing of a hip social media class. It remains to be seen whether this type of influence can translate into votes in the mayoral election. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring policy changes to expand insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.), including for military members and those insured through the Affordable Care Act. Aides are discussing making I.V.F. an "Essential Health Benefit" and pushing Congress to require private insurance companies to cover the procedure. While the White House has engaged with various stakeholders, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine reports that it has been excluded from the process. The administration's goal is complicated by conflicting views within Trump's base, as some conservatives oppose I.V.F. due to concerns about embryo loss. </p>
