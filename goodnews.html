        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government, under President Trump, facilitated a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, aiming to end the conflict in eastern DRC over mineral wealth. The deal, initialed by officials and set to be signed in Washington, seeks to bring American investment into the region, rich in minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. Critics are skeptical of the agreement's success, as the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, was not a signatory. The agreement's success hinges on M23's compliance and Rwanda's willingness to withdraw support, potentially transforming the geopolitical landscape of African crisis resolution and countering China's dominance in the DRC's mineral sector. The deal is expected to be finalized in Washington.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026 to reduce environmental harm, making it the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The motion passed in the Senedd includes an exemption for medical-grade wipes and does not extend to business-to-business supply. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the need to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products, noting the tangible and long-lasting impact of wet wipe pollution. Research from Cardiff University revealed that significant quantities of wet wipes enter Welsh river systems annually, highlighting the importance of preventing improper disposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for a further 90 days, marking the third such delay. The video-sharing app's future has been uncertain since the US passed a law requiring its ban unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order to delay the law's enforcement, prompting a statement from TikTok expressing gratitude for his support in keeping the app available for its US users. The extension provides additional time for negotiations regarding the app's ownership and operation.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a retrial that concluded with a jury verdict on Wednesday.

The case involved conflicting evidence, including the circumstances surrounding O'Keefe's death outside a Canton home and questions about the investigation's integrity. The trial garnered significant attention due to the complex nature of the evidence and allegations of misconduct.</p>

          <p>Spain is opposing NATO's plans to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP), arguing that it is unreasonable and counterproductive. Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez informed NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte of his country's opposition in a letter, stating that Madrid would not commit to a specific spending target at the upcoming NATO summit. Spain's government believes that the existing NATO target of 2% of GDP is realistic, and that the process should involve determining capabilities before setting a percentage. Spain's military expenditure is around 1.3% of GDP, but the government plans to achieve the 2% target this year by spending an additional ‚Ç¨10.5 billion.</p>

          <p>In an era marked by heightened polarization and easy offense, learning to be less offended can improve one's quality of life. Understanding the psychology behind taking offense, which involves identifying insults, assessing their severity, and responding emotionally, is the first step toward controlling reactions. Strategies to achieve this include laughing off minor offenses, using the prefrontal cortex to manage emotions, and tuning out offense-making media. Ultimately, managing one's own reactions to offense can lead to greater self-control and a more positive outlook.</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, is a common offering at spirit houses in Thai Town, Los Angeles, replacing blood sacrifices from the past. These small shrines honor spirits and provide them with a place to dwell, with the red soda believed to appeal to spirits' sweet tooth. Some believe it is specifically for the Kuman Thong, the spirit of a boy who can grant wishes. While the exact reason for Fanta's popularity is unclear, it is likely due to the brand's long-standing presence in Thailand and the drink's vibrant symbolic color, with the act of offering serving as a moment for reflection and prayer.</p>
