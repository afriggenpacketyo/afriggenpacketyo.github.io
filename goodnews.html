          <p>Cliff Asness's quantitative investment firm, AQR Capital Management, has reported significant gains across several of its hedge funds for the first half of 2025. The firm's Apex and Delphi funds, which utilize a mix of stock, macro, and arbitrage strategies, both posted double-digit returns, outperforming the S&P 500's 5.3% year-to-date increase. This performance comes amid a volatile market that has seen a strong rebound from an earlier sell-off.

          <p>A business school professor and CEO suggests that job seekers should ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" to uncover a company's true values during an interview. This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers than direct inquiries about company culture, revealing practical realities about work-life balance, collaboration, and workplace environment. The article advises saving this disarming question for the end of the interview process, once rapport has been established. The goal is to help individuals find a job that aligns with their personal values, which is crucial for long-term career satisfaction and success.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970s environmental law. Governor Gavin Newsom and other state leaders argue the changes are necessary to streamline development and address the state's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis. The reform aims to remove bureaucratic hurdles that have historically slowed down or prevented the construction of new housing projects. This legislative change was pushed through despite opposition from some environmental groups, marking a major shift in the state's approach to balancing environmental protection with urgent housing needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have decreased, homeowners have an attractive option for borrowing, but there are potential pitfalls to avoid. Experts advise against overborrowing just because rates are lower than alternatives like personal loans, as the home serves as collateral. Homeowners should also actively monitor the rate climate rather than assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions. Finally, it is recommended to use HELOCs for strategic purposes, such as value-adding home renovations or as an emergency fund, rather than for discretionary spending like vacations.

Instead, savers should actively shop around, particularly at online banks, which often offer more competitive rates. With further Fed rate cuts anticipated, considering a long-term CD now could be a strategic move to lock in current rates for several years, ensuring a stable return on savings.

The study's authors theorize that the link between dairy and bad dreams may be related to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep.

Many nonprofit hospitals are required by law to offer charity care, providing free or discounted services to patients who meet specific income criteria, typically based on the federal poverty level. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances with creditors, though this can impact credit scores. As a last resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure medical debt, but it has severe long-term financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>
