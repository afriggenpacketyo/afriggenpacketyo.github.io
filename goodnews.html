        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scottie Scheffler has established a commanding four-shot lead at The Open Championship, making his victory seem almost certain heading into the final round. His performance is described as relentless and unflappable, drawing comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods, with bookmakers giving him extremely short odds to win. Having won on the last nine occasions he held a 54-hole lead, his consistent and simple approach to the game leaves competitors with little hope. This potential victory would mark his fourth major title and move him three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:41:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is pivoting its security policy towards closer cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new trilateral alliance known as the "E3." This shift, marked by a comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK could supplement, or even one day replace, the US security guarantee for Europe. This strategic realignment aims to bolster European defense independence, though officials acknowledge that full independence from the US is not yet realistic.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler holds a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round of The Open at Royal Portrush. After a solid, bogey-free third round of 67, he sits at 14 under par, with China's Li Haotong as his closest challenger. Scheffler has a perfect record of converting 54-hole leads into victories, making him the strong favorite to secure the third leg of the career Grand Slam. Despite a spirited charge from Rory McIlroy, who is six shots back, Scheffler's consistent and error-free play has kept the competition at bay.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a loan move to Barcelona after falling out of favor at Old Trafford under manager Ruben Amorim. Despite a lackluster period at United and an inconsistent loan spell at Aston Villa, Barcelona sees potential in the 27-year-old to strengthen their forward line. The deal is financially attractive for the Spanish club, as an initial loan with an option to buy presents a low-risk opportunity to acquire a player with vast top-level experience. For Manchester United, the move represents an effort to offload an unwanted player and reshape the squad.</p>

His performance was seen as a defiant response to recent criticism about his form, showcasing his value as a big-game player. The back-row, including Tadhg Beirne and Jack Conan, was instrumental in establishing the Lions' physical dominance over Australia.</p>

          <p>A feature in The Guardian explores the work of Generation Life, a group of Gen Z activists who advocate for chastity before marriage. The article follows them as they engage with young people at the Jersey shore, a location known for its party culture. Rather than focusing solely on abstinence, the group defines chastity as seeing a person's full worth and resisting the objectification prevalent on social media. This countercultural message aims to resonate with a generation that is famously risk-averse and feels the negative mental health impacts of online life, reframing caution as a celebrated virtue.</p>

After quitting her job in 2020, she embarked on an overlanding adventure along the Pan-American highway, spending approximately $1,305 per month on expenses like gas and food. Kaye invested over $50,000 to renovate the truck with a camper, solar power, and other amenities for self-reliant travel. While she enjoys the freedom of setting her own pace, she acknowledges the logistical challenges of crossing borders and the constant work of setting up and breaking down her mobile home.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise much faster than initially expected. While the injury was projected to sideline him for six weeks, Muncy is already running and performing agility drills just two weeks after the incident. Doctors told him he was a "millisecond" away from a much more severe, surgery-requiring injury. His accelerated recovery is welcome news for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly in his absence, highlighting his importance to the team's lineup and overall performance.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships has finally been presented with their gold medals, 28 years after the event. The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified. The disqualification occurred after American runner Antonio Pettigrew confessed in 2008 to doping during that period. The belated ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the athletes received a warm reception from the home crowd.</p>
