        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, is a crucial tool for millions of American retirees to cover out-of-pocket costs not handled by Original Medicare. The average monthly premiums for these plans in 2025 can vary widely, typically ranging from $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive coverage. Most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month, with costs depending heavily on location, age, gender, and the specific plan chosen. To lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible, comparing plans carefully, and considering options with higher deductibles or fewer benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted an injunction allowing the Danish renewable energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. The Trump administration's Interior Department had issued a stop-work order for the nearly completed project, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted argued the order was arbitrary and issued in bad faith, a position the court appeared to support with its ruling. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry in the United States.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and OpenAI have announced a major partnership in which the chipmaker will invest up to $100 billion into the AI research lab. The investment is aimed at building a massive network of data centers, powered by Nvidia's processors, that will require 10 gigawatts of power. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the project as "monumental," noting it represents a significant expansion of AI computing capacity. The collaboration solidifies the symbiotic relationship between the two companies, which have been central to the recent AI boom, and sent Nvidia's stock soaring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial, which had previously unseated Bud Light. The shift marks a significant comeback for parent company AB InBev after Bud Light faced a conservative backlash two years ago. Modelo's decline is attributed to several factors, including tariffs and reduced spending among its core Hispanic consumer base, which parent company Constellation Brands noted has been impacted by the current economic climate. This change in market leadership reflects evolving consumer preferences and ongoing economic pressures affecting major brewers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran argued that the central bank's key interest rate is excessively high and should be cut by nearly two percentage points. Miran contends that policy changes from the White House, including deregulation and shifts in immigration and tax policy, have lowered the neutral interest rate, making current monetary policy overly restrictive. His stance places him in dissent with the Federal Open Market Committee's more cautious approach, as he believes maintaining high rates risks unnecessary job losses and harms the Fed's employment mandate.

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,700 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The precious metal has gained over 40% this year, driven by central bank purchases and geopolitical instability. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for investors to gain exposure to gold is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track its price, rather than owning physical bullion. Despite the rally, advisors generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion, typically under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that chronic insomnia may be a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, finding it was associated with a 40% higher risk of cognitive impairment. However, the research also offered positive news, indicating that individuals who successfully treated their insomnia or improved their sleep habits did not exhibit the same elevated risk. The findings underscore the importance of addressing sleep problems as a preventative health measure. Experts recommend strategies such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, practicing relaxation techniques like meditation, and limiting caffeine and alcohol intake to improve sleep quality.</p>

Emil's journey covered nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, with his movements tracked by thousands of followers online.
