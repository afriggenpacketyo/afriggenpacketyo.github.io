        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is expanding the Warm Home Discount program, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to millions more households. The changes remove property size and energy score qualifications, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million with children. Energy companies will fund the expansion, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers through the Standing Charge. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk, including those on non-means tested benefits.</p>

          <p>Karen Read has been found not guilty of second-degree murder in the retrial concerning the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in 2022. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of the collision, but convicted her of operating under the influence of liquor. The judge immediately sentenced her to one-year probation, which is standard for a first-time offense. Read's first trial ended in a mistrial in July 2024 after the jury could not reach a verdict, and she has maintained her innocence throughout the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, maintaining a "wait-and-see" approach as it evaluates the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and continued economic growth but acknowledged uncertainty due to the Trump administration's new tariffs, which are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth. The central bank will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in her retrial for the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe. She was acquitted of the most serious charges, including second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene after an accident resulting in death. The jury did find her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, and the judge sentenced her to one-year probation. The defense argued that Read's vehicle did not hit O'Keefe and instead said O'Keefe was attacked by a dog and beaten by other people who were in the house before he was thrown out in the snow to die.</p>

These titles include iconic movies like "Star Wars," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," "Jurassic Park," and various superhero films. Collectively, these summer blockbusters have earned over $15 billion, unadjusted for inflation. The list also notes that box office tracking was less reliable before 1981, and the summer of 2020 was essentially nonexistent due to the pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection, for HIV prevention. Clinical trial data suggests that this drug provides near-complete protection against HIV infection. This new treatment offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, which is a daily pill called Truvada. The cost of the drug, however, could be a barrier to access for many, and cuts to foreign aid could limit its reach in countries with the highest HIV burden.</p>

The site processes uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas molecule unlikely to travel far. While a release of hydrofluoric acid is possible, the underground caverns and collapsed rock would likely inhibit any significant environmental contamination.
