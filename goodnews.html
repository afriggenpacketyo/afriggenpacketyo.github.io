          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy strongly condemned the "unacceptable and abusive behavior" displayed by American fans at the Ryder Cup, revealing his wife was struck by a thrown drink. He expressed deep disappointment that golf, a sport traditionally known for its etiquette and respect, fell short of its standards this week. Despite the hostile crowd and personal affronts, Europe secured a 15-13 victory, which McIlroy proudly called the cap to his best career year. He vowed to ensure such incidents are prevented at the next Ryder Cup, scheduled for Ireland in 2027, emphasizing the need for higher standards in the sport.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, achieved a clear victory and a new parliamentary majority in recent elections. Sandu had previously warned of significant Russian interference, with bomb scares reported at polling stations across multiple countries and arrests made for plotting unrest. The outcome is seen as crucial for Moldova's future path towards EU integration, despite the nation grappling with spiraling prices and high corruption. This election signifies a strong public endorsement for a European alignment, reinforcing the country's direction away from Russian influence.</p>

          <h2>Goldman Sachs Forecasts China Rate Cuts in Fourth Quarter Amid Slowing Growth Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 00:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, projecting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This forecast stems from slowing economic momentum and increasing pressure on policymakers to bolster growth, especially as year-on-year growth could dip sharply towards 4% from a high base last year. However, the data-dependent nature of the People's Bank of China's decisions leaves open the risk of no action if the "around 5 percent" annual growth target remains on track.

          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls is creating unprecedented opportunities for small businesses, including health practitioners, yoga instructors, artists, and independent retailers, to secure prime commercial real estate. With national vacancy rates rising to 5.8% and rent growth moderating, landlords are increasingly offering more favorable terms like flexible lease lengths, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods. This trend allows local entrepreneurs to test physical presences without overextending capital, fostering local regeneration and reimagining retail spaces as community-centric destinations that reflect local identity rather than cookie-cutter chains.

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group surged 36% on its market debut Monday, following its spin-off from parent company Sony Group. The strategic move, which values the financial arm at over $6.7 billion, allows the unit to independently raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties with the wider Sony ecosystem. Sony Group cited competing investment demands in its entertainment and semiconductor divisions as a key reason for the financial unit to operate independently. This development occurred as broader Asian markets traded mostly higher, with investors assessing tariff developments and anticipating the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting.
