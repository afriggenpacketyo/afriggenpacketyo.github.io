          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has requested Secretary of State Marco Rubio to provide information on contingency plans related to national security, following a public dispute between President Trump and Elon Musk. Warren expressed concern that their disagreements could have serious implications for U.S. national security, especially regarding SpaceX and Starlink. She is seeking details on the Trump administration's authorities and options under the Defense Production Act to address vendor lock, monopolies, or contractor refusal to meet national security needs. Warren has been a vocal critic of Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration.</p>

The eaglets, born in March, are nearly 13 weeks old and will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging.

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt began their tenure with a clean sweep over a depleted West Indies side in both T20 and one-day international matches. Edwards was tasked with rebuilding the England team after a disappointing Ashes performance. While the series win is a positive start, it comes with caution as England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled on the big stage. Tougher tests lie ahead, including India's arrival and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>More than 100 dogs were rescued from an apparent puppy mill in North Carolina, where they were found living in "egregious conditions." The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs from a home where they were surrounded by their own waste, packed into cages, and free-roaming in cramped, filthy quarters. Many of the dogs, including mother dogs with nursing puppies, are now under the care of SPCA Wake. The shelter's medical team is treating the dogs for various issues, including skin and dental problems.</p>
