          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco, William Orrick, has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration's attempts to cut federal funding from numerous "sanctuary" cities and counties across the United States. This expanded order protects major municipalities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and Denver, which have policies limiting their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The cities argue that President Trump's directive, aimed at punishing non-cooperating jurisdictions, is an unconstitutional abuse of power that infringes upon the Tenth Amendment and local governmental autonomy. This decision marks a significant legal victory for these cities, highlighting the persistent legal and political battles over immigration enforcement and federal-state relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, a strategic move aimed at keeping these globally prized raw materials onshore to stimulate investment in its downstream industries. The country's Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry indicated that foreign investors are welcome if their projects include local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers, allowing processed metals to be exported. This policy positions Malaysia to become a key non-Chinese source for rare earth metals, capitalizing on the United States' increasing efforts to diversify its supply chains amid strained trade relations with China. Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities give it a significant advantage in this global shift.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the preferred destination for Chinese companies seeking initial public offerings (IPOs), outperforming the United States in the first eight months of 2025. During this period, 46 China-domiciled companies raised US$16.5 billion in Hong Kong, significantly more than the 16 listings that garnered US$740.9 million in the US. New shares in Hong Kong have shown an average jump of 19.4% on their trading debuts, compared to 3.6% in the US, making the city a more attractive market. This shift is largely attributed to the growing rivalry between China and the US, coupled with lingering risks of delisting for Chinese stocks in American markets, prompting mainland firms to favor Hong Kong's clearer regulatory prospects.

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially announced his intention to nominate Sergio Gor, a close aide who currently serves as the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, as the next US Ambassador to India. This appointment is significant as Gor will be tasked with navigating often frosty relations between Washington and New Delhi, particularly strained by ongoing trade disputes, including a planned doubling of US tariffs on Indian goods. In addition to his ambassadorial role, Gor will also serve as a special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs, highlighting the administration's strategic focus on this populous region. Trump expressed his full confidence in Gor to effectively deliver on his agenda and strengthen American interests abroad.</p>

          <h2>Parking Firm Ordered to Pay £10,240 After Losing Appeal Over "Five-Minute Rule"</h2>

          <p>Excel Parking, a private car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to the Access to Justice Foundation charity after losing a court appeal for a second time against Hannah Robinson, a woman it pursued for thousands of pounds. The dispute centered on Excel's controversial "five-minute payment rule," which penalized drivers who took longer than five minutes to pay for parking—a practice that was widely criticized by Members of Parliament and has since been banned by the private parking sector. Despite these rulings, Excel Parking continues to pursue legal action against other drivers for alleged infractions that occurred before the rule's ban in February 2025. This case highlights the ongoing struggle against predatory parking practices and underscores the urgent need for the government's planned new code of practice to better protect consumers.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) has reached a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's "dovish comments" at the Jackson Hole symposium, which hinted at potential interest rate cuts. This unexpected shift in policy stance triggered a "panicked repositioning" in the crypto market, leading to approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour. Shares of companies focused on accumulating ether also saw significant jumps. Analysts suggest that regulatory tailwinds and a boom in institutional interest around stablecoins, many powered by the Ethereum blockchain, have positioned Ether as a leading crypto asset and a major macro trade for the coming years.

The consulate will serve over half a million Indian Americans in Southern California, along with Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. Its prominent location aims to enhance access for American business leaders in various industries to Indian diplomats, fostering trade, investment, and cultural connections, despite recent US tariffs on Indian imports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced it will take a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, an $8.9 billion investment funded by grants from the CHIPS and Science Act. This unprecedented move, revealed by President Trump and confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, aims to strengthen US leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and secure America's technological edge. The deal comes after Intel faced criticism from Trump regarding its CEO's alleged ties to China and the company's struggles against rivals like Nvidia. This "creative idea" reflects a more direct governmental role in private markets, drawing parallels to historical interventions like the General Motors bailout, to advance national economic and security objectives.

          <p>Meta is set to unveil its "Hypernova" smart glasses, featuring a small digital display, and an accompanying wristband for hand gesture control at its upcoming Connect conference. These new devices, developed in partnership with EssilorLuxottica and expected to cost around $800, represent Meta's deeper push into augmented reality, following the success of its voice-only Ray-Ban Stories. The wristband, utilizing CTRL Labs' neural technology, is intended as a key input for future full AR glasses, with Meta hoping to gather data and attract generative AI developers. While Meta is setting low sales expectations for Hypernova due to its increased complexity, this launch marks a significant step in the company's long-term vision for wearable technology.</p>
