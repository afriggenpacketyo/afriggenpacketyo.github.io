          <p>During the recent summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addressed the abduction of thousands of Ukrainian children by Russia, an act that the International Criminal Court has classified as a war crime. While the exact contents were not disclosed, the gesture was acknowledged with gratitude by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This diplomatic effort brings renewed attention to an issue that human rights organizations have described as state-sponsored child trafficking, as U.S. lawmakers continue to demand the children's return as a condition for any peace deal.</p>

          <p>Wall Street saw a positive week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes closing at multiple record highs, driven by speculation about the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. The week's gains were largely fueled by a cooler-than-expected July consumer price index report, which increased expectations for a rate cut in September. However, momentum slowed later in the week after a producer price index report showed wholesale inflation rose more than anticipated. Despite the mixed data, market odds for a near-term rate cut remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, a period that has included the Princess's cancer diagnosis and treatment. A royal source indicated that the move represents a "fresh start" and an opportunity to leave behind some difficult memories associated with their current residence. The couple reportedly views Forest Lodge as their long-term "forever home," and they will be funding the move and any renovations privately, without using public funds.</p>

She achieved this milestone at the 5k run in Ormeau Park just four weeks after undergoing heart surgery. Chambers began her Parkrun journey in 2016 at the age of 88, following a suggestion from her rehabilitation team, and has since become a local legend and an inspiration to her community.

          <p>In Phoenix, architect Brian Stark is addressing the affordable housing crisis by repurposing old shipping containers into sustainable living spaces. His "X-WING" shelters, developed for the city, are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. These units can be built in just one week, offering a rapid solution to house the city's unhoused population. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex made from shipping containers, designed specifically for low-income or unhoused senior citizens, further demonstrating the versatility of this eco-friendly approach.</p>

          <p>Millions of current and former AT&T customers impacted by two major data breaches are now eligible to file claims as part of a $177 million class-action settlement. The breaches, announced in March and July of 2024, exposed sensitive information including Social Security numbers and records of calls and texts. Affected individuals can claim up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the breaches, with a filing deadline of November 18, 2025. The settlement still requires final court approval, with a hearing scheduled for December, so payments will not be issued until after that date.</p>

          <p>Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old billionaire CEO of Epic Systems, has built the dominant electronic health record software company by defying conventional tech industry norms. From its 1,670-acre Wisconsin campus, Epic operates under Faulkner's principles of never going public, never acquiring other companies, and never taking venture capital funding. The company's software is used in 42% of U.S. acute care hospitals, far ahead of its competitors. Faulkner, who compares her leadership style to a mix of Bill Gates and Willy Wonka, has established a detailed succession plan to ensure the company remains privately held long after she steps down.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson beat American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds for the victory, with Lyles finishing second at 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Despite the loss, Lyles remained positive, viewing the sub-10-second performance as a "great stepping stone" and a confidence builder ahead of the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, had been rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the intense force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a dive and rescue team eventually located him using a drone. A California Highway Patrol helicopter successfully hoisted him to safety, and he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>An academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to strengthen its position in the global energy and space sectors. This technology involves constructing large solar facilities in orbit that convert sunlight into electricity and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers. Unlike terrestrial solar farms, space-based systems can generate power continuously without being affected by weather or nighttime. The call emphasizes the need for a top-down national strategy to close the technology gap with countries like the United States, which has a longer history of research in this field.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police in the UK have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate paid as a deposit for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering, and the forfeiture was not contested by Tate or his brother. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million of the brothers' funds that the same police force confiscated in December 2024 for failure to pay taxes on business revenues. Authorities stated the seized money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential supplies for their dorm rooms. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware of the need for items like bedding, towels, lamps, and even basic cleaning supplies. The organization, started after a former foster youth described arriving at college with only a trash bag of possessions, allows students to choose their own items to personalize their new living space. The program aims to level the playing field, helping these students feel prepared and equal to their peers.</p>
