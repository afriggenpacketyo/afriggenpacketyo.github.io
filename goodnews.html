          <p>Stock futures climbed as investors expressed optimism that Israel and Iran would adhere to a ceasefire announced by President Trump, despite initial reports of potential violations. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress, acknowledging a steady labor market but highlighting economic uncertainties and the potential impact of tariffs on prices and economic activity. Oil prices decreased following initial spikes after the conflict began, with U.S. benchmark crude falling 3% to $66.49 per barrel and Brent crude also shedding 3% to $69.38. The central bank said last week it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% and the next Fed meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. (not investment advice)</p>

One fintech worker is subscribing to popular, high-capitalization IPOs, usually funded by margin financing equivalent to 10 times the principal.

The launch was initially delayed due to an oxygen leak and concerns about air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the ISS, but these issues were resolved. This mission will last two weeks.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago, and was about the size of a labrador. Originally classified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now believe it to be a distinct species due to unique features in its leg bones. The discovery is expected to shed light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and how they evolved into larger species. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers announced that he anticipates retiring after the upcoming season, his first with the Pittsburgh Steelers and his 21st overall, and intends to disappear from public life thereafter. Rodgers expressed a desire for privacy and a lack of interest in continued public attention, citing concerns over recent invasions of his and his wife's privacy by paparazzi and media outlets. Rodgers accused the media of publishing sensitive information and fabricating details about his personal life, emphasizing his wife's desire to remain private. After 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers and two with the New York Jets, Rodgers signed a one-year deal with the Steelers as a free agent this summer.</p>

The warship's presence in the Pacific also comes at a time when Washington has become more unpredictable, which introduces uncertainty to military alliances in the region.

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity. The decision came after mounting legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued that the injunctions were racially biased. Gang injunctions are civil court orders that can bar a suspected gang member from wearing certain clothes or associating with other alleged members of the same gang set within neighborhoods that are considered gang territory. Spitzer said his office could seek new injunctions, under the revised definition of gang activity under California law, if the need arises.</p>
