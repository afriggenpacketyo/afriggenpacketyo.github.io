          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asia</h2>

          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, growing by 8.1% year-on-year, despite the imposition of tariffs by the United States. This growth was largely fueled by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The article highlights that while exports to the U.S. fell by over 21%, shipments to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%. Experts suggest that transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts may have contributed to the surge, but anticipate a gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia, has made a remarkable comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Travis collaborated with AI and musician James Dupr√© to release two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," and has been touring since last spring. His wife, Mary Travis, explained that the AI process involved using raw vocals from 45 of Randy's songs and a vocal line from Dupr√© to create new music, emphasizing the creativity and effort involved.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to circumvent U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity to meet the new technical thresholds set by U.S. officials. This move demonstrates Nvidia's effort to maintain its presence in China, a crucial market, despite increasing restrictions on semiconductor technology exports. The article notes that downstream customers may be able to modify the module configuration to adjust the chip's performance.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by the U.S.-U.K. trade deal, with many papers highlighting its significance and potential impact on the British car industry. The Financial Times notes the U.K. secured concessions on car and steel exports but failed to reverse a flat 10% levy on most goods. The Daily Telegraph claims the deal includes a clause allowing the U.S. to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain. Front pages also feature the election of a new Pope, Leo XIV, with the Metro focusing on the speed of the selection process.</p>

          <p>China's exports exceeded expectations in April, growing by 8.1% year-on-year, despite increased tariffs from the U.S. However, exports to the United States fell by 21%, the sharpest drop in 21 months. Economists suggest that the full impact of U.S. tariffs may not yet be fully reflected in the data, and exporters are finding ways to navigate the tariffs. The upcoming U.S.-China talks this weekend could potentially lead to a partial rollback of U.S. duties, although a full reversal is unlikely.</p>

          <p>Producers of tungsten products in developed nations are seeking to diversify their raw material sources after China imposed export restrictions on the metal. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February, leading to industry panic. US defense contractors face a looming supply chain challenge, as they must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. China accounted for 82.7 per cent of global raw tungsten ore mined last year.</p>
