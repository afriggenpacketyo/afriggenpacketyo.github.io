        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean for the next couple of days, posing no threat to land. As of Tuesday morning, the storm was located about 635 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, maintaining maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and moving northeast. Forecasters predict Fernand will transition into a post-tropical cyclone by tonight or early Wednesday, eventually dissipating on Thursday. This marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which also did not make landfall but reached Category 5 intensity. The outlook for Fernand is one of continued diminishment, ensuring safety for coastal areas.</p>

          <p>In northwestern China's Shaanxi province, two construction workers faced a harrowing experience when they became trapped mid-air on a suspended gondola during an unexpected rainstorm. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, saw the workers stranded high above the ground for approximately 20 minutes, highlighting the immediate dangers posed by sudden severe weather. Emergency services were swiftly deployed to the scene, successfully rescuing both individuals without reported injuries. This event serves as a stark reminder of the critical need for stringent safety protocols and rapid emergency response systems in construction environments, especially in regions prone to sudden meteorological shifts.</p>

          <p>Former England and Team GB rugby player Heather Fisher openly shares her struggles with alopecia, a condition that caused her to lose all her hair within five weeks. She recounts not looking in a mirror for years and facing public prejudice, including being mistaken for a man and physically assaulted. Despite these challenges, Fisher, a 2014 World Cup winner, emphasizes the importance of resilience and self-acceptance, noting that the sporting world is slowly becoming more inclusive. She believes social media now offers a platform for athletes to share their unique stories and redefine perceptions of women in sport.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report has delivered surprising findings, suggesting that President Trump's tariffs, implemented from January to August 2025, are projected to reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over a decade, with total deficit reduction reaching $4.0 trillion. This outcome challenges conventional free-trade arguments, as the report indicates inflation has not spiked, growth has not plummeted, and substantial revenue has been generated. While the debate among economists continues regarding the broader economic impact of tariffs, this update provides a new perspective. The article also touches upon a pending legal challenge to the President's executive authority to impose such sweeping trade policies, a matter likely headed for Supreme Court review.

          <p>China has successfully launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, establishing the world's largest detector for elusive "ghost particles" called neutrinos. The massive facility, proposed in 2008, has begun collecting data with its 20,000-ton liquid scintillator detector, housed 700 meters underground. Juno's primary mission is to measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by nearby nuclear power plants, marking a "historic milestone" in particle physics research.

          <p>Rachid Meziane, the WNBA's first European-born head coach, is experiencing a challenging debut season with the Connecticut Sun after a highly successful European career. Meziane, who previously led Belgium to an Olympic fourth-place finish and a French club to a EuroLeague final, joined a rebuilding Sun team that has struggled significantly, posting one of the league's worst records. Despite criticism from a former player and uncertainty surrounding the team's potential sale, General Manager Morgan Tuck supports Meziane's consistent approach to fusing WNBA physicality with European tactics. Meziane remains optimistic about his team's future growth, emphasizing patience and adaptation in this new cultural and professional environment.</p>

          <p>A high school ID lost during Hurricane Katrina has been miraculously returned to its owner, Catherine Hamel, nearly two decades later. Park Ranger Becky Copeland discovered the 1969-1970 John Carroll High School ID on Horn Island, 55 miles from Hamel's former home in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi. The ID, initially illegible, became clear over time, allowing Copeland to track down Hamel via social media. This unexpected reunion brought back a memento of Hamel's life before the storm, which had swept away nearly all her possessions, offering a poignant moment of connection to a lost past. The story highlights the enduring impact of natural disasters and the power of unexpected human connections.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot expressed frustration with Newcastle United's defensive tactics following his side's dramatic 3-2 victory, questioning if he "saw a football match." The game, which saw Liverpool's 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha score a 100th-minute winner, was characterized by frequent stoppages, long throws, and a low ball-in-play percentage, the lowest in a Premier League match since 2010. Slot praised his team's resilience in a feisty encounter that included a red card for Newcastle's Anthony Gordon and 32 fouls, the most in the season. The match was further intensified by transfer rumors surrounding Alexander Isak, adding to the high-stakes atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest China should take a pragmatic view of South Korea's new government as Seoul and Tokyo pledge closer cooperation, with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung making Japan his first foreign visit. This move, the first since 1965, signals a foreign policy focused on shared international challenges and interests, often perceived as addressing the "China challenge." While Beijing might have low expectations of the Lee administration, the deepening ties between its neighbors underscore a shifting regional dynamic.

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign urging mobile phone users to wear headphones on public transport to curb "disruptive behaviour" like playing music or making calls on loudspeakers. TfL research found 70% of passengers consider such noise a nuisance, with some finding it very stressful, particularly those with heightened sensitivities like autism. Posters and social media messages will encourage headphone use and looking up from screens to offer seats. This initiative aims to foster a more considerate and stress-free environment for commuters, especially as 4G and 5G coverage expands across the Tube network, improving the overall travel experience for everyone.</p>

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its carbon market, incorporating major industries by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. New guidelines also mandate setting absolute limits on emissions, a stricter standard than the current carbon intensity-based caps. This move highlights China's commitment to meeting climate targets and aims to revitalize its often sluggish carbon market. The inclusion of heavily polluting sectors like steel, aluminum, and cement is expected to spur demand and lead to a more aggressive emissions reduction pathway for the world's largest carbon polluter. This policy shift reflects a serious effort to address environmental challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

While Bradley is highly ranked, the demands of captaincy typically preclude playing. His strong recent form adds to the quandary, but playing risks criticism if the US loses, while not playing might prompt questions about his direct contribution.
