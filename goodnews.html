          <p>Members of the USA Swimming team are contending with an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis during the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. The team's medical staff is actively treating affected athletes and implementing preventative measures to curb the spread of the illness. The stomach bug has forced some swimmers, including Olympians Torri Huske and Claire Weinstein, to withdraw from individual events to conserve energy for relays. Despite the health challenges, the team has shown resilience, securing silver and bronze medals in relay events and demonstrating their determination to compete at the highest level.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1st deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump but higher than the EU's goal. As part of the agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments into the U.S. While some European leaders expressed relief, others noted the new tariffs will still make transatlantic trade more challenging.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area has a unique opportunity to establish itself as a premier destination for sustainable, low-carbon tourism. Policymakers are already investing in green infrastructure, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. The author suggests that to fully realize this potential, the region must integrate these hardware advancements with innovative systems and partnerships that cater to environmentally conscious travelers. By leveraging its progress in smart infrastructure and climate innovation, the Greater Bay Area can create a connected, eco-friendly travel corridor that sets a new global standard.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at his Turnberry golf course to discuss pressing international issues. The agenda is expected to be dominated by the ongoing crisis in Gaza and the specifics of the transatlantic trade relationship. Starmer aims to press for further reductions in U.S. tariffs on UK goods, building on a previous deal. He must also navigate a delicate diplomatic path regarding the Middle East, balancing the U.S. stance with that of European allies, particularly after France's recent decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move President Trump dismissed.</p>

          <p>The recently announced trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union provides both President Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen with a political victory, yet key details remain ambiguous. The analysis suggests that while the EU avoided the threatened 30% tariffs, the new 15% rate is still significant, and the specifics of the promised $600 billion in EU investment are unclear. The agreement is presented as a landmark moment that averts a damaging trade war and rebalances a relationship the U.S. viewed as unfair. This deal also strengthens the U.S. negotiating position ahead of upcoming trade talks with China.</p>

A backup dancer quickly tried to assist, but Lopez laughed off the incident, throwing the broken garment into the crowd.

For some, the lighter schedule for major studios made it easier to access panels for other anticipated projects like "Alien: Earth" and "The Long Walk." The event highlighted a potential shift in pop culture, with television, anime, and fan-centric activities increasingly taking center stage.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to announce a public bank holiday to celebrate the England women's football team winning Euro 2025. The decision aligns with the precedent set after the Lionesses' previous Euro win in 2022 and the men's World Cup victory in 1966, neither of which resulted in a national holiday. While a celebratory parade will be held in London, the government is reportedly mindful of the economic cost of an extra day off, previously estimated to be over £1 billion. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously supported the idea, has not commented on the current decision.</p>
