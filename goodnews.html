          <p>Inspired by the "defund the police" movement, Austin and Seattle are making strides in shifting resources from law enforcement to social services and alternative public safety approaches. Austin has increased investments in homeless services, leading to more sheltered individuals than unsheltered for the first time. Seattle launched a third public safety department, the Community-Assisted Response and Engagement (Care) department, to address mental health crises. These initiatives reflect a broader effort to address the root causes of crime and provide more effective responses to community needs. </p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week remotely. Hybrid working patterns have become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. Despite some companies enforcing strict return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized in the UK since 2023. The research suggests that remote work has become a defining feature of the UK labor market, prompting businesses and policymakers to rethink office space and transport. </p>

          <p>A recent study challenges the common belief that homemade foods are inherently healthier than their processed counterparts. The research, published in the journal *Food Science*, compared the nutritional values and harmful compounds in both types of food items. The findings suggested that homemade foods do not necessarily offer superior nutritional quality or lower levels of harmful compounds. Experts emphasize the importance of monitoring nutritional parameters regardless of where the food is prepared, noting that food processing can offer tighter control of temperature and hygiene. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Scientists discovered that the anatomy of these flakes of invertebrate armor resembled the teeth of vertebrates, indicating a shared ability to sense the environment. By examining the tooth-like scales of modern-day fish embryos, they found nerves, suggesting that the armor of ancient fish allowed them to sense the water around them. This discovery explains why humans experience toothaches and highlights the evolutionary connection between ancient marine life and modern human anatomy. </p>
