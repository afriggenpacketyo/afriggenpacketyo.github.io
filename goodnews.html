          <p>German decathlete Leo Neugebauer secured a surprising gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, completing a "rollercoaster ride" season that followed his Olympic silver in Paris. The 25-year-old, who trains in the US, achieved his first major title by a narrow margin, excelling in events like discus, javelin, and the 1,500 meters, despite earlier struggles and knee problems. This victory, Germany's sole gold at the championships, also benefited from rivals' misfortunes, marking a significant milestone in his career. Neugebauer now approaches future seasons with a relaxed attitude, eyeing Olympic gold at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>

          <p>This opinion article leverages the historical narrative of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai's resilience after Jerusalem's fall to advocate for national renewal in a hyper-polarized contemporary America. The author argues against the current addiction to tearing down, urging a focus on building intellectual rigor, creativity, and community as a path forward. It critiques outrage-driven news consumption and the politicization of discourse, calling for a restoration of character-driven thought and stronger social bonds to combat loneliness and division. The article asserts that genuine societal progress requires moving beyond negation to collaboratively construct a shared future with humility and generosity.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced a significant acquisition, agreeing to buy weight-loss drug developer Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, including future contingent payments, as it aggressively moves into the rapidly expanding obesity drug market. This strategic purchase comes after Pfizer faced multiple setbacks with its internal obesity drug candidates, which were discontinued due to safety concerns. Metsera's pipeline includes promising oral and injectable treatments, notably a potential once-monthly GLP-1 drug, expected to bolster Pfizer's position in a market projected to reach $100 billion by the 2030s. The deal aims to combine Metsera's innovative portfolio with Pfizer's extensive resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has officially approved plans for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a £2.2 billion privately-funded project designed to significantly boost economic growth and create numerous jobs. This expansion aims to increase annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s, offering more destinations and potentially lower travel costs. However, the decision has drawn fierce criticism from environmental groups and the Green Party, who argue it severely jeopardizes the UK's climate goals and will exacerbate air pollution and noise. New stipulations include enhanced noise mitigation and public transport targets, though critics are exploring legal challenges.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that a recent "pragmatic, positive and constructive" phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping indicates an emerging paradigm of "managed rivalry" in US-China relations. Despite persistent tensions, the conversation suggests a mutual acknowledgment of interdependence, steering both nations towards accommodation rather than escalation. The article argues that this dynamic establishes a crucial framework for global stability, recognizing the profound economic asymmetry and interconnectedness that would render an all-out conflict mutually destructive. This shift represents a significant evolution from earlier anxieties about an intensified pursuit of American primacy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed extending the New START nuclear arms control treaty by one year, contingent on US President Donald Trump's agreement, to maintain the existing status quo for global non-proliferation. This treaty, which limits strategic nuclear warheads, is due to expire in February 2026, with renewal talks currently stalled due to ongoing tensions over the war in Ukraine. Putin's offer aims to facilitate dialogue with Washington, emphasizing Russia's willingness to voluntarily adhere to numerical limits if the US reciprocates and refrains from actions that could undermine the balance of deterrence capabilities.</p>
