          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced a national investigation into maternity care in England following a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The "rapid" inquiry will focus on the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, aiming to provide truth and accountability to families who have suffered avoidable harm. Streeting apologized on behalf of the NHS for the failures in maternity care and emphasized the need to prevent such incidents from happening again. The inquiry, set to begin this summer and report back by December 2025, will involve victims of maternity scandals to ensure their voices are heard and lasting change is implemented. The focus on accountability and systemic improvement aims to restore confidence in maternity services and ensure safer outcomes for both parents and babies. The establishment of this inquiry demonstrates a commitment to addressing past failings and preventing future harm.</p>

          <p>A Vox report delves into the conflicting research surrounding alcohol consumption, clarifying what constitutes moderate drinking and its potential health impacts. The report highlights the widespread agreement that heavy drinking is detrimental to health, while the safety of small amounts of alcohol remains debated. Experts emphasize that many people underestimate what qualifies as moderate drinking, leading to unintentional overconsumption. The piece underscores that public health officials aim to better educate people about the risks of alcohol, particularly its carcinogenic properties and potential for dependency. The goal is to promote informed decision-making regarding alcohol consumption, advising against starting drinking for health benefits while urging awareness of the risks associated with excessive intake.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Rice Prices Drop Below 4,000 Yen for the First Time Since March</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms, reaching 3,920 yen, the lowest since early March, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributed the price drop to the government's release of additional rice reserves, indicating that the government's message is proving effective. The market share of blended rice, including reserve rice, has risen to 50 percent. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to reduce the average retail price of 5 kg of rice to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June. While the price has decreased, it remains nearly double that of a year earlier, and core consumer prices in May rose significantly due to surging rice costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has introduced mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis screening for foreign nationals planning to stay longer than three months, starting with citizens from the Philippines and Nepal. The initiative aims to address the rising number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, particularly those from the six designated countries. Individuals will need to provide evidence of being TB-free before entering the country or face denial of entry. While TB is curable and preventable, it remains a significant global health concern, causing an estimated 1.25 million deaths in 2023. The screening program underscores Japan's commitment to public health and controlling infectious diseases within its borders.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for businesses and improving worker skills. The plan includes exempting thousands of businesses from some green energy levies, potentially reducing energy bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated the strategy is intended to "stabilise" and help "mitigate" challenges to the UK from abroad, particularly in the wake of events in the Middle East. The strategy also includes measures to speed up connections to the energy grid, boost research and development spending, and attract global talent. (not investment advice)</p>

Thune emphasizes the urgency of the bill, citing drying border resources, national security needs, and the impending debt limit and tax increase.

The vehicles, which still include a human safety operator, mark Tesla's entry into the self-driving taxi market. Analysts see this as a significant step for Tesla, aiming to compete with established players like Waymo and Zoox. The launch is seen as a culmination of a decade of hard work for Tesla's AI and chip design teams. The success of the venture will depend on improvements to Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, which has faced regulatory scrutiny and customer complaints.</p>
