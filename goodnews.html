          <p>Democrats are debating whether to prioritize fighting corporate power or reducing regulatory red tape, following Kamala Harris‚Äôs defeat. A new poll from Demand Progress suggests voters prefer a candidate focused on curbing corporate power over one emphasizing deregulation to boost production. However, the article argues that Democrats do not need to choose between these approaches, as abundance reforms can complement populist goals. The political case for abundance policies rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal, and there is no inherent tension between enforcing antitrust laws and relaxing restrictions on multifamily housing construction.</p>

          <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure air pollution levels and their associated health risks.
