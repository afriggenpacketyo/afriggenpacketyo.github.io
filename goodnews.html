          <p>The Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to play internationally for the first time in four years, participating in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series in the United Arab Emirates. The team, composed of players who fled the country after the Taliban retook power in 2021, will represent Afghan women who have been silenced and stripped of their basic human rights. Players view this as a major responsibility and an opportunity to send a message of resilience and hope to those still in Afghanistan. This tournament marks a significant step toward the team's potential readmission into the official FIFA structure.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes had escalated after accusations from both sides, including claims of cross-border attacks and harboring armed groups, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties. Under the new deal, both parties have committed to ending hostile actions and will hold further talks in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>An American woman who moved from Texas to Spain ten years ago reflects on the aspects of life in the United States she does not miss. Her list includes the limited paid time off, car dependency, the complex and costly healthcare system, and a pervasive sense of danger in public spaces. She also critiques the tipping culture, extreme political polarization, and the societal pressure to follow a traditional life timeline.

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Tim Curry reflected on his five-decade career, his life-altering stroke in 2012, and the release of his new memoir, "Vagabond." Known for iconic roles like Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," Curry has deliberately maintained a private and enigmatic public persona, which he says is important to him. The actor spoke about how acting provided an escape from a difficult childhood and how his stroke, which left him partially paralyzed, forced him to learn to speak again. Now 79, he continues to embrace his mysterious reputation while sharing parts of his story.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a new strategy to expand the clean energy workforce, promising to create 400,000 additional jobs by the year 2030. The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, needed to support the growth of renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy sectors. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to retrain veterans and oil and gas workers for green energy roles. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for lowering energy bills and providing secure, well-paid jobs in industrial regions.</p>

          <p>An opinion article praises two federal district court judges in Portland and Chicago for blocking the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to their cities. The author highlights the judges' courage in ruling that the president's rationale for the deployments, which described the cities as "war-ravaged," was "untethered to the facts." The article contrasts this judicial integrity with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to the administration. It argues that these rulings are a crucial defense of constitutional law against potential executive overreach and the normalization of military presence in civil affairs.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are encouraged to carefully review their health and prescription drug coverage for the upcoming year. Experts advise against simply letting current plans renew, as changes in provider networks, drug formularies, and costs could lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses. The article outlines the options available, such as switching between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans or changing Part D prescription plans. It also notes that the ongoing federal government shutdown could cause delays in accessing information, suggesting beneficiaries wait before finalizing their decisions.</p>
