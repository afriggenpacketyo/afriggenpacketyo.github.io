          <p>Japanese telecom giant NTT Docomo will discontinue its original emoji set, which was introduced in 1999 and helped popularize the use of visual language in digital communication. The company's new Android smartphones and feature phones will adopt Google's Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead. NTT Docomo stated that its emoji had "fulfilled their role" as Google's emoji became more globally common. The Docomo emoji were included in the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016, recognized for their role in humanizing electronic communication.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake in 2024, Japan is being urged to improve disaster preparedness regarding toilet access, as many public restrooms became unsanitary due to water and electricity outages. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and urge people to stockpile portable toilets at home and in workplaces. Educational programs are being implemented to teach children how to use portable toilets, aiming to prevent "toilet panic" during future disasters. The government is also required to make efforts to prevent defecation in evacuation center toilets to avoid unhygienic conditions.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some venture capitalists argue that embracing overwork is necessary to compete globally, many European founders and VCs disagree. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, work-life balance, and employee well-being, noting that Europe's most successful companies achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork. They also contend that Europe needs more funding and resources to compete effectively with the U.S. and China.</p>

De Kai believes that since AI learns by absorbing online content, we must be mindful of the influences it is exposed to. He suggests that by being conscientious about our behavior around AI, we can guide its development in a positive direction. De Kai's book, *Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future*, expands on this concept, emphasizing the importance of good role models for AI.</p>

The approach offers a new way to tackle infections that resist antibiotics, which are thought to kill a million people each year.</p>

The campaign is also seen as a way to identify promising cadres who follow the rules and show political loyalty.</p>
