Veggie burgers are also gaining traction, becoming the favorite in 13 states, indicating a broader movement towards plant-based eating.

This marks his first international festival appearance in 15 years due to a travel ban imposed after protesting the detention of fellow filmmakers. The film was secretly shot and draws inspiration from Panahi's own prison experiences.</p>

          <p>California officials have begun filling a complex of shallow ponds near the Salton Sea to create wetlands, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds and control dust around the shrinking lake. The project represents the state's largest effort to address environmental problems at the Salton Sea, which has been steadily retreating. The habitat area is being filled with water, with state officials saying the flooding of these sections will bring to fruition the first 2,000 acres of the Species Conservation Habitat Project.</p>

          <p>United Airlines announced a new check-in rule that will require all domestic passengers without checked luggage to check in at least 45 minutes ahead of departure, effective June 3. The change from the previous 30-minute requirement is intended to increase efficiency and streamline the check-in process. The airline says the added time will allow their agents to better assist passengers with luggage, seating, and arrangements. The check-in time for international travelers remains unchanged at 60 minutes.</p>
