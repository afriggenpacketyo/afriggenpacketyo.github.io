          <p>Apple shares surged by 5% in anticipation of an Oval Office announcement where CEO Tim Cook is expected to join President Donald Trump. The tech giant plans to increase its US investment commitment from $500 billion to $600 billion over the next four years, alongside launching a new American Manufacturing Program. This move comes despite Cook's previously mixed relationship with Trump, who has pushed for more US-based iPhone assembly and imposed tariffs that have impacted Apple's costs. The increased domestic investment signals a strategic effort by Apple to align with the administration's goals and potentially mitigate future trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have debuted at the Dvůr Králové Safari Park in the Czech Republic, a significant step in an international program to reintroduce the species to its native North African habitat. These majestic lions, extinct in the wild since the mid-20th century, are a symbol of strength, with fewer than 200 currently living in captivity. The cubs will eventually be moved to other participating zoos to enhance genetic diversity, though a full reintroduction into the Atlas Mountains remains a long-term vision. This breeding success offers renewed hope for the conservation of this critically endangered subspecies.</p>

This milestone follows similar advancements in other major sports, including the NBA, NFL, and men's soccer World Cup, where women have already served as officials.

          <p>Apple plans to invest an additional $100 billion in US manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion, as confirmed by the White House. This initiative aims to expand Apple's supply chain and advanced manufacturing within the United States, potentially easing tensions with the Trump administration over domestic production. While analysts note that shifting significant iPhone production to the US could be lengthy and costly, this move is seen as a strategic effort to avoid tariffs and bolster America's economic and national security. Apple has already opened its Manufacturing Academy in Detroit and continues to emphasize its US job creation.</p>

          <p>Human foot remains, discovered inside a hiking shoe on the shores of Utah's Fish Lake in May, have been identified as David White, who went missing in September 1997. Investigators linked the 1996-model hiking boot to White's cold case disappearance, which occurred after he went fishing alone and his boat was found adrift. The original search yielded no further evidence, leaving the case a mystery for 28 years. DNA testing confirmed the match, bringing significant closure to White's family and the search and rescue team involved. The discovery highlights the persistence of forensic science in resolving long-standing mysteries.</p>

          <p>The suspicious death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was reclassified as a murder due to critical forensic evidence. Detectives grew suspicious of Matthew Ecker, the only other person present, whose account contradicted scene observations. A small metal piece from the bathroom door lock, found beneath Pennig's body, proved crucial; it indicated the door was forced open *before* she was shot, discrediting Ecker's claim of breaking it down afterward. This key discovery led to Ecker's charge and subsequent conviction for second-degree murder, bringing a measure of justice to the tragic case.</p>
