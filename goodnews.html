          <p>Bruno Fernandes celebrated his 200th game for Manchester United by scoring his 100th goal for the club, inspiring a 2-1 victory against Chelsea. The Portuguese midfielder's performance highlighted his critical role and passionate leadership within the team, earning praise from manager Ruben Amorim. Despite occasional criticism of his temperament, Fernandes has been a pivotal player since his 2020 arrival, consistently demonstrating his commitment and influence. Amorim noted that Fernandes deserves a place in the club's history not just for his individual achievements but for what he helps the team conquer.</p>

          <p>Approximately 6,000 residents in a Hong Kong neighborhood were evacuated overnight after a 1,000-pound, U.S.-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site. Bomb disposal experts worked for nearly ten hours under typhoon conditions to safely defuse the device, which contained 500 pounds of TNT. The operation concluded successfully with no injuries reported. This is not the first such discovery in the city, which was targeted by U.S. air raids during the Japanese occupation in WWII. In 2018, three similar bombs were found in the city's business district.</p>

          <p>An armed man was arrested outside the State Farm Stadium in Arizona, where a memorial service for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk was scheduled to take place. The man, identified as Joshua Runkles, was reportedly exhibiting suspicious behavior and falsely claimed to be a law enforcement officer when approached by Secret Service agents. He was working as private security for an influencer attending the memorial. Runkles was charged with impersonating an officer and carrying a weapon into a prohibited place. The memorial, designated a high-level security event, is expected to be attended by President Trump and other officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has launched a campaign to "reclaim patriotism" from the far right at its annual conference in Bournemouth. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a theatrical speech, draping himself in an England flag and urging members to wave the nation's flags with pride, arguing they belong to everyone, not just nationalists who seek to divide. This new strategy marks a departure for the party, which has traditionally shied away from overt displays of national pride. The move is seen as a direct challenge to parties like Reform UK, as the Lib Dems seek to align themselves with mainstream British values.</p>

          <p>Following recent deadly flash floods in the American Southwest, the immediate threat has subsided, but another burst of monsoonal moisture is expected to bring a low risk of flooding back to southern California and Arizona this weekend. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to intensify and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season by late Sunday. The storm is forecast to remain far from land, tracking east of Bermuda before turning northeast into the open ocean. Forecasters are also monitoring another weak tropical wave off the coast of Africa with a low chance of development.</p>

          <p>Sonny Curtis, a pioneering rock and roll musician and prolific songwriter, has passed away at 88. A childhood friend and early bandmate of Buddy Holly, Curtis joined The Crickets after Holly's death and penned the iconic rock anthem "I Fought the Law." His diverse career spanned decades, including writing the hit "Walk Right Back" for the Everly Brothers. However, he is perhaps most widely known for writing and performing "Love Is All Around," the optimistic theme song for the classic 1970s sitcom "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Curtis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of The Crickets.</p>

          <p>A chaotic qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which ran for double its usual length, saw a record six red flags after numerous drivers crashed in difficult, windy conditions. The treacherous Baku street circuit caught out over a quarter of the field, with title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri ultimately qualifying in seventh and ninth place respectively. Piastri's crash in the final session presented a major opportunity for Norris, but a series of errors on his own final lap meant he could not capitalize. The mixed-up grid, with Max Verstappen on pole, sets the stage for an unpredictable race.</p>

          <h2>Social Psychologist Identifies Disrespect as a Key Destructive Behavior in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 14:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a major red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem and sense of self over time. Disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant ways, such as devaluing a partner's priorities, commitments, or identity. Nasserzadeh explains that people enter relationships to be seen and valued. She advises that if you feel disrespected, it is crucial to have a conversation with your partner to address the behavior and determine if change is possible.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its 'golden share' rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which employs nearly 800 workers. The company reversed its decision to idle the facility after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, exercising new powers granted to the government under the national-security agreement tied to U.S. Steel's recent takeover by Japan's Nippon. This marks the first use of these rights, which give the White House veto power over strategic decisions like plant closures. The move underscores the administration's increasing willingness to directly influence private sector operations.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses have secured their place in a seventh consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup final with a 35-17 victory over a resilient French team. Full-back Ellie Kildunne, returning from concussion, was instrumental, scoring two crucial tries in a player-of-the-match performance. Although France kept the contest close in the first half, England's powerful forward pack and improved second-half execution allowed them to pull away. The win sets up a final showdown at a sold-out Allianz Stadium against Canada, who defeated defending champions New Zealand in their semi-final.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old American woman from Atlanta has found a significantly lower cost of living by moving to the Japanese countryside to teach English. Lexi Smith pays just 35,000 yen, or about $238, for her one-bedroom apartment in the Chiba Prefecture, a stark contrast to urban rental markets. Her employer secured the apartment for her, which came with perks like no security deposit and covered key money. Smith shares her experience on social media to show an alternative to the well-documented, expensive lifestyle of Tokyo, highlighting the cheaper and more respectful culture she has found in rural Japan.</p>
