          <p>British number one Jack Draper advanced to the US Open second round, overcoming Argentine qualifier Federico Agustin Gomez in a four-set match. Returning from an arm injury, Draper expressed tempered expectations despite reaching last year's semi-finals, acknowledging a less-than-peak performance. Fellow Briton Cameron Norrie also progressed after his opponent, Sebastian Korda, retired injured during their match. Norrie, who also dealt with an arm injury in 2024, admitted to pre-match nerves despite his experience at Flushing Meadows.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to boost its struggling coffee division. Following the announcement, Keurig Dr Pepper's stock fell 11%, while JDE Peet's shares rose 15%. The acquisition, expected to close in early 2026, will be followed by Keurig Dr Pepper splitting its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic move seeks to enhance appeal to at-home coffee drinkers and compete in the cold coffee market, reflecting broader industry trends and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman, informed CNBC that he is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss operational cooperation. This clarification came after Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX announced a partnership for coast-to-coast freight services, aiming for efficiency without an acquisition premium. Following Buffett's remarks, CSX shares fell about 5%, and other railroad stocks also declined, as speculation about Berkshire joining a takeover bid for CSX subsided. The article highlights market sensitivity to major investor statements in the wake of recent industry consolidation attempts. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a total of 423 arrests over two days, police reported significantly fewer incidents of serious violence compared to previous years, with two non-life-threatening stabbings.

          <p>Netflix's animated feature "KPop Demon Hunters" saw unexpected box office success with a two-day sing-along theatrical release, grossing an estimated $16 million to $20 million domestically. Despite this performance, industry analysts believe it will not change Netflix's primary strategy of prioritizing its streaming service over extensive theatrical runs. The company typically uses limited theatrical releases as marketing tools or for awards consideration, leveraging "eventizing" to create buzz without traditional costly campaigns. The film's success highlights the potential for theatrical releases to generate publicity and cultural phenomena, further boosting its already high viewership on Netflix.</p>

          <p>Following Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole, markets are largely anticipating a quarter-percentage-point Federal Reserve rate cut in September, though the subsequent pace of easing remains unclear. Despite an initial rally, caution emerged as experts debated the Fed's future actions amidst ongoing inflation concerns and a resilient economy. Traders price in an 82% probability for a September cut, but certainty diminishes for further reductions later in the year. Analysts like Morgan Stanley express skepticism, questioning the urgency for cuts and warning of potential unintended consequences, similar to 2024's easing cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is reportedly on track to start the season opener against the Houston Texans, having successfully completed multiple workouts without any setbacks from his back injury. Coach Sean McVay expressed strong confidence in Stafford's readiness, indicating no foreseeable issues that would prevent him from playing. In a further positive development, left tackle Alaric Jackson, who has been recovering from blood-clot issues in his legs, is slated to join full-team drills next week. The team hopes Jackson's trajectory will mirror Stafford's, as his return would be a significant boost for the Rams, who are considered Super Bowl contenders and need their primary protector back on the field.</p>

          <p>While national union membership continues to decline, California has maintained a relatively steady share of union-represented workers, hovering between 16% and 18% over the past two decades. A report by UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Riverside labor researchers indicates that this stability is due to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at companies like Starbucks.

This longstanding policy allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, but President Trump's executive order will terminate it globally on Friday, having already ended it for China and Hong Kong in May. Carriers state their systems are not ready for the new customs requirements, leading to pauses primarily affecting smaller orders from European businesses.

He is expected to receive a more lenient sentence, given his age and reported poor health.</p>
