          <p>Japan and the United States have reported positive developments in their ongoing tariff negotiations, as indicated by Akazawa. The discussions likely centered on Tokyo's proposals to import more American agricultural products, with the Japanese delegation seeking further details from the United States regarding its priorities. This comes amidst broader economic uncertainty stemming from U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump, which the Bank of Japan is factoring into its growth and inflation outlooks. Japan has been urging Washington to reconsider these policies, adding complexity to the trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kohl's Corporation terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan for cause after an external investigation revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest with a vendor. The investigation found Buchanan directed the company to engage in transactions involving a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, failing to disclose this connection as required by the company's code of ethics. He also caused the company to enter into a multi-million dollar consulting agreement involving the same individual. Michael Bender, the board chair, has been appointed as interim CEO to revitalize the business, which is facing challenges due to sluggish sales and competition from Walmart and Amazon.</p>

The decision to move the marathon, which involves over 25,000 runners and significant city resources, was made due to logistical challenges of hosting both events on the same day, as the Oscars are held near the marathon route.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is departing from his role as National Security Advisor, with President Trump planning to nominate him as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim National Security Advisor, concurrently holding his current position. The decision to replace Waltz stemmed from concerns about vetting NSC staff and the Signal chat incident where sensitive information was disclosed to a journalist. Despite these issues, Trump respects Waltz and offered him a high-profile new role. The Senate will need to confirm Waltz for the ambassador position, with some senators predicting a challenging confirmation hearing.</p>

          <p>Sammy Hagar expressed his frustration with David Lee Roth, recounting their co-headlining tour in 2002 where Roth allegedly caused problems by frequently canceling shows at the last minute. Hagar, who replaced Roth as the frontman of Van Halen in 1985, stated he had to step in to perform on those nights to avoid disappointing fans. He also criticized Roth's performance style during the tour, suggesting he should have presented himself more as a solo artist rather than replicating his 1983 Van Halen show. Hagar emphasized his own successful solo career before joining Van Halen and his commitment to only performing songs he can confidently sing well.</p>

The photo revealed communications with figures such as Vice President JD Vance, Marco Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. White House Communications Director defended the use of Signal, stating it's an approved app on government phones. This follows scrutiny over a previous Signal chat incident where Waltz inadvertently shared information with a journalist.

          <p>Marco Rubio now holds four government positions: Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist for the National Archives, and Interim National Security Advisor. This unprecedented accumulation of roles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities, particularly with President Trump's unconventional governance style. The appointment was sudden, with State Department officials learning of it through social media. This situation highlights the trust placed in Rubio by Trump and his close relationship with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, but also raises practical concerns about delegation of duties and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

The exhibition, titled "Stories Brought To Life," features figures ranging from Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse, and uses technology to engage new audiences. The show will tour the UK after its run in Salford, but unlike the free access to original portraits in London, this exhibition charges admission. The use of striking paintings and photos with animation, music, and narration is a "powerful combination" according to NPG director Victoria Siddall.</p>

The high costs associated with the parade, including the movement of equipment and troops, have raised concerns.

These figures represent a significant decrease compared to the Biden administration, with some detainees being flown to Guantanamo Bay and El Salvador.

          <p>Manchester United, under manager Ruben Amorim, secured a commanding 3-0 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final, boosting their chances of reaching the final. Despite playing with 10 men for much of the game, Athletic Bilbao posed a challenge, but Manchester United delivered an impressive performance. This victory stands out as Amorim's best result as manager, given the opponent's strong defensive record in La Liga. The team's success in European football offers a potential path to salvation for both Amorim and United this season.</p>
