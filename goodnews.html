          <p>House Republicans, led by Rep. Julie Fedorchak, are voicing concerns about President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina, fearing it could negatively impact the American ranching industry. The lawmakers are seeking clarity on safety and inspection standards for imported beef, emphasizing the need for them to match the rigorous standards of the U.S. industry. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing the concerns of American cattle producers and safeguarding their interests. The proposal has sparked debate among Republicans, with some expressing significant reservations and others acknowledging the need to address cattle shortages in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight diverted to Salt Lake City after pilots discovered a crack in the windshield, potentially caused by a collision with a weather balloon. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, examining the windshield and speaking with the pilots. The CEO of WindBorne Systems believes one of the company's weather balloons struck the aircraft and is cooperating with the NTSB and FAA in the investigation. The company has implemented a software change to minimize time at active flight levels and is manually checking airborne balloons.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner stated that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent violence. Vance emphasized that the peace plan is ongoing and requires patience due to the long-standing conflict between the two sides. Despite the progress, some Israelis remain skeptical about Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to a lasting peace, while Hamas' top negotiator maintains the group's commitment to the ceasefire agreement. President Trump warned Hamas against breaching the deal and emphasized the need for the demilitarization of Gaza.</p>

He stated that any compensation he receives would be donated to charity. The DOJ declined to comment on the claims, but noted that all officials follow ethics guidelines in such situations.</p>

          <p>Despite rocky trade relations, President Trump has shown restraint by not antagonizing Xi Jinping or challenging Beijing's red lines. Analysts suggest that Trump's control over his administration and team of China hawks makes leader-to-leader diplomacy crucial. The American leader could prove to be a unique guard rail for Sino-US relations. Tensions persist due to the structural competition between the two powers, but Trump's personal approach may help manage the relationship.</p>
