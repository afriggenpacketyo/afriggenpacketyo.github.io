          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students after Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the ban. The Department of Homeland Security had revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students under the F-1 visa program, claiming the school tolerated "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" on campus. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating that Harvard had shown that it would sustain immediate and irreparable injury without the order, and that the revocation was a blatant violation of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Harvard professor Steven Pinker addresses the intense criticism leveled against Harvard University, which he argues has become unhinged. Pinker, who has been critical of Harvard in the past, counters claims that Harvard is a "woke madrasa" or an "Islamist outpost," pointing out the university's commitment to free speech and the diversity of thought among its faculty. He acknowledges that Harvard has issues, such as viewpoint diversity and incidents affecting academic freedom, but warns against a punitive approach from the Trump administration, which has slashed research funding and threatened the university's tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>Wage garnishment by the IRS can be stopped through various tax relief strategies, including installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, Currently Not Collectible status, and innocent spouse relief. Acting quickly and choosing the right strategy is crucial to halting or reducing the levy, and taxpayers should verify the amount owed and review IRS notices. Consulting with a tax relief specialist can help negotiate with the IRS and request a garnishment release while a resolution is pursued, especially for those facing financial distress.

          <p>A new study reported in The New York Times has found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound, with accuracy comparable to more expensive MRI scans. The study highlights the potential for contrast-enhanced mammography to become a standard of care for women with dense breasts at high risk for breast cancer, allowing for earlier detection and potentially saving lives. The method is not yet widely used for screening in the United States, partly due to concerns over allergic reactions to the contrast agent.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway has reopened to traffic for the first time since the Palisades fire, which incinerated homes and businesses along the oceanfront in January. The reopening of the 11-mile stretch of PCH provides greater access to Malibu and Pacific Palisades, potentially easing commutes and marking an important step forward in recovery efforts. Drivers are urged to exercise caution due to ongoing road work and reduced speed limits, with heavy traffic expected during Memorial Day weekend.</p>
