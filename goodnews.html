          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several strategic moves at the trade deadline, acquiring relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase, and outfielder Alex Call to strengthen their roster. While not the top-tier acquisitions some expected, manager Dave Roberts stated the additions "raise the floor for our ballclub" and provide crucial depth. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever with increased velocity, expected to fortify the bullpen. The team hopes these new players, combined with improved performance from their existing stars, will provide the necessary momentum for a strong postseason run.</p>

          <p>TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. This figure was shared by CEO Liang Rubo to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. According to sources, about half of the social media giant's 120,000 employees have been with the company for over three years. The data suggests that ByteDance maintains a relatively stable workforce compared to the high turnover often associated with China's demanding tech industry, especially since it moved away from the intense "996" work culture in 2021.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary John Bessent has expressed optimism regarding recent trade negotiations with China, stating that the meetings in Stockholm have "advanced our talks." In a social media post, Bessent indicated that the discussions are forming the basis of a potential deal that would be mutually beneficial for both nations. While he did not provide specific details on the agreements reached, his positive tone suggests a de-escalation of trade tensions. A Chinese commerce official also confirmed that a pause on new tariff increases, in place since May, would be extended, although the Trump administration has yet to formally announce this.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. This ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who could have lost their legal status and faced deportation in the coming weeks. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was racially motivated and did not adequately consider the ongoing crises in these countries. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and has stated its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Former Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen is reportedly in discussions with the team about a potential return. Allen, who spent 11 seasons with the franchise and became its longest-tenured player, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap measure. The potential reunion comes as the Chargers seek a veteran receiving option following the unexpected retirement of Mike Williams. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Allen could provide a reliable and familiar target for quarterback Justin Herbert as the team looks to bolster its offense ahead of the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling could significantly curtail the administration's mass deportation campaign, particularly an operation involving arresting parolees at courthouses immediately after their immigration hearings for expedited removal. The judge found the practice to be unlawful, noting that the migrants had "played by the rules" by entering with government permission and attending their hearings. This decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, including many from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to secure high returns on long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests three strategic moves for August, including determining the maximum amount one can deposit for the longest possible term to maximize earnings without risking early withdrawal penalties. It also advises savers to use this period of rate stability to shop around, particularly at online banks which often offer more competitive rates. Finally, individuals are encouraged to re-evaluate where their other savings are held and consider moving funds to high-yield CDs to avoid losing potential interest. (not investment advice)</p>
