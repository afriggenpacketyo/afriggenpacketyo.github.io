          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of various organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, addressing a key question in health and longevity research.</p>

          <p>A coffee culture craze is spreading across rural China, moving beyond the traditional preference for tea and creating a US$42 billion industry. This boom has led to a proliferation of countryside cafes that attract customers with unique natural settings perfect for social media. However, some observers question the long-term sustainability of this trend, suggesting that many businesses rely on a novelty factor that quickly fades. Despite these concerns, China's coffee consumption is projected to continue its double-digit growth, supported by a dramatic increase in net coffee imports over the past four years.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a 'landmark' review of the entire parental leave and pay system, aiming to modernize policies for maternity, paternity, and shared leave. Campaigners have welcomed the review, calling it the best chance in a generation to fix a system that has been overlooked for years and is considered one of the worst in the developed world. The review will examine statutory leave and pay, acknowledging that low pay rates deter many fathers from taking paternity leave and that the take-up for shared parental leave is extremely low. The goal is to create a system that better supports modern working families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 troops to California's command to help combat wildfires. The request comes as the state's specialized Guard firefighting unit is operating at just 40% capacity due to deployments for immigration-related unrest. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the troops, supports the move, emphasizing the critical need for firefighters as fire season intensifies. The decision highlights the tension between federal priorities and state-level emergency response needs during a period of heightened wildfire risk.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new wave of younger investors is significantly influencing market dynamics by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over established giants. He suggests these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their disruptive potential, while penalizing more traditional firms like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas. This shift indicates a move towards an 'idea market' focused on individual company stories and growth potential, rather than being dominated by institutional funds reacting to Federal Reserve moves.

          <p>Starting Tuesday, energy bills for millions of households in Great Britain will decrease by 7% under the new Ofgem price cap, providing a modest ¬£11 monthly saving for a typical home. While the cut is welcome, bills remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and analysts at Cornwall Insight predict prices will not fall substantially in the near future. They forecast only a small additional 1% drop in October, with significant uncertainty due to global events. Regulators are encouraging consumers to shop around for fixed-rate deals, which could offer more certainty and potential savings.</p>
