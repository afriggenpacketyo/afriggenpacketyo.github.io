          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Alcohol Consumption Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that alcohol consumption among Americans has reached a record low, with only 54% reporting they drink. This decline is attributed to increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation, and a shift in social norms. Younger generations, in particular, are showing less inclination to drink, influenced by health messaging and economic factors. Experts anticipate this trend to continue as understanding of alcohol's negative health effects grows. The article highlights a significant cultural and public health shift.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise. Chisholm's group will initially acquire at least 51% of the Celtics, with plans to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and private equity firm co-founder, will assume the role of the Celtics' governor, ushering in a new era for the team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study reveals that trained dogs can effectively detect the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, offering a new defense against the destructive pest. Spotted lanternflies, native to Asia, excrete a sugary honeydew that promotes mold growth and have spread to 19 U.S. states. Dogs, with their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and over 60% in outdoor, real-world scenarios, outperforming human searches. Researchers hope this method can be expanded to detect other invasive species, providing a fun and fulfilling activity for dog owners while protecting local environments.</p>

          <h2>'Zombie Rabbits' with Horn-like Growths Go Viral, Identified as Shope Papilloma Virus</h2>

          <p>Photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have gone viral, sparking curiosity and alarm, with some calling them 'zombie-rabbits.' Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the growths are real and caused by the relatively harmless Shope Papilloma Virus. This disease, mainly found in the American Midwest, is spread by fleas and ticks or direct contact between rabbits, but not to humans or other pets. The papillomas are generally benign unless they obstruct vital functions, and the rabbits' immune systems eventually clear them. This phenomenon is believed to have inspired the mythical 'jackalope' and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links.</p>

          <p>A brush fire in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park burned an acre of dense brush on Wednesday afternoon before firefighters contained it within 40 minutes. Light winds fanned the blaze, but there was no immediate threat to nearby homes or calls for evacuation. One firefighter sustained apparent heat exhaustion while battling the fire in the summer heat and received treatment. Helicopters assisted by dropping water on the dry vegetation as a smoky haze settled over the area. Hand crews remained on scene to address any remaining hotspots.</p>

          <p>A growing trend shows over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are bringing loved ones along on work trips, according to a TravelPerk survey. Motivations include reclaiming family time, especially for parents, and significant cost savings by combining business and leisure travel, known as 'bleisure.' Many employees do not openly broadcast these plans to their companies, fearing unprofessionalism, though the practice is generally accepted if work objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated. This shift reflects a desire for work-life integration and a flexible approach to professional travel.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is on the verge of losing his Infowars studio and brand as a Texas judge ordered the company's assets to be turned over to a receiver. This action aims to compensate the families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims, who won a $1.3 billion defamation case against Jones for spreading false claims. The receiver will sell Infowars' property, including its brand name, to satisfy the debt. This move signals a significant step towards accountability for Jones, potentially ending his long run under the Infowars banner and providing initial payouts to the families.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. These benefits are linked to the medication's ability to manage common ADHD symptoms like impulsivity and distraction. The research, based on 148,500 people in Sweden, confirms wider positive impacts beyond symptom management. While acknowledging side effects, the findings provide crucial evidence for patients considering medication, highlighting the potential for improved long-term behavioral outcomes and reduced societal burdens. The article emphasizes the importance of diagnosis and treatment.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Trump's restrictions on China's shipbuilding industry are prompting South Korean shipbuilders to invest in Southeast Asia, particularly ASEAN nations. This strategic shift aims to address competitiveness challenges against China, including limited capacity and labor shortages in Korea. HD Hyundai plans a significant investment of $550 million to revive a shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts view this move as a long-term solution for Korean shipbuilders to enhance their global edge, despite the time required to develop skilled labor in new regions.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur experienced a disappointing Super Cup defeat after conceding a two-goal lead in the final minutes against Paris St-Germain, ultimately losing in a shootout. Despite the collapse, new boss Thomas Frank's tactical approach showed promising signs for the team's future. His 3-5-2 formation and emphasis on set-pieces, a notable shift from the previous manager, were evident in their strong performance for the majority of the match. While the late concession highlights areas for improvement, the article suggests that Frank's pragmatic and disciplined style could lead to a more effective, albeit less enchanting, Tottenham side.</p>
