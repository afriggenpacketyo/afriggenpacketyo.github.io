          <p>The Trump administration's offer of expedited refugee status to Afrikaners claiming violence and discrimination in South Africa has sparked debate, with some Afrikaners alleging a 'White genocide,' a claim supported by Elon Musk. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has refuted these claims, emphasizing that crime affects all races, with Black people being the majority of victims. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp asserts that Whites remain economically dominant in South Africa, while farmer Nick Serfontein dismisses the genocide claims as untrue, highlighting efforts to train Black farmers and promote land sharing. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Afrikaner refugee program, asserting the U.S.'s right to choose its immigrants.</p>

Approximately 6,700 soldiers will participate, some in period costumes, and the event has been designated a 'national security special event.'

          <p>Southern California is experiencing a break from the recent heat wave, with temperatures expected to decrease and the return of May gray. Coastal areas will see temperatures in the low 80s, while inland areas may reach the 90s before a low-pressure system brings cooler, overcast conditions. The heat wave increased the risk of brush fires, prompting the Los Angeles Fire Department to respond to a 4-acre fire in the Sepulveda Basin. Forecasters are monitoring for another potential heat wave next week, urging residents to prepare for the upcoming fire season.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters following a court ruling that deemed the Trump administration's takeover 'null and void.' The decision reverses a two-month legal battle that began after USIP employees were forcibly removed from the building by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A federal judge ruled that the administration's actions were unlawful, leading to the reinstatement of USIP's leadership. The Justice Department plans to appeal the decision, while USIP intends to resume its mission of promoting peace and conflict resolution.</p>

          <p>California's E-Bike Incentive Program, designed to encourage alternative transportation, has faced technical difficulties, including a website malfunction that prevented applicants from accessing vouchers. The program, which offers up to $2,000 for eligible residents, aims to reduce car usage and greenhouse gas emissions. To address the issues, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has rescheduled the application window and implemented new measures, such as a virtual waiting room managed by cybersecurity and cloud computing companies, to ensure a smoother experience.

          <p>President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizures from white farmers contrasts with his own administration's use of eminent domain to seize land for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump has falsely accused South Africa of 'confiscating land' without compensation, while he has used government-sanctioned land grabs to build the border wall, offering compensation to landowners, albeit not always at the desired amount. This comparison highlights Trump's selective application of principles and his willingness to use government power when it aligns with his agenda.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America predicts emerging markets as 'the next bull market,' citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and a recovering Chinese economy. JPMorgan also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. This shift in confidence away from U.S. assets has boosted the appeal of emerging markets, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>
