          <p>Former USMNT players Landon Donovan and Tim Howard have criticized the absence of key players like Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, and Yunus Musah from the upcoming Gold Cup. Donovan questioned the players' commitment to the national team, especially when they continue to play for their club teams. Howard expressed disappointment that the full team would not be together before the 2026 World Cup and suggested that US Soccer needs to strengthen its relationships with clubs to ensure player availability for national team duties. The Gold Cup is the last international tournament the US men‚Äôs national team will compete in before playing co-host for the 2026 World Cup next summer, and the players' absences have raised concerns about the team's preparation.</p>

          <p>Ricky Sawyer, a self-styled "beauty consultant" specializing in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs), has been banned from carrying out cosmetic surgeries across England and Wales. The ban follows a BBC investigation that revealed Sawyer was performing risky BBL treatments, injecting large amounts of dermal filler into clients' buttocks. The court heard evidence of serious complications suffered by Sawyer's clients, including sepsis and necrosis. The injunction prohibits Sawyer from performing or arranging invasive cosmetic procedures and possessing related surgical equipment or antibiotics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant portion of Americans, both retired and non-retired, depend on Social Security benefits to cover necessary expenses in retirement. Financial experts recommend strategies to reduce reliance on Social Security, including maximizing tax-advantaged retirement accounts, capitalizing on lower taxes while they last, and contributing to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). President Trump has promised to protect Social Security but has also floated the idea of cutting taxes on Social Security benefits, which could accelerate its insolvency. These moves aim to provide more financial stability in retirement and reduce dependence on Social Security. (not investment advice)</p>
