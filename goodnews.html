          <p>The United States and European nations are reportedly finalizing a 30-day ceasefire proposal for the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, according to a French diplomatic source. If Russia rejects the ceasefire, new sanctions would be imposed. Finnish President Alexander Stubb indicated progress in securing a ceasefire after discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential declaration over the weekend. Trump has advocated for an unconditional ceasefire, warning of further sanctions if it is violated, a stance supported by Britain, France, and several northern European countries.
