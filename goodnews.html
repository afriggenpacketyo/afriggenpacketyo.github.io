          <p>Belgian cyclist Tim Merlier secured a narrow victory in the third stage of the Tour de France, edging out Jonathan Milan in a dramatic sprint finish. The 178.3km stage was marred by several crashes, one of which forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race. Despite the chaos, overall race leader Mathieu van der Poel retained the yellow jersey, with top contenders Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard finishing safely in the main group. The day also saw the recovery of 11 bikes that had been stolen from the Cofidis team truck.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, who is not seeking re-election to the House, has indicated he is open to pursuing higher executive office in the future, including a run for governor or even president. While he stated he would not challenge the current Nebraska governor, he expressed a desire to continue public service in an executive capacity. Bacon, who has served in Congress since 2017, cited the demanding schedule of a congressman and a desire to spend more time with his family as reasons for leaving the House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a new peer-to-peer messaging app called Bitchat, which functions without an internet connection by using Bluetooth mesh networks. The app is designed for ephemeral, encrypted communication between nearby devices, allowing messages to be relayed from phone to phone to extend range. This model ensures privacy and censorship-resistance, as messages are stored only on-device and no central servers or personal data are required. The project reflects Dorsey's ongoing interest in decentralizing communication technologies to maintain connectivity during internet shutdowns.</p>

          <p>Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli man held by Hamas for 484 days, has publicly called on President Trump to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. Siegel, who was freed in February under a Trump-brokered ceasefire, believes the president has the power to pressure both sides to reach a deal, bring the captives home, and end the war. His plea comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with Trump to discuss a new ceasefire proposal. Siegel also described the brutal treatment he endured in captivity and emphasized the urgent priority of freeing all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated 18 lions that were being illegally kept as pets in the densely populated region. The crackdown followed an incident where a lion escaped from a home in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Keeping exotic animals like lions is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite strict legal requirements. Officials stated there are over 500 lions and tigers in private homes and breeding farms in Punjab, and they plan to inspect all of them.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line-calling system to prevent a recurrence of a "human error" that caused controversy during a match. The ball-tracking technology was accidentally deactivated for a key game, leading to a missed call and a replayed point that drew criticism. In response, the All England Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system, ensuring such an error cannot be repeated. The incident has also sparked discussions about potentially implementing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tennis tournaments, for future championships.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Apple's recent activities highlights a stark contrast between its successes in media and its ongoing struggles with artificial intelligence. The blockbuster debut of its film "F1" showcases the strength of its services division and its ability to invest in long-term cultural projects. However, the company's recent AI announcements at its developer conference were met with a muted response, as its much-anticipated Siri improvements have been delayed. This disparity raises concerns that while Apple excels in some areas, it is falling behind competitors like Google and OpenAI in the critical race to develop sophisticated AI assistants.</p>
