          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge in its Hong Kong trading debut, with shares rising over 18%. Investors are optimistic about the company's capacity to capitalize on the expanding electric vehicle (EV) market. The IPO generated HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the funds to constructing a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. However, the company has faced challenges, including punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and scrutiny over alleged links to China's military.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing a challenging week as they attempt to pass President Trump‚Äôs budget bill, marked by late-night sessions and internal disagreements. The House Budget Committee convened late Sunday night to advance the tax cut and spending reduction package, following an earlier setback. The bill faces opposition from Republicans concerned about spending cuts, green energy tax credits, and Medicaid work requirements. Despite the challenges, Republican leaders are pushing to get the bill passed, navigating competing priorities and a narrow margin for error. The process involves long meetings and potential votes at any hour, reflecting the intensity surrounding major legislation.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, President Trump's appointee as president of the Kennedy Center, has accused the center of "criminal" debt and deferred maintenance, stating he will refer the matter to federal prosecutors. Grenell claimed officials found $26 million in "phantom revenue" in the center's budgets. The upcoming season will feature both union and nonunion Broadway productions, a shift touted as increasing options for audiences. The season includes "The Outsiders" but not "Hamilton," which canceled its run due to concerns over Trump's takeover, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will not perform there next season.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, these deals required politically challenging concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished economic position. While the agreements offer benefits such as reduced tariffs on British luxury cars and streamlined airport access for travelers, they also involve trade-offs like allowing European trawlers access to British waters and increased access for American agricultural products. Despite these deals, Brexit has cost the country 5.5 percent of its GDP, according to a 2022 study.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street is moving to Netflix after President Trump's administration pulled funding for PBS, and Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with HBO. Netflix will offer a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers, while the show will still be available on PBS. This deal comes after Trump issued an executive order to block federal funding for PBS and NPR, alleging they engaged in "biased and partisan news coverage." Netflix has been increasing its focus on children's content, which accounts for 15% of viewing on its service.</p>

          <p>China attracted a significant net capital inflow into its bond and equities markets in April, totaling US$17.3 billion, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and market volatility following Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets since President Trump launched his global trade war. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are factors driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea to accelerate decarbonization. The government hopes these plants will play a key role in mitigating climate change, as CO2 is highly soluble in water, and marine vegetation grows by absorbing dissolved CO2. Coastal and ocean plants, such as mangroves and kelp, are known to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points on Tuesday, marking the first reduction since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to shore up its economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders moved to reduce their deposit rates, paving the way to lower key lending rates.

          <p>Chris Mason's analysis of the EU deal emphasizes the ongoing tension in the UK's relationship with Europe. The government's self-imposed limitations intentionally restricted its room for manoeuvre in these post-Brexit negotiations. Those who see themselves as custodians of the original Brexit deal would see it as an unforgivable dilution, and those who have consistently argued Brexit is a disaster would regard ministers as shamefully unambitious. The government calls it a "reset" but in reality resetting, in one direction or another, is probably permanent or semi-permanent.</p>
