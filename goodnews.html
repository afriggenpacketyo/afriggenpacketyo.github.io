          <h2>Switzerland's Landslide Prediction System Offers Lessons for Global Preparedness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 12:59:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from DW examines Switzerland's successful approach to predicting landslides, highlighting its use of technology and continuous monitoring of environmental factors. The recent landslide in Blatten, where early warnings allowed for evacuation, showcases the effectiveness of the Swiss system, which includes terrain mapping and data collection on rainfall, permafrost melt, and ground movement. Despite Switzerland's advancements, the article emphasizes the global challenge of landslide prediction, noting that many regions lack the resources and infrastructure for effective early warning systems. International efforts, such as the UN's Early Warnings for All initiative, aim to improve global preparedness and save lives from these unpredictable disasters. The fact that no one died is a testament to the early warning system.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid on June 1 after Liverpool accepted a fee to release him early from his contract. The 26-year-old right-back agreed to a six-year deal with a 1 billion euro buy-out clause, allowing him to play in the Club World Cup. Following Alexander-Arnold's departure, Liverpool signed Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for 35 million euros, signaling a swift replacement. Before joining Real Madrid, Alexander-Arnold is expected to participate in England's World Cup qualifier and friendly match.</p>

          <p>Todd Chrisley, formerly of "Chrisley Knows Best," announced a new reality show following his and his wife Julie's pardon by President Trump after serving time for bank fraud and tax evasion. The new show will focus on the couple's legal battles and aim to "set the record straight," according to their daughter Savannah. Cameras began filming the night they returned home, capturing their reunion after being separated in prison. Chrisley maintains that his prosecution was politically motivated, while jurors had previously found that the couple submitted fake financial documents to obtain loans and concealed millions in income. The Chrisleys' case has drawn comparisons to President Trump's legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered his first public remarks since announcing his prostate cancer diagnosis, honoring fallen service members and Gold Star families at a Memorial Day service in Delaware. Biden emphasized the nation's debt to the military, highlighting that only 1% of Americans defend the remaining 99%. He spoke of the personal significance of the day, marking 10 years since the death of his son Beau, who served in the Delaware Army National Guard. Biden encouraged those grieving to know they are not alone, emphasizing the importance of unity and the shared sacrifices made by military families to defend democracy. The article notes that Biden announced on May 18 that he had been diagnosed with an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer, but his office later clarified that he had never received such a diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after correctly spelling "√©claircissement." Zaki, who was last year's runner-up, expressed that he instantly recognized the word from his previous studying and understood its French origin and meaning of enlightenment. In the final minutes of the competition, Zaki and the other finalists missed their words, sending the contest into another round, where Zaki ultimately triumphed. He described his spelling process as gathering information about the word before attempting to spell it, and he encouraged others to pursue their passions relentlessly, even after facing disappointment.</p>

          <p>The UK Treasury has sold its final shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of government ownership nearly two decades after the bank's bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. The government spent ¬£45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in RBS, now part of NatWest, to prevent its collapse, which would have devastated the UK economy. While taxpayers did not fully recoup the investment, experts argue the bailout was essential to saving the economy. The article also explores whether UK banks are now safer and less likely to require taxpayer bailouts in future crises. (not investment advice)</p>
