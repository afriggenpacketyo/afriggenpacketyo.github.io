          <p>The 2025 Tour de France will begin on July 5 in Lille, covering 3,339 kilometers over 21 stages and featuring six grueling mountain stages, including a finish on Mont Ventoux. Defending champion Tadej Pogacar is the top favorite, with rivals Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel also in contention. The race will also highlight sprinters like Biniam Girmay and Mathieu van der Poel. Safety remains a significant concern due to high speeds, with extensive security measures in place. While major doping scandals are a thing of the past, questions about performance-enhancing methods continue to linger in the sport.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that former President Donald Trump shares fundamental qualities with America's Founding Fathers, such as courage, vision, and a willingness to sacrifice personal comfort for the nation. The author dismisses anti-Trump protests as misguided, suggesting that Trump, far from being a tyrant, has fought against the kind of unchecked governmental power seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece posits that just as wealthy signatories of the Declaration of Independence risked everything for liberty, Trump gave up a life of luxury to serve the country. It concludes that Trump is a modern personification of the nation's founders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted a new safety measure, effective June 28, that bans travelers from carrying "substandard" power banks on flights. A power bank is considered substandard if it lacks the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (CCC) mark, a standard ensuring products meet specific safety, quality, and environmental guidelines. This new rule applies to all travel to and within China. To accommodate passengers, airports will provide designated areas for discarding or temporarily storing non-compliant devices and will also offer mailing services for those who wish to keep their ineligible power banks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which will see a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports, significantly lower than the previously imposed 46% rate. The deal also includes a 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a practice often used to circumvent trade barriers. This agreement is causing concern for other emerging Asian economies, as it suggests that future U.S. trade deals may involve higher-than-expected tariffs. The development does not necessarily signal smoother negotiations for the European Union, which faces more complex and contentious trade issues with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell, with the 10-year bond yield dropping after Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This eased market fears that Reeves might resign following an emotional appearance in the Commons and a major U-turn on welfare reforms, which created a ¬£5 billion gap in her financial plans. Analysts suggest the market's reaction indicates a preference for Reeves's fiscal discipline, fearing that her departure would weaken control over government finances. The stabilization in bond yields is significant as it can influence the cost of new fixed-rate mortgage deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has announced that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, is now complete and will be inaugurated in September. The $4-billion dam has been a major point of contention with downstream nations Egypt and Sudan, who fear it will reduce their access to vital Nile waters. Abiy sought to reassure the neighboring countries, stating the dam is a "shared opportunity" for development and not a threat. First launched in 2011, the dam began generating electricity in 2022 and is expected to more than double Ethiopia's power output, addressing significant electricity shortages.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court issued a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision ensures that access to abortion procedures will remain legal in the state. The ruling resolves a key legal question that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had created uncertainty about the enforceability of the 19th-century statute. The court's interpretation prevents the old law from being used to prohibit abortions, thereby preserving the current status of abortion access for Wisconsin residents.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively seeking to bolster its attacking lineup this summer, with a primary focus on signing a new center-forward and creative midfielders. The club has encountered difficulties in securing top target Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and is now making progress on a potential deal for Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres. Other potential targets include Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Real Madrid's Rodrygo, and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. The final cost of a new striker will likely influence how much the club can spend elsewhere, and Arsenal may look to sell an established player to help fund their recruitment efforts.</p>

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is proposing to restore a portion of Tulare Lake, which was drained for agriculture over a century ago. The plan involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland in the San Joaquin Valley to create a reservoir and wetlands. Supporters argue the project would provide crucial flood protection, create new wildlife habitat, and offer recreational opportunities, while also holding deep cultural significance for the Tachi Yokut Tribe. The ambitious proposal faces challenges, including securing nearly $1 billion in funding, acquiring land from major agricultural landowners, and ensuring a consistent water supply.</p>
