          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Alcohol Consumption Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of Americans now consume alcohol, marking a record low since 1958. This significant decline is primarily driven by increasing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation, a shift from previous understandings. Younger demographics, aged 18-34, are particularly responsive to this evolving scientific consensus, with a majority believing moderate drinking is harmful. Societal factors like the growing acceptance of sobriety, the popularity of 'Dry January,' and the rise of mocktails also contribute to this trend, which experts anticipate will continue.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This transaction represents the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise, following the Los Angeles Lakers' $10 billion valuation. Chisholm's group is set to acquire at least 51% ownership, with plans to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at an increased valuation of $7.3 billion. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and managing partner of STG Partners, will become the Celtics' governor, signaling a new era for the team. The sale is expected to finalize shortly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study has demonstrated that trained pet dogs can effectively detect the elusive egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, offering a promising new defense against this destructive pest. These insects, native to Asia, have rapidly spread to 19 US states, causing significant damage to various plants and promoting mold growth. Human efforts to locate their camouflaged egg masses are often inefficient, but dogs' superior sense of smell proved highly effective, achieving over 80% accuracy indoors and 60% in real-world outdoor tests. This innovative research highlights the significant potential for K9 teams to aid in early detection and control efforts, preventing further ecological and agricultural harm.</p>

Swift revealed she wrote the album while on her Eras Tour, recording it during breaks in Sweden, and described it as an 'upbeat' reflection of her experiences behind the scenes. She also playfully addressed her relationship with Travis Kelce, joking the podcast served as his 'personal dating app.' The interview offered insights into her creative process, including her intricate 'Easter egg' clues for fans, and her emotional journey to reacquire the rights to her first six albums.</p>

          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have formalized a significant ten-year, A$500 million ($328 million) security and business deal, known as the 'Nakamal agreement.' This pact aims to strengthen bilateral ties and strategically counter China's increasing influence across the Pacific region. Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles highlighted the 'shared destiny' between the nations, while Vanuatu's leader, Jotham Napat, hailed it as a 'win-win situation.' The agreement reportedly includes funding for two data centers and substantial support for climate change mitigation, alongside enhanced security cooperation. This deal is part of Australia's broader strategy of forging similar partnerships with its Pacific neighbors.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado exhibiting twisting black, horn-like growths have sparked widespread online curiosity, but Colorado Parks and Wildlife has clarified that the animals are afflicted with the relatively harmless Shope Papilloma Virus. This disease, prevalent in the American Midwest, causes these distinctive growths, which are generally benign unless they obstruct the rabbits' ability to eat or see. The virus primarily spreads through fleas, ticks, or direct rabbit-to-rabbit contact, posing no threat to humans or other animal species. Once the affected rabbits' immune systems successfully combat the virus, the growths naturally recede, a phenomenon believed to have inspired the centuries-old myth of the 'jackalope.'</p>

          <p>David Ellison, leading Skydance Media, has unveiled ambitious plans to revitalize Paramount following his $8-billion takeover, aiming to re-establish it as a top destination for filmmakers.

          <p>Firefighters successfully contained a one-acre brush fire that erupted in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park, Los Angeles, on Wednesday afternoon. Light winds contributed to the spread of the blaze through dense brush for approximately 40 minutes. Fortunately, there was no immediate threat to nearby homes, and no evacuations were necessary. One firefighter received treatment for apparent heat exhaustion while battling the fire in the summer heat. Helicopters provided crucial aerial support by dropping water on the dry vegetation, and hand crews remained on scene to address any lingering hotspots. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, faced record-breaking glacier-related flooding from the Mendenhall Glacier's 'outburst flood,' with the Mendenhall River peaking at an unprecedented 16.65 feet before waters began to recede. City officials expressed significant relief that temporary 'Hesco' barriers largely prevented catastrophic damage, sparing hundreds of homes from being inundated for a second consecutive year. This annual flooding originates from Suicide Basin, which fills with meltwater and forces its way under the glacier's ice dam. While the immediate threat has passed and evacuated areas reopened, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has initiated a multi-year study to develop more permanent solutions, as these outburst floods are projected to continue for decades.</p>

A TravelPerk survey identifies companionship and substantial cost savings as key motivations, enabling travelers to reclaim precious family time and explore new destinations more affordably. While some employees opt for discretion, many companies are increasingly accommodating this practice, provided business objectives are met and personal expenses are meticulously separated. This blend of business and leisure travel is a rapidly growing segment, valued at $315 billion in 2022 and projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is significantly closer to losing his Infowars studio and brand, as a Texas state judge ordered its assets turned over to a newly appointed state receiver. This crucial step aims to liquidate Jones's property to satisfy the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims, whom Jones falsely claimed were actors. The ruling empowers the receiver to seize Infowars' cash and property, potentially within days, and increases the likelihood of a sale to the satirical site The Onion. Despite Jones's vehement protests, this decision marks a potential end to his long reign under the Infowars name.</p>
