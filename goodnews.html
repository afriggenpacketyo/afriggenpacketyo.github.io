Owen had cited his Premier League goal-scoring record and Ballon d'Or win as evidence of his superiority at that age. Rooney, who looked up to Owen, emphasized the honor of playing alongside him for England and Manchester United. While Owen's career was hampered by injuries, Rooney enjoyed a longer and more successful career, winning the Champions League and multiple Premier League titles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Kiko, while now a Category 2 hurricane, is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it nears Hawaii, bringing increased cloud cover and showers. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Kiko will pass north of the islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, disrupting trade winds and potentially causing heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Humid conditions are expected due to rising dew points, and large surf will affect east-facing shores. As Kiko moves away, more stable conditions are anticipated with drier air and moderate trade winds returning.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors reacted to Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5%. Potential successors, including Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, are being considered, with Takaichi's deregulation stance and aversion to interest rate hikes driving market excitement. The Japanese yen weakened, and bond yields increased as investors priced in persistent inflation and tighter monetary policy. Elsewhere in the region, South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw modest gains, while mainland China's CSI 300 slid following weaker-than-expected exports data.

          <p>A joint China-US study analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes has discovered that Mars has a solid inner core, despite expectations that it should not. The team, using data from NASA's retired InSight lander, found the core to be approximately 600km in radius, about 18% of Mars' radius. This finding could revive the idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. The discovery suggests that Mars, Earth, and the moon all possess solid inner cores, challenging previous assumptions about planetary cooling and core formation.</p>

          <p>Following a large immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor facility in Georgia, President Trump has called on foreign companies investing in the United States to respect the nation's immigration laws. Trump emphasized the importance of hiring and training American workers, while also welcoming foreign investment and technical expertise. He stated that the US would make it easier for foreign companies to legally bring in their skilled workers, provided they contribute to the training and employment of American citizens. The raid, which resulted in the detention of nearly 500 workers, has strained relations between the US and South Korea.</p>
