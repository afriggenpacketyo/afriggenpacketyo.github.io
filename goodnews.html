          <p>A groundbreaking study has for the first time ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing significant differences between drugs. Researchers analyzed 151 studies involving over 58,500 patients, noting impacts like weight changes and heart rate variations within the first eight weeks of treatment. This article emphasizes that these findings should empower individuals to engage in shared decision-making with their practitioners, advocating for personalized antidepressant prescriptions. The study also highlighted that commonly prescribed SSRIs generally have fewer physical side effects, pushing for a reevaluation of current prescribing practices.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly nearing a trade deal with the United States that could involve a significant reduction in its oil purchases from Russia. Indian media outlet Mint reports that Washington might slash tariffs on Indian exports to 15-16% from 50% as part of the agreement. This article highlights President Donald Trump's assertion that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him of scaled-back Russian oil imports, though Modi's public statement focused on counter-terrorism without directly addressing oil. India, a major importer, has prioritized safeguarding consumer interests in a volatile energy market, becoming Russia's second-largest crude buyer since 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eurostar has announced plans to introduce double-decker trains for the first time through the Channel Tunnel, ordering up to 50 new 'Celestia' trains from Alstom. This €2bn deal aims to increase the fleet size by nearly a third and boost passenger capacity to 30 million annually, up from 19.5 million last year. The article details that each 200m train will seat about 1,080 passengers when run in pairs. Eurostar also plans an €80m investment in its London Temple Mills depot, as it faces potential competition from rival operators seeking access to cross-Channel routes.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading Wednesday as investors analyzed Japan's latest trade data and the country's new political leadership. Japanese exports in September rose 4.2% year-on-year, breaking a four-month decline, driven by strong shipments to Asia despite a drop in exports to the U.S. This article notes that SoftBank shares plunged over 5%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed losses. The data comes as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her new cabinet, including Japan's first female finance minister, were sworn in, with her loose monetary policy stance expected to weaken the yen and benefit exporters.

The company's earnings report highlighted AI as a significant opportunity, citing examples like using AI to de-age characters in 'Happy Gilmore 2' and aiding pre-production for 'Billionaires' Bunker.' This article acknowledges broader industry concerns about AI replacing human workers and its use of human-made content.

          <p>Japanese exports rebounded in September, climbing 4.2% year-on-year, snapping a four-month decline, primarily driven by robust shipments to Asia. However, exports to the United States, Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped 13.3%, continuing a downward trend despite a trade deal that reduced US tariffs. This article details that semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth, while auto shipments to the US saw a significant hit. Analysts note that while external demand is expected to recover, US-China trade tensions cloud the outlook, and policy factors like tariffs seem to have a larger impact than currency fluctuations on exports.

          <p>A NASA astrophysicist, Robin Corbet, proposes a new theory suggesting that extraterrestrial civilizations may not possess technology significantly more advanced than humanity's, potentially resolving the Fermi Paradox. Corbet's "radical mundanity" principle posits that aliens likely lack warp drives or wormholes, explaining why we haven't encountered them. This article highlights that the theory suggests civilizations might be too distant or technologically limited for large-scale interstellar travel or communication. This perspective offers a less terrifying explanation for the absence of definitive evidence of advanced alien life, challenging popular notions of highly sophisticated extraterrestrial visitors.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned gambling advertisements from Kwiff and Betway featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. The ban stems from concerns that these figures and symbols have a strong appeal to individuals under 18, violating advertising guidelines. This article details that the ASA cited Hamilton's significant youth following on social media, his appearance in a children's video game, and his role as a CBeebies storyteller. Both betting firms were warned against including characters with strong appeal to minors, with Kwiff having since removed such content.</p>

The troops, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, are scheduled to be in the city for major events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. This article highlights that the New Orleans Police Department, currently understaffed, views the Guard as a "force multiplier" for public safety. Kirkpatrick clarified that while crime is down, the Guard's role is not to take over, but to assist in specific functions.</p>

          <p>Gold and silver prices tumbled significantly, marking their biggest daily drops in years, as a recent rally in precious metals came to a halt. Spot gold fell over 6%, its largest intraday drop since 2013, while silver plummeted more than 8%. This article attributes the decline to easing US-China trade tensions, a stronger US dollar, and technical indicators showing overbought conditions. Despite the pullback, analysts remain bullish on precious metals, forecasting higher prices in the coming years due to persistent inflation, low real interest rates, and geopolitical concerns, suggesting this is likely a temporary correction.

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with a surge in copper wire theft, leaving many communities in darkness and costing millions in repairs, as exemplified by the unlit Sixth Street Bridge. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal. This article highlights that the bill will require junk dealers to verify sellers' identities and lawful ownership, making possession of certain public scrap metal illegal and increasing penalties for non-compliance. City leaders hope this legislation will curb the crime, which accounts for nearly half of streetlight outages and poses significant safety risks.</p>
