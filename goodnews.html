          <p>With credit card interest rates near record highs, debt forgiveness programs that can reduce balances by 30% to 50% are an attractive option for consumers facing financial hardship. However, these programs are not universally suitable and come with significant consequences, including a negative impact on one's credit score. The article suggests that while forgiveness can provide essential relief and financial freedom for those who qualify, it's crucial to first explore all alternative debt relief options. A thorough evaluation of personal circumstances is necessary before committing to this path. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Portugal recently witnessed a rare and dramatic weather phenomenon known as a "roll cloud," which resembles a horizontal tube rolling across the sky. The striking formation, sometimes called a "tsunami cloud," appeared following a period of intense heat that gave way to thunderstorms and heavy rain. According to the National Weather Service, these low-hanging arcus clouds are relatively uncommon and are typically associated with thunderstorm outflows. The event captured widespread attention on social media, with many users sharing videos and expressing awe at the cinematic sight.</p>

          <p>The clean energy sector saw a significant stock market rally after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China and was projected to cost the industry billions. Following its removal, shares of major renewable energy companies like NextEra Energy and AES rose, and solar-focused ETFs also saw substantial gains. Despite this victory, industry groups remain critical of the overall bill, warning it could still undermine America's progress in renewable energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in an effort to address the state's severe housing shortage. The new rules will exempt most urban "infill" housing projects from the lengthy and often costly environmental reviews that have been blamed for stifling development. Governor Gavin Newsom championed the change as a critical step toward solving the housing affordability crisis. However, the move was met with strong opposition from environmental and social justice groups, who argue it undermines public participation and protections against environmental risks.</p>

The article explains that this question often catches hiring managers off guard, leading to more honest and revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" or "someone who is too social" can provide critical insights into how work actually gets done.

          <p>As home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) become a more popular borrowing tool, financial experts are highlighting common mistakes homeowners should avoid. The article warns against failing to monitor the variable interest rate climate, as rates can change daily and affect long-term costs. Another pitfall is overborrowing; even if HELOC rates are lower than credit cards, the home serves as collateral, making default a high-stakes risk. Finally, experts advise using the funds for strategic purposes like value-adding home renovations rather than for discretionary spending like vacations. (not investment advice)</p>
