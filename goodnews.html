          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that President Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before," despite the lack of a formal ceasefire agreement at the Alaska summit. Starmer commended Trump's leadership and welcomed the U.S.'s openness to providing security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a potential deal. He affirmed that the path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that allies will continue to pressure Russia with sanctions until its "barbaric assault" ends.</p>

The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, recently hosted its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling its intent to reclaim its former cultural relevance. While facing a changed retail landscape with fierce competition from fast-fashion giants like Shein, Topshop aims to leverage nostalgia and its distinct "London girl" aesthetic to attract both its former millennial customers and a new generation of shoppers.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter is said to have raised concerns about the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and forcibly transferred to Russia since the 2022 invasion. This issue is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for his alleged role. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the matter, calling it a true act of humanism.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both achieved multiple record closes this week, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected July inflation report. The data increased market expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming September meeting. Despite a subsequent report showing a slight rise in wholesale inflation, momentum continued, with major portfolio names like Goldman Sachs, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms hitting all-time highs during the week's trading sessions.

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, an architect is tackling the affordable housing crisis by designing and building shelters for the unhoused population using old shipping containers. The "X-WING" shelters, developed by Brian Stark's firm, are constructed in just one week and feature four containers joined in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. This sustainable approach not only repurposes existing materials but also provides quick, dignified housing, with plans to expand the concept into a larger apartment complex for low-income seniors.</p>

While ICE has cited the need for more resources to meet administration goals, activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts, such as rapid-response hotlines and legal challenges, may be contributing to slowing the pace of arrests and deportations in certain regions.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to create a national, top-down strategy to accelerate the development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building large solar arrays in orbit that collect energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action emphasizes the need to close the technological gap with the United States in this emerging sector, which is seen as critical for both future energy security and the ongoing space race.</p>
