          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth saw a significant jump in extended trading after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in close communication with the Trump administration. This engagement aligns with the administration's strategy to strengthen the domestic rare earth supply chain, following its recent equity stakes in other key miners like Lithium Americas and MP Materials. Humpton indicated that the rare earth market is not a zero-sum game, requiring many participants, and supports the administration's efforts to reduce U.S. dependence on China. The company is actively developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, underscoring its role in these strategic initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

Dillon Dingler's sixth-inning home run broke a tie, and Wenceel Pérez drove in two runs during a pivotal four-run seventh inning that sealed Detroit's victory. This marks the second consecutive season the Tigers have won a Wild Card Series on the road, showcasing their playoff resilience. Despite the AL Central champion Guardians' remarkable mid-season comeback, they were ultimately eliminated, while the Tigers, who had a poor September, found their form at the crucial moment.</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released an updated report advocating a "planetary health diet" rich in nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with significantly less meat, dairy, and sugar. This dietary shift is projected to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by over half and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually. Despite widespread scientific acceptance, the report anticipates a coordinated misinformation campaign, similar to the backlash against its 2019 findings, fueled by meat and dairy industry interests and amplified by social media and AI tools. The commission aims to counter this by emphasizing the diet's delicious, aspirational, and healthy aspects.</p>

        </div>

          <p>California has introduced a new driver's license and identification card design, incorporating enhanced security measures including a first-in-the-nation digital signature on one of the barcodes. The updated cards, which began issuance on Wednesday, feature new imagery of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, replacing older designs like the gold miner. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, with no immediate need for replacement, and renewal fees are unchanged. This redesign also removes the magnetic stripe and maintains the REAL ID symbol, reflecting periodic efforts to improve security and prevent counterfeiting since the last major update in 2010.</p>

          <p>Stable Recovery, a unique drug and alcohol rehabilitation program, offers individuals a second chance at life through working with thoroughbred horses at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky. The program, co-founded by two men in recovery, addresses both addiction and the horse industry's labor shortage by training residents in horse care and farm operations. Participants, many of whom were previously homeless or incarcerated, find purpose and healing through the non-judgmental bond with horses and the program's strong community. The year-long, free initiative boasts high sobriety rates and is now expanding to include a women's house, with hopes for national replication.</p>

          <h2>Pfizer Agrees to Trump's Drug Pricing Demands, Offering Discounts and International Parity</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant deal with Pfizer, wherein the pharmaceutical giant pledged to lower U.S. drug costs to match prices in other developed countries. This agreement, a long-sought victory for Trump, also includes Pfizer's participation in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted drugs directly to consumers. The concession follows Trump's aggressive tactics, including threats of 100% tariffs on drugmakers not manufacturing in the U.S., from which Pfizer received a three-year exemption. While the immediate impact on patients' out-of-pocket costs remains somewhat ambiguous, this marks a notable shift in the pharmaceutical industry's resistance to government-mandated price reductions.

          <h2>The Evolution of College Rankings: From Controversial Lists to a Cultural Staple</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 17:38:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>College rankings, now a ubiquitous part of higher education, began as controversial experiments, with early attempts often met with public outcry and official suppression. Edwin Embree's informal 1934 list and Kendric Babcock's 1911 government study both triggered significant backlash, highlighting institutional anxieties and the public's intense interest. The article traces how rankings evolved from simple curiosities to a vital map of the American meritocracy by the 1980s, driven by increased consumer demand and shifting admissions landscapes. U.S. News & World Report capitalized on this, eventually refining its methods to become the influential juggernaut it is today, despite ongoing debates about its impact and accuracy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that focusing solely on China's economic stagnation overlooks a profound restructuring driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Unlike their predecessors, this post-famine cohort, largely born between the 1960s and early 1980s, is technically trained, innovation-driven, and adept at co-creation with government and other partners. Hailing often from provinces known for strong business cultures, these leaders blend past experiences of scarcity with current market and technological opportunities. Their collective efforts are fostering competitiveness at scale and continuing to integrate China into global systems, presenting a dynamic picture of economic resilience and evolution.</p>

          <p>A TikTok user, Paula (@genxpaula58v2), shared how her son, a long-time Donald Trump supporter, finally distanced himself from the former president after being disturbed by Trump's politically charged remarks at Charlie Kirk's memorial service. The son, unsettled by Trump's focus on enemies during a moment of mourning, realized what he perceived as the president's selfishness. This personal revelation, influenced by his experience raising a child with autism, brought immense relief to Paula, who felt she "finally had her son back" after years of political disagreement. The video garnered significant support online, with many echoing similar sentiments about Trump's rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A team of treasure hunters off Florida's aptly named "treasure coast" has discovered over 1,000 silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, from a 1715 Spanish fleet shipwreck.

This rare and extraordinary find, with visible dates and mint marks, offers valuable historical insights into the Spanish empire's golden age and maritime trade. The discovery not only yields significant monetary value but also provides tangible links to the people and rich history of centuries past, making each coin a cherished piece of history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean religion rooted in Yoruba cosmology that emerged as a practice of survival and resistance among enslaved Africans in Cuba. It highlights how practitioners like Francisco Álvarez León find grounding, community, and connection through its principles of balance and connection to divine orishas. Scholars emphasize Lucumí's focus on health, well-being, and character, challenging persistent stereotypes that demonize it as "witchcraft" or "black magic." The article explains how the religion adapted and thrived despite colonial suppression, continuing to offer protection, healing, and remembrance in a world often hostile to non-white spiritual traditions.</p>
