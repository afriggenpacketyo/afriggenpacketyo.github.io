          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:49:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a version of its classic soda sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall. This move addresses a long-standing consumer preference for "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar instead of the high-fructose corn syrup found in the American version since the 1980s. The announcement followed public comments by President Donald Trump advocating for the change, although research indicates cane sugar is not a healthier alternative to corn syrup. This new product is part of Coke's strategy to offer more choices, even as it promotes its Zero Sugar line.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has reshuffled her senior team, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. This move places him in direct opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The shake-up includes several other changes, such as Kevin Hollinrake becoming the new party chairman and Stuart Andrew moving to the health brief. The reshuffle is described as reflecting the next stage of the party's policy renewal as it struggles in the polls eight months into Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <p>Five-year-old startup Imprint has successfully won a competitive bid to launch a new co-branded credit card with online shopping platform Rakuten, surpassing established financial institutions. This deal highlights Imprint's growing influence in the lucrative co-branded card industry, which is traditionally dominated by giants like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. To support its growth and demonstrate stability to partners, the New York-based company recently raised an additional $70 million, increasing its valuation to $900 million. Imprint focuses on a seamless digital experience and transparent fee structures to differentiate itself from incumbent banks.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders has acknowledged that he is still recovering from an undisclosed health issue that has limited his activities during the offseason. In a video posted online, Sanders mentioned he is "still going through something" and is not fully recovered, though he was seen engaging in physical activities like tennis and running. Previously, at the Big 12 media day, he had declined to discuss his health, stating he was focused on his team. Sanders is entering his third season as head coach of the Buffaloes after leading them to a 9-4 record last year.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the European Union, caught between escalating trade tensions with the United States and a complex relationship with China, has an opportunity to improve its strategic position. With the U.S. threatening significant tariffs, the EU could strengthen its bargaining power by pragmatically engaging with China ahead of an upcoming summit. The analysis notes that while China's support for Russia in the Ukraine war is a major obstacle, the EU must also consider China's own security concerns regarding its rivalry with the U.S. The article posits that by reassessing its alignment with U.S. tech restrictions on China, the EU could rechart its course.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. The beverage giant's organic revenue grew by 5%, though global unit case volume saw a slight 1% decline, with weakness in North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific. The company narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the top end of its previous range. The report also included the announcement of a new cane sugar version of its classic cola to be launched in the U.S. this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox in a highly unusual fashion, winning 3-2 on a walk-off catcher's interference call. In the 10th inning with the bases loaded, Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's swing made contact with the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez. After a review confirmed the contact, Sosa was awarded first base, forcing in the winning run. This marked the first instance of a walk-off catcher's interference in a Major League Baseball game since 1971. The strange ending capped a tight game where the Phillies won without putting a ball in play in the final inning.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are in discussions about a potential collaboration on a spaceport focused on suborbital flights, according to the American Institute in Taiwan. This emerging technology, where a vehicle briefly enters space before gliding to a landing, could dramatically reduce travel times. If realized, the partnership could shorten the journey between Houston and Taipei from over 14 hours to as little as two and a half hours. The proposed cooperation would leverage Houston's Ellington Airport, which is already a licensed spaceport, and is part of a global push to develop ultra-fast travel and cargo delivery.</p>

The Lions regained the lead with a second try from Osborne and another from Duhan van der Merwe. However, a late try from the hosts ensured a tense finish, in a performance that may have left the Lions' head coach disappointed.</p>

The automaker's adjusted earnings were $2.53 per share on revenue of $47.12 billion, though net income was down 35.4% from a year earlier.

          <p>China's Jiangsu province is narrowing the economic gap with Guangdong, threatening its long-held status as the country's top provincial economy. In the first half of 2025, Jiangsu's GDP reached 97.44% of Guangdong's, the closest margin in years. Analysts attribute Jiangsu's resilience to its diversified industrial structure, lower dependence on real estate, and smaller reliance on exports compared to Guangdong. In contrast, Guangdong, a traditional export powerhouse, has seen its export growth slow dramatically, contributing to the narrowing gap between the two economic giants.</p>
