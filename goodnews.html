          <p>The Cannes Film Festival experienced a power outage due to a fire at an electrical substation, with authorities investigating possible arson. Despite the disruption, power was restored hours before the Palme d'Or ceremony, allowing scheduled events to proceed as planned. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, causing traffic jams and store closures. The Palme d'Or was awarded to Jafar Panahi's "It Was Just an Accident," concluding the festival's events after the earlier uncertainty. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>In a symbolic move, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's independence from the United States, particularly in response to President Trump's undermining of Canadian sovereignty. This visit, the first by a British monarch to deliver a throne speech since 1977, underscores Canada's unique traditions and parliamentary system modeled after Britain's Westminster system. While most Canadians are indifferent to the monarchy, Carney's gesture serves as a strong affirmation of Canada's distinct identity amid ongoing economic and political challenges posed by the US.

          <p>Young men in the US are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that emphasize a virile, unapologetic form of masculinity. These churches, like the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), attract men uneasy with modern American life, offering a traditional, disciplined environment. Converts often homeschool their children, believing women should prioritize family, and express concerns about what they perceive as societal criticism of traditional male roles. While numbers are small compared to evangelical megachurches, this trend reflects broader political shifts and a desire for a faith that provides a sense of strength and order.

          <p>New high-definition images capture the wreckage of the USS F-1, a U.S. submarine lost at sea in 1917 during a training accident off the coast of California. The submarine collided with its sister ship, resulting in the deaths of 19 crew members. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution team used advanced deep-sea imaging technology, including a human-piloted submersible and a remote underwater vehicle, to conduct detailed surveys. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950. The optimism score is 65.</p>
