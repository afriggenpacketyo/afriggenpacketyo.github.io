          <h2>Strategies for Student Loan Borrowers to Avoid Default Amidst Increased Collection Efforts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration intensifies efforts to collect on student loans, borrowers facing delinquency or default need to take immediate action to protect their finances. Delinquency occurs after missing a payment, potentially leading to credit score drops and higher borrowing costs, while default, after 270 days of non-payment, triggers severe consequences such as wage garnishments and seizure of tax refunds. The article advises borrowers to contact their loan servicers promptly to request retroactive forbearance and enroll in affordable repayment plans, including income-driven options, to avoid these adverse outcomes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court's decision in a police violence case, Barnes v. Felix, emphasizing the need to consider the 'totality of the circumstances' when evaluating excessive force claims. The case involved a fatal police shooting during a traffic stop, and the Fifth Circuit Court had narrowly focused only on the moment of the shooting, disregarding preceding events. The Supreme Court's ruling requires the lower court to reconsider the case, taking into account all relevant factors leading up to the incident, which could impact how courts assess police conduct in similar situations.</p>

          <p>Despite the perception of a rift, President Trump's Middle East tour has advanced policies aligned with Israeli interests, presenting a strategic opportunity for Israel to shape regional events. Trump's emphasis on shared priorities, such as condemning Hamas, urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran, reflects Israeli objectives. Experts suggest Israel must seize this moment to proactively influence regional dynamics, particularly regarding normalization with Saudi Arabia and addressing challenges in Syria, rather than merely reacting to external developments.</p>

          <p>As the NBA draft combine concludes, the Los Angeles Lakers should focus on selecting a big man who is also a mature, experienced player capable of handling the pressures of fame and money. Given the league's economic shifts and the advent of NIL deals in college sports, drafting a player who has spent four years in college and demonstrated resilience and sound decision-making is crucial.

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the Trump administration's ability to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act. The justices sent the case back to a lower court to consider whether the law can be used to deport the immigrants, directing it to examine claims by the migrants that they could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act, the centuries-old wartime law invoked by the Trump administration. The justices said the appeals court should also examine what kind of notice the government should be required to provide that would allow migrants the opportunity to challenge their deportations.</p>
