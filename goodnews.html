          <p>The Las Vegas Aces clinched an 89-86 victory against the Phoenix Mercury in a dramatic Game 1 of the WNBA finals, overcoming a late deficit with a strong fourth-quarter performance led by A'ja Wilson and Dana Evans. This intense opener was overshadowed by significant off-court tension, as WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed player unrest. Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier, a players' union vice-president, had publicly criticized Engelbert for allegedly dismissing concerns about pay and officiating, claiming the league's leadership was "the worst in the world." While Engelbert refuted these specific accounts, she conceded the necessity of rebuilding trust with players, especially with the collective bargaining agreement nearing its expiration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering minting a new one-dollar coin for the nation's 250th anniversary, featuring an image of President Donald Trump. A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, depicts Trump's face on one side and him pumping his fist after a 2014 near-assassination on the reverse, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." This initiative is enabled by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. However, existing provisions, like the Thayer Amendment, typically prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, raising questions about the legality of the proposed design.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its agreement to several components of President Trump's Gaza ceasefire deal, notably the demand for the release of all hostages, while suggesting other details require negotiation. U.S. officials view Hamas's response as positive, with discussions on specifics like weapons decommissioning potentially starting soon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously agreed to the deal, and following Hamas's statement, Israel is preparing to implement the first phase for hostage release. Trump urged Israel to cease bombing Gaza for safe hostage retrieval, expressing belief that Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE," marking a significant step toward ending the conflict.</p>

A notable example is a Guangzhou firm's cancer drug, ivonescimab, which demonstrated superior efficacy in delaying non-small-cell lung cancer progression compared to a leading global medicine. While this success highlights China's growing prowess, experts and analysts question the sustainability of such breakthroughs and the sector's ability to deliver truly novel advancements, especially within a highly complex and regulated industry. Nevertheless, the country is rapidly expanding its pipeline of novel drugs, ranking second globally in development.</p>

          <p>Scientists are making significant strides in biocomputing, aiming to create computers powered by living human cells, a concept they term "wetware." Researchers, like those at FinalSpark lab in Switzerland, are developing clusters of neurons called organoids from stem cells, which can be attached to electrodes to process simple commands. The long-term vision is to create data centers with "living" servers that mimic AI learning, using a fraction of current energy. Challenges remain, particularly in sustaining these organoids beyond a few months, but the research holds promise for neurological drug development and complementing traditional silicon AI, pushing the boundaries of what constitutes a computer.</p>

          <p>An article provides a personal reflection on the dramatic evolution of China's education system, contrasting the author's rural upbringing where "knowledge is power" was a guiding principle, with the current highly competitive urban landscape. The author highlights the immense financial and social pressures faced by modern Chinese families, such as selling apartments to secure spots in top school districts, a stark difference from past generations. This narrative underscores how educational opportunities have transformed from a pathway out of poverty to a complex, often bewildering, system of choices and significant investment for parents seeking the best for their children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London's Soho Square recently hosted a "performative male" contest, a satirical event where men competed by embodying online tropes of empathetic, feminist-aligned masculinity. Contestants, like musician Aiman Kaiden, demonstrated traits such as carrying sanitary pads and feminist literature, sparking discussions among attendees about the sincerity of these displays. Observers noted that while some men might adopt these aesthetics for "female gaze," others believe it signifies a rejection of growing misogynistic ideologies, reflecting a political gap between young men and women. The event highlighted the evolving nature of male identity and social expectations in contemporary culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International brands are intensely revamping their strategies to effectively engage the dynamic and competitive Chinese consumer market, despite China's economic slowdown. Companies like Kraft Heinz are localizing marketing campaigns, while others are dedicating significant revenue to platform-first marketing and product iteration based on local data. The rise of social commerce platforms like Douyin presents both challenges and substantial opportunities, demanding complex strategies beyond simply replicating Western models. Success increasingly hinges on establishing local R&D, developing China-specific products rapidly, and integrating deeply with Chinese culture, moving beyond superficial nods to create meaningful connections with consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark measure allowing over 800,000 rideshare drivers to unionize and negotiate for better wages and benefits, marking a significant expansion of private-sector collective bargaining rights. This legislation is a compromise in the ongoing battle between labor unions and tech companies, following years of disputes over driver classification and benefits. The new law enables drivers to form unions while retaining their independent contractor status, requiring gig companies like Uber and Lyft to bargain in good faith on issues such as earnings and paid leave. In return, Newsom is expected to reduce insurance requirements for these companies, potentially lowering fares.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by almost a third, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT). Combined with plug-in hybrids, electrified vehicles accounted for over half of all new car registrations last month. This surge is attributed to carmaker discounts, increased model choice, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme aimed at encouraging the transition from petrol and diesel cars. While businesses and fleets account for the majority of BEV purchases, private buyer numbers are rising, pushing zero-emission vehicles to over one in five new cars registered in 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent anti-China protests in South Korea, particularly in areas frequented by Chinese travelers, analysts suggest that tourism from China remains largely undeterred. Scheduled flights between the two nations are operating normally, and South Korea continues to be a top destination for Chinese tourists. This resilience is attributed to both governments opposing the protests and the maintenance of public safety. However, experts caution that a potential decline in tourism could still occur if the Chinese embassy were to issue travel warnings, indicating that the situation, while stable for now, remains sensitive to official guidance and diplomatic relations.</p>
