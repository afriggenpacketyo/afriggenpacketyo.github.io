          <p>China's retail sales in May experienced a significant 6.4% year-on-year increase, exceeding analyst predictions and marking the fastest growth since late 2023.  This surge was partly attributed to holidays and government initiatives stimulating consumer spending. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8%, slightly below expectations, and fixed-asset investment also underperformed forecasts.  The urban unemployment rate decreased to 5.0%, its lowest point since November 2024. (not investment advice)</p>
