          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its cautious approach as it evaluates the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and improvements in business and consumer sentiment, while also acknowledging that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection, for HIV prevention, hailed as a potential 'breakthrough' in curbing the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data indicated that the injection provides near-complete protection against HIV infection. The treatment offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada, which faces adherence challenges. However, the high cost of approximately $28,000 a year could limit access, especially in countries with a high HIV burden, despite efforts by Gilead to broaden access through licensing agreements and at-cost provisions.</p>

The trial garnered significant public attention, resulting in an upcoming Netflix documentary. Outside the courthouse, supporters chanted "Free Karen Read" and expressed their support, while Read thanked them and stated that no one has fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than she has. Read will avoid jail time due to a one-year probation order for the intoxication charge.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration approved Gilead's twice-yearly antiviral injection, lenacapavir, for preventing HIV. This approval marks a significant milestone that could help bring the world closer to ending the decades-long epidemic caused by the virus. The injection, to be marketed as Yeztugo, has demonstrated the ability to virtually eliminate new HIV infections when taken every six months. However, the launch faces potential threats, including proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts. Despite its high price tag, Gilead plans to offer assistance programs and has granted licenses for generic production in lower-income countries.</p>

          <p>Experts assess the potential risks of radiation contamination if the U.S. were to use a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. Fordo processes uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas molecule unlikely to travel far. Experts believe any contamination would likely remain localized to the site. Although uranium isotopes are at the low end of hazard for radioactive materials, uranium hexafluoride gas can react with water to form hydrofluoric acid, an acutely hazardous material. The underground location of the facility would likely inhibit any significant environmental release.</p>
