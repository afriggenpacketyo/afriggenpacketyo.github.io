          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will now block artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move aimed at protecting content creators. Website owners using Cloudflare's services will have to opt-in to allow AI bots to access their content for training models. The company stated this change is designed to restore power to publishers who are losing traffic and ad revenue as AI models generate answers without directing users to original sources. This policy shift could significantly impact how AI companies like OpenAI and Google train their large language models.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the successful New York City Democratic mayoral primary campaign of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, suggesting the national Democratic party could learn from his approach. It highlights his practical platform focused on affordability, such as rent freezes and free childcare, which resonated with voters. Mamdani's moral consistency on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite political attacks, is presented as a strength rather than a liability. The campaign's success is attributed to a powerful grassroots volunteer movement that overcame significant spending by opposition Super PACs, demonstrating that people can overpower money in politics.</p>

          <p>China has introduced new tax incentives aimed at encouraging foreign companies to reinvest their profits within the country. The policy allows foreign firms to deduct 10% of their reinvested amount from their onshore taxes, with unused credits carrying forward until the end of2028. This move is part of a broader strategy to boost foreign investor confidence and signal economic openness amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States and the European Union. The incentives, announced by several government ministries, can be applied retroactively to qualifying reinvestments made since the beginning of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California is exploring a systemwide shift from the quarter calendar to the semester system, a move that would align all its undergraduate campuses. Currently, only UC Berkeley and UC Merced operate on semesters, while the other seven use quarters. Proponents argue a common calendar would streamline transfers, joint programs, and access to internships, but critics raise concerns about the significant cost, estimated between $288 million and $371 million. The potential change has sparked debate among faculty and students, who weigh the benefits of standardization against the financial costs and potential disruption to curriculum and student performance.</p>

          <p>Ornithologists from UCLA and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County are recruiting volunteers for Project Phoenix, a citizen science initiative studying how birds respond to wildfire smoke. The project asks residents in California, Oregon, and Washington to spend ten minutes each week observing birds in a familiar location and logging their findings on the eBird platform. Researchers aim to use this data to understand how soot and poor air quality affect bird behavior, location, and health. The program welcomes participants of all experience levels to contribute valuable data for this understudied aspect of wildfire season.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates a significant rise in entrepreneurship within the LGBTQ+ community, with 10% of new business owners in the past year identifying as LGBTQ+. This figure represents a 50% increase from 2023 and brings the rate of new business creation to parity with the general population for the first time. Many of these entrepreneurs are motivated by a desire to create inclusive spaces and be a positive influence in their communities.

These efforts, which include convincing nearby oil and gas operations to adopt better lighting, are crucial for both scientific research and the region's tourism-based economy.

While services inflation saw a slight uptick, the overall figure has fueled expectations that the ECB will hold interest rates steady in its upcoming July meeting.

          <p>Energy bills for approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to fall by 7% as the new price cap from regulator Ofgem takes effect. For a typical household, this translates to a reduction of about ¬£11 per month. While the cut is welcome, analysts caution that prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and future costs are uncertain, with only a small additional drop forecast for the winter. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to shop around for fixed-rate deals to gain more certainty over their energy payments for the colder months ahead.</p>

          <p>State lawmakers in California and across the U.S. are introducing legislation to address a significant gap in medical training regarding menopause. Many people experiencing symptoms report unresponsive doctors, which is unsurprising as a recent study found that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training. California's proposed AB 432 would require menopause coursework for medical license renewal for certain doctors. This legislative trend, seen in over a dozen states, aims to improve patient care by ensuring physicians are better equipped to diagnose and treat menopause-related health issues.</p>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission shows a shift in how Americans voted in the 2024 election. While voting by mail decreased from its 2020 pandemic peak, it remained more popular than in pre-pandemic elections, accounting for 30.3% of ballots. The most notable trend was the rise of in-person early voting, with a majority of ballots being cast in person either before or on Election Day. For the first time, every state offered some form of in-person voting before Election Day, indicating a growing preference for this convenient and secure method.</p>
