          <p>Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has publicly predicted that his son, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, will get an opportunity to start for the Cleveland Browns at some point during the current NFL season. Despite Shedeur being third on the depth chart behind veterans Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, his father advised him to remain patient and prepared for his chance. Deion Sanders also confirmed that other teams, including the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles, showed interest in his son during the draft, but Shedeur was keen to avoid a long-term backup role.</p>

          <p>India is launching an ambitious $18.2 billion "Semiconductor Mission" to build a complete domestic chip supply chain, from design to manufacturing and packaging. The initiative aims to reduce reliance on imports and capture a larger share of the global electronics market as it shifts away from China. While the government has approved ten major projects, including fabrication plants with partners like Taiwan's Powerchip, experts caution that significant challenges remain. Overcoming fierce competition, developing a robust ecosystem, and strengthening infrastructure and intellectual property laws will be critical for India's success in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has called for the government to offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research funding was cut by the Trump administration. In a speech, he proposed a fellowship scheme to attract these researchers, positioning the UK as a leader in scientific advancement if the U.S. continues its "anti-science agenda." This move is part of a broader criticism by Davey against President Trump and his allies, aiming to champion scientific research and global collaboration in the fight against cancer.</p>

The company will invest nearly $200 million in the project, which is expected to create 275 high-quality jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The plant, slated to become operational in 2027, will focus on producing servo-hydraulic actuation systems for aircraft flight controls, initially supplying spoiler actuation systems for the Airbus A350.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a leading Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, initially withdrew from a WABC-TV town hall to protest parent company Disney's suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. He cited the need to stand up for free speech against pressure from the Trump administration. After Disney announced Kimmel's show would return, Mamdani confirmed he would reschedule his appearance, calling the reinstatement a "victory for free speech." The move drew criticism from political opponents, who accused him of avoiding difficult questions from the press on other campaign issues.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the late-night show was suspended indefinitely. The company stated the suspension was intended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation" following comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Disney said the decision to reinstate the show came after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The suspension had sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from First Amendment advocates, Hollywood figures, and even some Republican lawmakers.</p>

          <p>NHS England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, who died from cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to take further action, such as ordering more tests or seeking a second opinion, to prevent avoidable deaths. This initiative aims to standardize best practices and improve early detection of serious illnesses, particularly in younger patients whose symptoms may be overlooked.</p>
