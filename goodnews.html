          <h2>Kayem Foods Recalls Chicken Sausage Due to Potential Plastic Contamination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:21:07 EDT</div>

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. has issued a recall for more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand ready-to-eat chicken sausage products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the recall after the company received three consumer complaints about finding pieces of white plastic in the food. The affected sweet apple chicken sausage packages were produced on June 28 and distributed nationwide. While no injuries have been reported, consumers are advised to either discard the products or return them to the place of purchase for a refund.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would be financially beneficial for Manchester United as they look to manage their wage bill. Rashford, one of the club's highest-paid players, has been training separately from the first team amid a standoff with head coach Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa and has not been assigned a squad number for the upcoming season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese authorities have vowed to strengthen enforcement against the smuggling of strategic minerals, stating the situation remains "severe." Following a special operation launched in May that resulted in multiple arrests, officials plan to establish a joint enforcement center for export controls on dual-use items. The government noted that some offenders collude with foreign entities and use increasingly covert tactics, such as false declarations and transshipment through third countries, to illegally export the materials. The crackdown aims to prevent the outflow of critical minerals and related technologies, which are vital for national security and high-tech industries.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile visit to China, signaling a potential easing of Sino-US trade tensions. During his trip to the China International Supply Chain Expo, Huang announced that Washington had approved the export of Nvidia's H20 AI chip, a less powerful model designed specifically for the Chinese market. This development follows an agreement between the two nations on a trade negotiation framework and approvals for certain technology exports. Huang's charm offensive and the strong presence of US firms at the expo reflect a recent thaw, though underlying concerns about the broader trade war persist.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims That Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>

          <p>A DW fact check addresses and refutes social media claims that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The article explores reasons for the myth's persistence, including the rising number of diagnosed cases due to better awareness and detection. It also notes that while sunscreen sales are increasing, many people use it inconsistently or only on vacation, and older studies may have used less effective products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a payment processing company whose stock has fallen significantly. The move follows Global Payments' poorly received acquisition of Worldpay, a deal that investors criticized for its high price and questionable strategic fit. Elliott's involvement is seen as a potential catalyst for change, as the firm could push for a reconstituted board to enhance oversight, restore investor confidence, and ensure accountability during the integration of the large acquisition. This intervention aims to help the company execute its new strategy more effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Australian Wallabies 27-19 in the opening Test of their series in Brisbane, taking a 1-0 lead. The Lions established a commanding 24-5 lead early in the second half through tries from Sione Tuipulotu, Tom Curry, and Dan Sheehan, appearing dominant in the first 50 minutes. However, the team's performance faltered in the final half-hour, allowing the Wallabies to score two late tries and narrow the margin significantly. While the Lions secured the victory, the late-game lapse in discipline and accuracy left a sense of confusion and suggests areas for improvement.</p>

          <p>A summer camp for individuals with disabilities, located 30 miles downstream from the fatal Camp Mystic flood site, has reopened thanks to a massive volunteer cleanup effort. After the Guadalupe River floods destroyed its waterfront and amenities, a social media plea for help drew hundreds of volunteers from across Texas. They brought equipment and supplies, clearing debris and rebuilding the facilities in a herculean effort over several days. The reopening of Camp Camp, which serves over 800 campers annually, has been described as a testament to community spirit in the midst of widespread tragedy.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle from working out received a shocking diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. Unusually, her cancer did not present with a typical skin mole, making the initial discovery difficult. She underwent an aggressive treatment protocol combining radiation with two immunotherapy drugs, which caused severe side effects but has led to what her doctor calls a "miraculous" improvement. After 18 months of treatment, her cancer has not progressed, and she is now mentoring other patients.</p>

          <p>Over the 25 years since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), China's relationship with the continent has seen "leapfrog development." Trade has surged nearly 30-fold, and Chinese investment has grown 100-fold, but cooperation has also deepened significantly on the security front. China has become a leading arms supplier to Africa, now training approximately 2,000 African military officers each year. This strategic partnership, encompassing both economic and military ties, has allowed Beijing to increase its influence across the continent, often surpassing traditional partners like the US, Russia, and France.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has taken a significant step toward regulating cryptocurrencies with President Trump signing the "Genius Act" into law, which sets new rules for stablecoins. Passed with bipartisan support, the law mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain full reserves and adhere to anti-money laundering standards. This marks a major victory for the crypto industry, which has lobbied heavily for a clearer regulatory framework. However, critics argue the new rules are too weak and fear that another proposed bill, the CLARITY Act, would shift oversight to a less stringent regulator, potentially exposing consumers to greater risk.
