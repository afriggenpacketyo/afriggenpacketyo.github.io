          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors to an unnamed company. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, has boosted Samsung's share price by over 2%. The company is keeping the counterparty's identity confidential at their request to protect trade secrets. This significant contract comes as Samsung's foundry service, the world's second-largest, has been facing weak orders and struggling to compete in the market for advanced AI chips.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced the success of "Operation Grayskull," an investigation that dismantled four major dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material. The network had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or used the platforms, including a key administrator labeled one of the world's most significant purveyors of such content. Officials are touting the operation as a major victory in the fight against online child exploitation.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimming prodigy Yu Zidi, at just 12 years old, is making headlines at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She is a contender for a medal in the 200m individual medley, which would make her the youngest medalist at a major international event in nearly 90 years. Even if she misses the podium in her first final, she has strong prospects in the 200m butterfly and 400m medley. The young athlete's rapid rise has positioned her as one of the most exciting new talents in the sport.</p>

          <p>The Chinese technology hub of Shenzhen has implemented new rules to grant leniency to researchers and innovators whose state-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that if failures are due to legitimate technical difficulties or market changes, and not misconduct or abuse of power, individuals and units should not be penalized. They will remain eligible for future government funding and will not see their performance evaluations negatively affected. The move is intended to encourage bold exploration and risk-taking in significant scientific and technological endeavors.</p>

          <p>European leaders have reacted to the new trade deal with the United States, which sets a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof expressed relief that a "no-deal" scenario with much higher tariffs was averted, providing stability for businesses. However, they also acknowledged that a zero-tariff arrangement would have been preferable. The agreement, which averts a potential trade war, is seen as a significant compromise that will now require approval from all 27 EU member states.</p>

Estate agents report that a majority of current buyers, largely from the United States, are seeking citizenship, driven by political and social volatility at home. While the programs provide vital revenue for the island economies, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over concerns about security and potential financial crime, prompting the Caribbean nations to bolster oversight.</p>

Archaeologists say the findings, which include brick structures and Tamil Brahmi script dating to 580 BCE, challenge the narrative that civilization and literacy spread from northern to southern India. The discoveries have become a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling a deep-rooted cultural and political divide between India's north and south, with accusations that the federal government is suppressing the findings.</p>

They used its flight logs as crucial evidence to prove the fate of 12 disappeared activists and to secure life sentences for the pilots, bringing the plane back to Argentina as an irrefutable witness to the regime's crimes.</p>
