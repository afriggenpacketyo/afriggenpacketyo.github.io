          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store after a judge ruled that Apple cannot prohibit link-outs or commissions on them, a decision favoring Epic Games. Fortnite was removed from the App Store in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its website. Apple retains the option to reject the resubmission and is appealing the contempt ruling. This ruling has already impacted app development economics, with companies like Amazon and Spotify updating their apps to direct customers to their websites for payments.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly considered raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while simultaneously expressing political reservations about the move. Trump indicated a willingness to accept a small tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but he acknowledged the potential political backlash from Democrats. Trump's comments create further uncertainty for GOP leaders struggling to balance tax cuts with fiscal responsibility. He also referenced George H.W. Bush's broken promise not to raise taxes, suggesting Republicans should avoid a similar scenario, while still being open to the idea.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated a potential reduction in tariffs on China, suggesting a decrease from 145% to 80% before trade negotiations.
