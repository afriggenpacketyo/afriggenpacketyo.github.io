          <p>A study by Waymo analyzed the safety performance of its autonomous vehicles over 56.7 million miles without human safety drivers and compared the data to human driving safety. The study found that Waymo cars had significantly fewer crashes, including 81% fewer airbag-deploying crashes and 85% fewer crashes with suspected serious injuries. Extrapolating the data suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save approximately 34,000 lives per year in the US. The article argues that slowing down autonomous vehicle development is costing lives, despite public concerns about unusual incidents involving self-driving cars.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the human craving for meaningful connection, drawing on reader responses to a project called ‚ÄúBelieving,‚Äù which explores how people find meaning in their lives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony Albanese, Australia's prime minister, secured a landslide re-election victory, partly due to anti-Trump sentiment among voters. While Albanese did not campaign as an anti-Trump figure, Trump's policies and global turmoil influenced the election. Voters, concerned about the cost-of-living crisis, rejected Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, for echoing Trump's ideas. Australians viewed Trump's tariff decisions negatively and were alarmed by market fluctuations tied to his policy announcements, contributing to Dutton's defeat and Albanese's win.</p>
