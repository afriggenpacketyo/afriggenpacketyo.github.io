          <p>Investor Warren Buffett voiced his disapproval of President Trump's use of tariffs as a trade weapon, cautioning that it could alienate other nations. Speaking at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett emphasized the importance of balanced trade but questioned Trump's approach. He highlighted that global safety is enhanced when more countries prosper through trade and cooperation. Buffett also addressed Berkshire's large cash reserves, indicating a lack of attractively priced investments currently, while remaining optimistic about future opportunities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry highlights lifestyle choices that can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia, stroke, and depression. The study indicates that modifiable risk factors account for a substantial portion of these conditions, including 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia cases, and 35% of late-life depression. Experts emphasize the interconnectedness of these conditions, as individuals who have experienced a stroke are more prone to developing depression or dementia, and vice versa. Dr. Sanjula Singh, the lead author, recommends focusing on these lifestyle adjustments for optimal brain health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the six most common worries among children that parents often don't realize, including social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. Children are increasingly concerned about fitting in, navigating social media pressures, and managing the stress of busy routines. Trauma, even from seemingly minor incidents, can significantly impact a child's sense of safety. The therapists emphasize the importance of teaching children coping strategies during calm moments, such as naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, and using affirming phrases, to help them manage intense feelings.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australian Prime Minister, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian leader has achieved this milestone. The Labor Party's victory came as opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's shortcomings during the campaign. Albanese criticized the opposition for adopting "American-style politics" of division, while also highlighting his government's success in improving relations with China. The election took place against a backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis and shifting demographics, with both parties focusing on policies to assist first-home buyers.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a landslide victory in the Australian federal election, defying expectations and leading his center-left Labor Party to a significant increase in its parliamentary majority. The win marks a stunning comeback for Albanese, whose popularity had been at record lows earlier in the year due to economic challenges and political debates. The campaign was dominated by cost-of-living concerns, with Albanese promising to make healthcare and housing more affordable, as well as address climate change and advance reconciliation with First Nations people. Albanese's success represents a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia.</p>

          <p>Several German states are contemplating banning smartphones from classrooms, with one high school in North Rhine-Westphalia already trialing the initiative. The Dalton High School requires students to keep their smartphones turned off and stored in their bags during the school day to minimize distractions. Many teachers support the ban, observing that students are more relaxed and less distracted during lessons. Education researchers also suggest that smartphone bans can reduce cyberbullying and increase social wellbeing among students.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a man who injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of a novel antivenom. Immunologist Jacob Glanville collaborated with Friede to analyze his blood, which contained antibodies effective against several snake neurotoxins. The resulting antivenom, tested in mice, can protect against bites from 19 species of venomous snakes. The research highlights the potential for human-derived antibodies and small-molecule drugs to revolutionize snakebite treatment, offering a more effective and safer alternative to traditional methods.</p>

          <p>The judiciary is emerging as a key source of resistance against President Trump's agenda, as federal judges across the country have ruled against the administration's policies, particularly on immigration. A Trump-appointed judge in Texas deemed the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act "unlawful." Despite the absence or retreat of other institutions that opposed Trump's first term, the legal process has stepped in to challenge executive actions. The judiciary's intervention underscores the importance of institutional checks and balances in a polarized political climate.</p>
