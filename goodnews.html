          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience as employers added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' forecasts and keeping pace with the average monthly gains over the past year. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw a decline. Despite the strong report, economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of the year, with potential economic headwinds from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen for the fifth consecutive week, with the average 30-year fixed rate now at 6.67%, providing a glimmer of hope for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend comes amid market expectations of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut later in the year. For current buyers, this changing landscape presents an opportunity to prepare by checking their credit, researching real estate agents, and securing mortgage pre-approval. Acting now could position them advantageously before a potential influx of new buyers enters the market if rates continue to drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" explores the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film often feels more like a commercial for his global brand than an intimate portrait. The film chronicles his journey from humble beginnings to international fame, featuring celebrity investors like Robert De Niro and fawning testimonials. However, it rarely delves into the complex artistry or communal experience of his cuisine. While showcasing beautifully crafted dishes, the documentary misses the opportunity to fully articulate the disciplined genius and culinary revolution that defined his rise.</p>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21%, many Americans find do-it-yourself payoff plans insufficient for their growing debt. This article outlines five key indicators that it's time to seek professional help, such as only being able to make minimum payments and using credit cards for essential living expenses. Other red flags include having a credit utilization ratio over 50% or a debt-to-income ratio above 40%. When these signs appear, options like credit counseling or debt settlement programs may be necessary to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old American woman who left a stressful, high-paying career in New York City now thrives as a university teacher in Chengdu, China, on a salary of about $30,000. She explains that while this income would be considered poverty level in the U.S., it allows her to "live large" in China, where her cost of living is significantly lower. Working only 18 hours a week, she enjoys benefits like a rent stipend and paid vacations, allowing her to save money and pursue hobbies, something she couldn't do while living paycheck-to-paycheck in New York.</p>
