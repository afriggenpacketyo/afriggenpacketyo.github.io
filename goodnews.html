          <p>SpaceX has once again delayed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, first due to an oxygen leak and then, on the second attempt, by an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. The article emphasizes that a successful flight is critical for increasing launch frequency and demonstrating autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a vital step for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing and future Mars missions. Despite acknowledging "thousands of engineering challenges," particularly with orbital refueling, SpaceX founder Elon Musk remains confident in his team's ability to achieve these ambitious goals. While some NASA experts express skepticism about the 2027 moon landing timeline, SpaceX's history of rapid development and iteration provides a basis for optimism in overcoming these significant technical hurdles.</p>

          <p>Hangzhou, a prominent Chinese city, has implemented compulsory artificial intelligence (AI) classes across its schools, aligning with a broader national strategy to build a robust talent pipeline and improve educators' proficiency in smart tools and data protection. The article highlights that the city's education bureau has provided flexible guidelines, allowing schools to either concentrate AI lessons within a single week or integrate the content into existing subjects like information technology and science. This initiative aims to introduce primary students to daily AI applications and basic devices, while also stressing the critical importance of responsible technology use and privacy. The curriculum supports both foundational learning and advanced project-based studies for interested students.</p>

          <p>Following a multi-state lawsuit, the Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in congressionally allocated education funding that was previously withheld from U.S. schools. The article highlights that these vital funds, designated for a range of educational services including after-school and summer learning, teacher training, and support for English-learners, were frozen just weeks before the school year began, causing widespread uncertainty. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who spearheaded the lawsuit alongside 22 other states, lauded the agreement, asserting that the administration had illegally impounded the money. This restoration is crucial for sustaining programs that benefit approximately 1.4 million children nationwide, with a particular impact on low-income families.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully halted a brush fire that rapidly scorched approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek, on Monday afternoon. The article highlights that while the fire's forward progression was stopped, achieving full containment will necessitate extended operations into the early evening, involving heavy equipment to extinguish burned material along control lines. No injuries were reported, but fire officials have warned of significant potential delays on the 405 Freeway, urging the public to use alternate routes. This fire and subsequent traffic concerns occur amidst an ongoing $143.7 million repavement project on the 405, which already includes a series of overnight road closures, exacerbating traffic challenges in the region.</p>

          <p>Korean Air and Boeing announced a deal for 103 new passenger jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models, hours after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with Donald Trump in Washington. The article notes that this significant purchase aligns with Trump's pressure on trading partners to increase business with American firms, and it will modernize Korean Air's fleet as it merges with Asiana Airlines. Boeing hailed the "landmark agreement" for supporting approximately 135,000 jobs across the U.S. This deal is part of a trend where several countries negotiating trade agreements with the Trump administration have announced substantial Boeing orders, contributing to Boeing's sales surpassing those of its European rival, Airbus.

          <p>India's "Garbage Cafes" are garnering significant praise for their innovative dual approach to combating both poverty and rampant plastic pollution, by offering full meals in exchange for collected plastic waste. The article details how patrons can receive a comprehensive meal, including rice and curries, for 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of plastic, or breakfast for half that amount. Since the first cafe opened in Ambikapur in 2019, the initiative has successfully diverted 23 metric tons of plastic waste, drastically reducing landfill contributions. For impoverished residents like Rashmi Mondal, who previously earned meager sums from selling plastic debris, these cafes provide vital food security, profoundly improving their lives while simultaneously contributing to a cleaner environment and fostering a circular economy.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a doctor and BBC presenter, challenges conventional wisdom on posture, asserting that rigidly holding oneself upright can be more harmful than beneficial for back health. The article presents his three crucial rules for improving posture: emphasizing constant movement rather than static positions, building core and back strength through exercises like pilates or yoga, and adopting a positive mindset by addressing stress and work-life balance. He explains that posture is dynamic and significantly influenced by emotional and psychological well-being, not solely by physical alignment. These guidelines advocate for regular movement, targeted strength training, and stress management as essential, holistic components for maintaining a healthy and pain-free back.</p>

Despite the Home Secretary's firm commitment to facilitating their arrival, substantial logistical hurdles persist, notably securing Israel's permission for each student to exit and conducting necessary visa biometric checks in a third country. This humanitarian effort follows months of advocacy by politicians and academics, and similar student evacuations by other European nations.</p>
