          <p>Michelle Obama has addressed her daughter Malia's decision to use her middle name, Ann, professionally, noting that she and Barack Obama respect their daughters' desire to establish their own identities. Malia Obama chose to omit "Obama" from the credits of her short film, "The Heart," which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Michelle Obama emphasized the importance of her daughters feeling like they earn their accomplishments and not simply being handed opportunities due to their parents' status. She added that both Malia and Sasha now have a better understanding of their parents' principles and decisions during their time in the White House.</p>

          <p>Despite securing an exemption from 50% tariffs, Britain still faces a 25% duty on steel due to the absence of a finalized trade agreement with the United States. President Trump has increased tariffs on foreign metals, impacting various countries differently. While Britain benefits from a partial carve-out, European nations are subject to the doubled tariff rate, increasing economic pressure. The situation highlights the complexities of international trade relations and the impact of tariffs on specific regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the potential for HELOC interest rates to fluctuate following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. While a rate cut in June is unlikely, comments made by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell after the meeting could influence HELOC rates. If Powell indicates an imminent rate reduction, lenders may preemptively lower HELOC rates, while hawkish comments could lead to slight upward movement. Borrowers should consider both HELOCs and home equity loans, weighing the variable rate of HELOCs against the fixed rate of home equity loans, to determine the best option for their financial situation.

          <p>This Vox article explores the ongoing debate about women in combat roles, featuring Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School. The article discusses the historical barriers women faced and the policy changes that opened combat jobs to them. It also addresses concerns raised by figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who insists standards were lowered for women in combat roles. Vanasse refutes these claims, emphasizing that she met the same standards as men and that lethality involves more than just physical fitness. The article presents a nuanced perspective on the capabilities and experiences of women in the military.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale evacuation in Cologne, Germany, has been lifted after experts successfully defused three World War II bombs. Approximately 20,000 residents were ordered to evacuate the city center, including the old town, hotels, care homes, and railway stations. The defusal operation was temporarily delayed due to a resident's refusal to evacuate, but authorities eventually cleared the area. The discovery of the bombs highlights Cologne's history as a major bombing target during World War II, with bomb defusals being a common occurrence.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require American medical schools to include nutrition courses in their curriculum or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy believes that aspiring physicians should be taught how to treat illnesses with food and prevent diseases through proper nutrition. While some medical schools claim to already offer sufficient nutrition education, experts argue for a consistent set of standards and more comprehensive training. The move aims to address chronic disease rates and shift the focus from medication to preventative care.</p>

          <p>This article explains the five-year rule for annuities, an IRS regulation affecting how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from inherited annuities. The rule requires that the entire value of the annuity be distributed within five years of the original owner's death. It primarily applies to non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax dollars. The article advises annuity owners to plan for their beneficiaries and for beneficiaries to make elections early to avoid potential tax traps. (not investment advice)</p>
