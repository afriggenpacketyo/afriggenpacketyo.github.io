          <p>President Donald Trump is considering nearly a dozen candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve. The list includes a diverse group of current and former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, many of whom advocate for lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Key figures like former Governor Kevin Warsh have called for significant changes, while others emphasize the need for greater transparency and intellectual diversity within the Federal Open Market Committee. The selection comes at a critical time for U.S. monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has described the potential government intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The move aims to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor. While unconventional for a capitalist economy, proponents argue that ensuring domestic production of critical technology is vital, comparing it to the necessity of controlling the manufacturing of military hardware. The administration is reportedly considering using funds from the CHIPS Act for the investment.</p>

          <p>Researchers have released detailed images of "The Northumberland," a Stuart-era warship that sank off the coast of Kent, England, during the Great Storm of 1703. The dive revealed an extensive hull structure, cannons, and wooden chests, some still containing musketballs, all preserved by marine sediment. Experts from Historic England caution that the wreck's condition is fragile, as shifting sands that currently protect it could expose it to rapid deterioration. The find offers significant potential for understanding naval history from that period.</p>

The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly, and officials later stated that the situation was controlled without incident and posed no remaining threat to the public. Preliminary tests on the substance found nothing dangerous, though samples are being sent to the FBI's lab in Quantico for further analysis. The incident prompted a temporary shelter-in-place for some individuals as a safety precaution.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to borrow $100,000 against their property face a choice between a home equity loan with a fixed rate and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) with a variable rate. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates in September, HELOCs may become the cheaper option, as their variable rates are better positioned to decline with the market. Currently, average rates for both products are in the 8% range, with HELOCs being slightly lower. The article advises borrowers to consider not just potential rate changes but also their comfort with a variable payment versus the predictability of a fixed-rate loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team at Tianjin University in China has created a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram, more than double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells. The team has established a pilot production line for the battery, which could dramatically increase the range of electric vehicles and drones, potentially eliminating "range anxiety" for consumers. Published in the journal Nature, the research also highlights the battery's superior stability, having shown resilience in tests against fire, low temperatures, and punctures. This breakthrough surpasses China's national goals for battery technology development.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive survey of Germany's Lake Constance has uncovered 31 shipwrecks, offering a new window into the region's maritime history. Among the discoveries are two large paddle steamers, one of which is believed to be the SD Friedrichshafen II, destroyed in a World War II air raid. Another significant find is a nearly intact cargo sailing ship with its mast still standing, a rarity in underwater archaeology. The project used advanced sonar and remotely operated vehicles to investigate anomalies on the lakebed, documenting the culturally significant sites for preservation and research.</p>

This trend is partly driven by universities' financial struggles, as a decline in higher-paying international students has made them more eager to enroll domestic undergraduates for stability, even those who slightly missed their grades. While this is positive news for students, it highlights underlying financial pressures on the higher education sector. The situation has also led to a competitive "Clearing" process, with some universities offering cash incentives to fill remaining spots.</p>

While the percentage gain is large, the average dollar amount of equity, at $35,931, remains among the lowest in the country.

While the technology promises to reduce reliance on expensive diesel and unreliable electricity grids, widespread adoption faces economic hurdles.

In an era dominated by technological advancements like artificial intelligence, which many of these students are developing, they are choosing to devote time to the ancient art of poetry. The essay suggests this pursuit stems from a fundamental human need for connection, surprise, and the preservation of complex inner lives—qualities that poetry offers but which large language models cannot replicate. This embrace of the humanities within a premier tech institution highlights poetry's enduring role as a technology for memory and human connection.</p>
