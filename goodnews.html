          <p>The article explores the concept of 'energy vampires' in friendships, individuals who deplete one's emotional and mental reserves through constant self-absorption, complaints, or a lack of genuine interest. Psychologists and journalists highlight common signs, such as an excessive need for attention or subtle mood-chipping comments. Practical advice includes engaging in honest conversations to express feelings, establishing clear boundaries to protect personal space, and altering shared activities to prevent their dominance. The goal is to safeguard one's well-being while navigating challenging social dynamics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:30:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CM Energy President Wang Yongxin emphasized that developing a reliable green methanol supply chain is crucial for Hong Kong to achieve its goals in sustainable marine fuels. While liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations are already established, securing tax-free mainland-produced methanol is essential for future growth. The company's new dual-fuel vessel, CM Hong Kong, currently uses a quarter green methanol, which is significantly more expensive than traditional fuels. However, increased usage is projected from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariff regime.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity, led by President Maia Sandu, achieved a significant parliamentary majority in an election overshadowed by claims of 'massive Russian interference.' With nearly all votes counted, Sandu's party secured close to 50%, far surpassing the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc. Despite reports of bomb scares and alleged plots for post-election unrest, the outcome reinforces Moldova's commitment to its path towards European Union integration. The pro-Russian opposition leader, Igor Dodon, disputed the results and called for protests, highlighting the country's ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rising while Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix saw declines after a recent record high. South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq, however, posted gains. The Reserve Bank of Australia commenced its two-day policy meeting, where it is largely expected to maintain its cash rate at 3.6%. Analysts note building tension in economic data, citing upside risks to Q3 inflation alongside signs of moderating employment and wage growth. This follows a rally in U.S. markets that ended a three-day losing streak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dana White's entrepreneurial vision transformed the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) from an unprofitable, unsanctioned sport into a global phenomenon now valued at over $15 billion. White's blend of personality and risk-taking was instrumental, beginning with his friends' $2 million acquisition of the struggling league. Early support came from Donald Trump, who hosted the UFC's first major event at the Taj Mahal. The organization's exponential growth, fueled by a reality series and electrifying matchups, led to a $4 billion sale and a recent $7.7 billion media rights deal with Paramount, solidifying its mainstream status.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its historic windmills, plans to implement a €17.50 entry fee for tourists starting next spring. This measure aims to combat overtourism, as the village, with a population of just 100, received 2.6 million visitors last year, leading to privacy intrusions for residents. The fee will include admission to the museum and windmills, with anticipated revenues funding maintenance and new infrastructure. While some tourists find the cost steep, others support the initiative to preserve the village's unique charm.</p>
