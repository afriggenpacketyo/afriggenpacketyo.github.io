          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a 90-second radar and communication outage, prompting renewed concerns about the airport's aging infrastructure. This incident, similar to a previous outage, occurred despite Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's recent announcement of a modernization plan. Controllers were unable to communicate with aircraft during the outage, highlighting the urgent need for technological upgrades. Federal officials are working to address the technical issues and plan to install new fiber optic cables to prevent future disruptions, with a goal to fully upgrade the system by summer. The incident underscores the challenges faced by one of the nation's busiest airports and the importance of investing in air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Digital advertising market results for the past quarter showed strength for tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, but executives are expressing caution about the rest of the year due to President Trump's trade war. While companies like Amazon, Reddit, and Snap also posted strong sales, concerns are rising about slower, Asia-specific ad sales and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Meta CFO Susan Li noted reduced spending from "Asia-based e-commerce exporters" due to trade policy changes. The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green acknowledged the challenging economy, indicating that marketers face an "important time" amid increased macro volatility.</p>

          <p>Home equity loans are presented as a relatively inexpensive way to borrow money, particularly for large sums, due to the home serving as collateral.

Sotomayor remembered Souter as a man of honor who served the Court with great distinction, and other justices also shared tributes to his kindness and modesty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio is no longer sufficient for long-term retirement planning due to increasing lifespans. Edelman suggests that investors should allocate 70% to 80% of their portfolios to equities to ensure they do not outlive their savings. He emphasizes that advancements in health and science will lead to humans routinely living to 100 and beyond, requiring more aggressive investment strategies. This perspective challenges conventional wisdom, advocating for a shift towards greater equity exposure to address the financial implications of increased longevity.</p>

          <p>South Africa has criticized the United States following reports that Washington may accept white Afrikaners as refugees, describing the move as "politically motivated." The South African foreign ministry stated that allegations of discrimination against the country's white minority are unfounded. The US state department says they are interviewing individuals interested in resettling in the US, and prioritizing "Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination", but would not confirm when the resettlement would begin. The Trump administration has also accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, something Pretoria has repeatedly denied.</p>
