          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton, originally a Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now publicly rooting against them in the NLCS. His change of allegiance stems from an alleged snub in summer 2024, when the Brewers reportedly canceled his ceremonial first pitch after the Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. Haliburton, who grew up near Milwaukee, has been seen wearing jerseys of teams playing against the Brewers, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers. He declared himself a "free agent" as a baseball fan following the incident.</p>

          <p>Writer John T. Edge, known for his work on Southern food and culture, has released a new memoir, "House of Smoke," exploring his own troubled family history and Southern identity. The article highlights Edge's shift from external storytelling to confronting his upbringing in rural Georgia, including his mother's struggles with alcoholism. His memoir recounts shedding the "Lost Cause" mythology and his efforts to redefine the South. Edge, who previously led the Southern Foodways Alliance, now directs a writers' retreat at William Faulkner's former farm, aiming to foster future literary talent.</p>

Several other Lakers players, including Gabe Vincent and Rui Hachimura, will be sidelined for Tuesday's game due to a demanding back-to-back schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that a sharp slowdown in hiring presents a growing risk to the U.S. economy, suggesting the central bank will likely implement two more interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics, Powell noted that despite a government shutdown impacting data, the employment outlook remains a key concern. Lower rates aim to reduce borrowing costs, stimulating business expansion and hiring. Powell also hinted at potentially halting the reduction of the Fed's bond holdings, a move criticized by some for its impact on inequality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The City of Foley, Alabama, has approved the purchase of over two acres of property on East Violet Avenue, with plans for a new civic center or a museum. Mayor Ralph Hellmich stated the current civic center, built in the 1970s, no longer meets the city's needs, necessitating a larger facility capable of holding around 800 people. The museum would commemorate Foley's designation as an American World War II Heritage City, highlighting its involvement with naval aviation during the war. An additional parcel of land was also donated by the property owners.</p>
