          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet that had been lost 11 years ago by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan. The wallet was found lodged under the hood of a 2015 Ford Edge while the mechanic was replacing cooling fans. Inside, he found the employee's ID and used Facebook to track down the owner, Richard Guilford, who had lost it in 2014 when it slipped out of his pocket while he worked on the vehicle. The wallet, which traveled over 150,000 miles inside the car, still contained $15 in cash and $250 in Cabela's gift cards, which the store confirmed are still valid.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese design proposes a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees during flight. This innovative "scissor wing" concept, once explored by NASA, aims to optimize performance across different speed regimes. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at transonic speeds it pivots to 45 degrees to mitigate shock waves. For hypersonic flight at Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider" to handle the extreme conditions of high-speed travel.</p>

          <p>A New Zealand citizen, Sarah Shaw, and her 6-year-old son have been released after being held in a U.S. immigration detention center in Texas for over three weeks. Shaw, who has lived legally in the U.S. since 2021, was detained while re-entering from Canada due to an expired travel permit, a mistake her lawyer described as a minor administrative error. Despite her son's documents being valid, both were transported nearly 2,000 miles from their Washington state home to the detention facility. The case highlights the strict enforcement of immigration policies, which has led to the detention of lawful residents over paperwork issues.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned island property in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation. The historic fort, once built to defend against French naval attacks, had been empty for 17 years and lacked basic utilities. Now fully modernized, it features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub, offering a unique off-grid experience with no neighbors to disturb.</p>

          <p>With food prices continuing to rise, parents across the UK are sharing creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week school summer holidays. Meticulous planning and resourcefulness are key, with tactics including stocking freezers with discounted "yellow-sticker" items and batch cooking meals. Some parents portion out food for each day to prevent snacks from disappearing too quickly, while others meticulously organize their fridge by use-by dates to minimize waste. These efforts come as many families struggle with increased costs for rent and childcare, making the loss of subsidized school meals a significant financial burden.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, who are about to receive their GCSE results, have opened time capsule letters they wrote to themselves as 11-year-olds in March 2021. The letters were written just as they returned to school after a major COVID-19 lockdown, capturing their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. The exercise was designed by their teacher to instill self-belief during a uniquely disruptive period that shaped their entire secondary school education. Four years later, the students reflected on their younger selves' questions about girlfriends, dreams of attending university, and hopes for a post-pandemic world.</p>
