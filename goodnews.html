These changes aim to align North America with the rest of the world, where total ticket prices are already displayed upfront.

          <p>Cambodia recently allowed warships from multiple nations, including Vietnam, Japan, and Russia, to access its Ream naval base in an effort to demonstrate its neutrality and dispel perceptions of being solely a Chinese outpost.

During his visits, Xi emphasized China's commitment to resisting external "unilateral bullying" and safeguarding the shared Asian home. For China's vision of lasting trust to materialize, it must prioritize openness, consistency, and multilateral dialogue in its interactions with ASEAN countries. </p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate since 2014, driven by a recovering oil and gas sector and strong growth in technology and finance.

However, these reforms have resulted in a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with nearly half the population living in poverty. Inflation is expected to remain high, and the agriculture sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs. </p>

          <p>Food delivery drivers in China are increasingly relying on discounted "loving meals" (aixincan) offered by some restaurants in major cities. These meals provide affordable sustenance for migrant workers facing economic pressures. The movement, which can be traced back to the early 2000s, aims to help people in need without questions asked. The availability of discounted meals reflects a shift in China's urban landscape, where traditional support networks for migrant workers have diminished. </p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors such as unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical instability, and fears of inflation. While gold is often seen as a safe haven asset, its price is not immune to fluctuations, and past surges have been followed by significant falls. Central banks are increasingly buying gold to diversify their reserves, partly due to fears of weaponization of the dollar system. Experts are divided on whether the upward trend will continue, with some forecasting further price increases and others warning of a potential market bubble. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The focus on weight loss alone should not be the primary goal for doctors and patients when considering GLP-1 drugs; instead, the emphasis should be on improving overall health by reducing visceral fat. Visceral fat, which accumulates around the waist and organs, is linked to numerous chronic diseases. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat and improving metabolic health, making them most beneficial for individuals with excess visceral fat already suffering its consequences. Doctors need better ways to identify these individuals, as BMI is a poor measure, and must consider the long-term implications and unanswered questions surrounding GLP-1 use. </p>
