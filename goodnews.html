          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized that Southeast Asian countries can shape their own destiny amidst the intensifying US-China competition. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, Wong stated that Asean aims to be an inclusive arena where both the US and China are actively engaged. The region seeks to reject zero-sum competition and embrace engagement with various major powers for shared prosperity. Southeast Asia values both the US as its biggest investor and China as its largest trading partner, seeking balanced relationships with both nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are stuck in a holding pattern, with economic uncertainty and military conflicts having little impact on movement. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly, remaining in a narrow range around 7%. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped slightly, while refinance applications rose. The lack of movement in rates offers little incentive to homebuyers facing high house prices and low supply, and the average loan size for purchase applications has declined to its lowest level since January.

The Clippers, with the last pick in the first round, will also be looking for the best player available, with mock drafts suggesting they may select Noah Penda, a forward from France. Both teams will continue building their teams through free agency and trades, focusing on the contract statuses of key players like LeBron James and Luka Doncic.</p>
