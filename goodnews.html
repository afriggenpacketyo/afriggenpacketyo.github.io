          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:25:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw a significant drop, falling to its lowest point since October of the previous year. This decline, the largest in over a year, was a direct reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which eased concerns about inflationary pressures. For potential homebuyers, this rate reduction could translate into considerable monthly savings, potentially reigniting a housing market that has been sluggish. However, it remains uncertain if this drop will be substantial enough to overcome persistent affordability challenges and draw buyers back in large numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed an antitrust lawsuit filed by Newsmax against Fox News, though the outlet has been given an opportunity to submit an amended complaint. The suit, which accused Fox News of monopolistic practices to suppress conservative media competitors, was dismissed on procedural grounds as an impermissible "shotgun complaint." Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the complaint improperly incorporated all allegations from the first count into subsequent ones. Newsmax has stated it considers this a technical matter and intends to refile the lawsuit in compliance with the judge's order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging government reshuffle. Rather than simply filling the vacant positions, Starmer has recast his top team, appointing new individuals to major offices like Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. This move is seen as an attempt to seize control of the political narrative and re-energize a government facing declining approval ratings and a resurgent Reform UK party. The reshuffle is a significant exercise of prime ministerial authority, aimed at demonstrating a focus on delivery and stability after a turbulent period.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has dropped a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, was never enacted and faced strong opposition from airline industry groups, who argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider such "extra-statutory requirements" while still enforcing existing consumer protection laws mandated by Congress. This decision is seen as a victory for airlines and a shift in regulatory approach under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Endico Potatoes Inc. has issued a recall for its 2.5 lb bags of frozen peas, carrots, and mixed vegetables due to a possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The affected products were distributed in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, and Washington, D.C. The recall was initiated after routine sampling at a distributor in Pennsylvania tested positive for the bacteria. While no illnesses have been reported, listeria can cause serious infections, and consumers are urged to return the products for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, Giorgio Armani is being remembered not just for his iconic designs but also for his revolutionary business acumen that built a global empire. He famously maintained complete control over his brand, allowing him to execute a consistent and sophisticated vision across a wide range of products. Armani's introduction of the deconstructed power suit for both men and women redefined professional attire and tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. His pioneering use of celebrity endorsements on the red carpet further cemented his brand's status as a symbol of timeless elegance and power.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that an employee was unfairly dismissed for spending less than an hour of work time on personal online browsing. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spy software to track her activity on sites like Amazon. The ruling noted that the time spent was not "excessive," the company had no clear policy against such use, and the business owner herself used a work computer for personal reasons. The judge concluded the dismissal was likely motivated by a desire to remove the employee before she reached two years of service.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, a critical commuter and commercial route through the Sepulveda Pass, will be partially closed on weekends for a major repaving project. The California Department of Transportation announced that the freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction, and motorists are being strongly advised to find alternative routes. The $143.7 million project will cover over 10 miles of the freeway, repaving lanes and upgrading guardrails. This is the beginning of a long-term effort scheduled for completion in late 2028 or early 2029.</p>

          <p>President Trump has increased the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This move partially reverses the $10,000 cap instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had limited a previously unlimited deduction. The change is a significant win for taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who were disproportionately affected by the lower cap. However, critics point to the fiscal impact, with estimates suggesting the change will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable environment for reinvesting their funds. Simply allowing a CD to roll over could lock in a much lower rate. Financial experts suggest exploring alternatives such as high-yield savings accounts or money market accounts, which currently offer competitive, albeit variable, rates with more flexibility. Another strategy is to lock in current rates for an extended period with a new long-term CD, providing security against future rate drops. (not investment advice)</p>

The result comes as Norris aims to close the championship points gap with his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished fourth fastest. Despite setting the pace, Norris noted the competition was "a bit close for my liking," acknowledging that the low-downforce Monza circuit doesn't favor the McLaren car as much as other tracks. The session saw several drivers testing the limits, setting the stage for a competitive weekend.</p>
