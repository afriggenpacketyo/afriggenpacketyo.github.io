          <h2>Women's Sports Bar in Portland Gains Popularity, Promotes Equality</h2>

          <p>The Sports Bra, a pioneering women's sports bar in Portland, Oregon, has garnered a loyal following since opening in 2022. Founder Jenny Nguyen aimed to create a space where women's sports are prominently displayed and celebrated, fostering a sense of belonging for young girls interested in sports. Patrons praise the bar for making women's sports accessible and creating an enthusiastic environment. While viewership of women's sports is growing, inequalities persist, including online abuse and pay disparities. Nguyen hopes the bar's success will drive further investment and equality in women's sports, noting that this is just the beginning of the fight toward equity. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 01:10:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Water voles in Wales are nearing extinction, with a 90% decline in the last 30 years. To combat this, Nature Conservation Cymru is feeding them edible, biodegradable glitter to track their movements through their droppings. The glitter, safe for the voles, comes in different colors to distinguish families and their ranges. By understanding their territory, conservationists can remove invasive species or protect riverbanks to aid dispersal and survival. The team is testing this method on captive-bred voles, offering them glitter-covered apples to monitor consumption and tracking success, with hopes of reintroducing more voles into the wild. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling continued concerns about consumption in the country's economy; the growth was 5.1% year on year, missing estimates. However, industrial output rose by 6.1%, surpassing expectations, indicating that the impact of U.S. tariffs wasn't as severe as anticipated. Fixed-asset investment also saw a rise of 4.0% for the first four months of the year. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1% in April. While exports surged, driven by shipments to Southeast Asian countries, domestic demand and the real estate sector still face challenges. </p>

          <p>Apple is significantly increasing iPhone production in India, aiming for the majority of iPhones sold in the US to originate there. This move is intended to mitigate the impact of trade tensions and tariffs. While India presents opportunities, challenges include cost competitiveness, labor market rigidities, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Making iPhones in India is currently more expensive, requiring investments in infrastructure, skills, and technology. The Indian government is also implementing policies to strengthen the electronics manufacturing ecosystem. </p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in last-minute talks to finalize a significant trade agreement, aiming to reset relations post-Brexit. Discussions focus on defense, trade, fishing rights, and a potential youth mobility scheme. The government is aiming to reduce red tape on food exports and imports to and from the EU. A key aspect involves British access to a substantial EU defense fund, benefiting UK defense companies. Fishing rights and a youth mobility scheme are also under consideration, though the latter has faced opposition due to concerns about free movement. </p>
