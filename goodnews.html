          <p>Uber is introducing a new feature in the U.S. that will allow women drivers and riders to preferentially match with each other, aiming to enhance safety and comfort on the platform. The pilot program, launching next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, lets women create a preference in their app settings. While not a guarantee, the tool increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman pairing. This initiative expands on a similar feature first launched in Saudi Arabia in 2019 and addresses long-standing safety concerns surrounding sexual assault and harassment on ride-hailing apps.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Partially Halts Tennessee Law Restricting Aid to Minors for Out-of-State Abortions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 10:56:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a permanent injunction against a key part of a Tennessee law that criminalized helping minors travel out-of-state for abortions without parental consent. U.S. Circuit Judge Julia Gibbons ruled that the law's "recruitment provision," which banned sharing information about legal abortions, constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment. While this provision is blocked, other parts of the law, such as those criminalizing the physical transport of a minor for an abortion, were upheld. The ruling is seen as a significant victory for free speech and abortion rights advocates in the state.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to allow institutional clients to purchase money market funds as digital tokens on a blockchain. This initiative, which includes major fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, aims to modernize the $7.1 trillion money market industry by enabling faster, 24/7 transactions. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for corporations and hedge funds to manage cash. The move is expected to enhance efficiency by allowing the digital tokens to be used as collateral, streamlining financial operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that a "clean, healthy and sustainable environment" is a fundamental human right. The ruling states that countries have a legal obligation to protect the climate for present and future generations and that failing to do so may violate international law. The case, initiated by Pacific Island nations threatened by rising sea levels, heard testimony from nearly 100 countries. While not legally binding, the opinion carries significant moral authority and is expected to influence future climate negotiations and litigation against high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries during their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. Hayes and Palombo had argued that their actions were common practice and known to their superiors, positioning them as scapegoats for a wider industry issue. Following the ruling, which comes after a decade-long legal battle, calls have emerged for a public inquiry into the prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Barbados have rediscovered the Barbados threadsnake, the world's smallest-known snake, which had not been seen for nearly two decades and was feared to be extinct. The tiny, blind snake, which is thin enough to fit on a coin, was found under a rock in a small forest after a year of searching. Measuring up to just four inches long, the snake burrows in the ground and feeds on termites and ants. The rediscovery is considered significant for conservation efforts on the island, where many endemic species have already been lost to extinction.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has initiated a retrial for Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her attacker's tongue while defending herself from a sexual assault. At 19, Choi was given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lighter one. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now in her 80s, sought to clear her name, a request finally granted by the country's top court. In a significant turn, prosecutors have formally apologized and requested her acquittal, marking a pivotal moment for victims' rights in the nation.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler's decision removes a potential challenger to incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul and keeps him in a highly competitive district that is crucial for maintaining the narrow Republican majority in the U.S. House. His announcement follows speculation about the GOP field, including an apparent endorsement from President Trump for Lawler to remain in Congress, which was seen by some as an effort to clear a path for Rep. Elise Stefanik.</p>

          <p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken by Stanley Forman in 1975, capturing a young woman and a child falling from a collapsed fire escape, led to significant safety reforms in Boston. The image depicted 19-year-old Diana Bryant, who died in the fall, and her 2-year-old goddaughter, who survived by landing on Bryant. The shocking photo was published worldwide and served as a catalyst for change. Within months, Boston amended its city code to mandate that all fire escapes be certified as safe every five years, a regulation that had a ripple effect on fire safety standards across the country.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) announced it had detected and tracked Russian military aircraft flying in international airspace near Alaska. The planes entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), an area outside sovereign U.S. airspace that is closely monitored for national security. NORAD confirmed the aircraft did not enter U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace and were not considered a threat. This event is the latest in a series of similar incidents this year where Russian military planes have been observed operating in the region, prompting responses from U.S. and Canadian forces.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Texas state representative, has emerged as a potential new star for Democrats following a widely discussed appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. A former teacher and aspiring Presbyterian minister, Talarico used the platform to discuss his progressive Christian views, including a reading of the Bible that he argues is ambivalent on abortion. His performance has generated significant buzz and positioned him as a possible contender for a 2026 Senate run. Talarico's rise reflects a growing desire among some Democrats for authentic, unapologetically progressive candidates who can engage with diverse audiences.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China claim to have developed a new aircraft design software that overcomes a major computational hurdle known as the "curse of dimensionality." This innovation allows designers to use a vast number of variables to optimize an aircraft's performance without a corresponding increase in computing load. The team demonstrated their system by creating an improved design based on the U.S. Navy's canceled X-47B stealth drone, simultaneously enhancing its aerodynamics, stealth, and propulsion. This breakthrough could significantly accelerate the development of advanced and complex aircraft by resolving difficult design trade-offs.</p>

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features for its platforms, including enhanced direct messaging protections on Instagram to shield teens from exploitative content and scammers. The company also revealed it removed nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children and an additional 500,000 linked accounts in the first half of 2025. These measures come amid growing pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general who accuse Meta of failing to protect young users from harm. The updates automatically place teen accounts into the strictest settings, limiting contact from unknown adults and filtering offensive messages.</p>

          <p>Scientists in South Korea have developed a discreet, temporary "tattoo" sticker that can quickly detect the presence of drugs commonly used to spike drinks, such as GHB. The sticker contains a chemical indicator that changes color almost instantly when a single drop of a contaminated beverage is applied to it. This innovation aims to provide a faster and more subtle alternative to existing test strips, allowing individuals to check their drinks for safety without drawing attention. A venture company has been established to bring the promising technology to market, though further development is needed to expand its detection capabilities.</p>
