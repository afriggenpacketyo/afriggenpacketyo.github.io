        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article from Fox News posits that the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is advancing the interests of Black Americans by proposing the repeal of Biden-era vehicle tailpipe standards. The author argues these regulations disproportionately harm lower-income communities by increasing the cost of new and used gasoline-powered cars, which are essential for economic mobility. The piece contends that rolling back these standards makes vehicle ownership more affordable, thereby helping to reduce the racial wage gap, and dismisses criticism from environmental justice activists as out of touch.</p>

          <p>Private holding company Ames Watson has acquired approximately 1,000 stores of the bankrupt tween retailer Claire's for $140 million, halting its liquidation process. The new owners diagnose Claire's as a "broken business, not a broken brand" and plan a major overhaul focusing on merchandising, labor, and marketing. The strategy includes updating products to reflect current trends, increasing pay and training for employees, and upgrading the signature ear-piercing stations. By leveraging the brand's nostalgic appeal while modernizing its operations, Ames Watson aims to make the retailer profitable from day one.</p>

          <p>The terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara, has been dismissed due to a procedural error. He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General was not obtained within the six-month statutory time limit. Following the ruling, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to allow religious institutions to build affordable housing on their property by overriding restrictive local zoning laws. This "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) movement aims to address both the national housing shortage and the financial struggles of faith-based organizations with surplus land. The bill would mandate that new housing primarily serves low-income families and would build on similar state-level efforts in places like California. Proponents see it as a way for faith communities to fulfill their missions while creating sustainable income.</p>

          <p>Actor Tim Allen stated that he was moved to forgive the drunk driver who killed his father in 1964 after hearing Erika Kirk's speech at her late husband Charlie Kirk's memorial. At the service, Erika Kirk publicly forgave the man accused of assassinating her husband, stating that the answer to hate is love. Allen, whose father died when he was 11, wrote on social media that her words deeply affected him and allowed him to finally say, "I forgive the man who killed my father" after struggling with it for over 60 years.</p>

          <h2>Health Officials Advise on Differentiating Flu and COVID-19 Symptoms Amid Rising Cases</h2>

          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are warning of a seasonal rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, creating confusion due to their overlapping symptoms. While the flu often presents suddenly with fever and body aches, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved, now commonly including cold-like signs such as a runny nose and sore throat, with a hoarse voice being a hallmark of recent variants. Both viruses can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations. Authorities are urging eligible individuals, including those over 65 and people with underlying health conditions, to get vaccinated against both viruses to reduce hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>A submersible exploring an uncharted munitions dump site in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered vibrant marine ecosystems flourishing on unexploded Nazi-era bombs. Scientists were surprised to find dense populations of animals, including starfish, crabs, and marine worms, covering the surface of V-1 cruise missiles resting on the seafloor. While the explosive chemicals are highly toxic, the munitions' hard casings provide a crucial habitat in an area where natural rock structures were previously removed. This remarkable discovery highlights nature's ability to adapt and utilize human-made structures, even those designed for destruction, for survival.</p>

          <p>A coordinated sting operation by Interpol across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running romance scams and "sextortion" schemes. The operation, funded by the UK, targeted criminal networks that exploit victims online for financial gain, with estimated losses totaling nearly $2.8 million from over 1,400 identified victims. Authorities seized numerous devices and dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups. The crackdown highlights the sharp rise in digital-enabled crimes in Africa and the international effort to disrupt networks that prey on vulnerable individuals through social media and dating platforms.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Banning Masks for Federal Officers Could Restore Public Trust</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that to protect both law enforcement officers and democracy, the use of masks by federal agents should be banned. The author contends that while politically motivated violence is unacceptable, the sight of anonymous, masked federal officers on American streets erodes public trust and raises tensions more than political rhetoric. Citing California's new law attempting to ban such masks, the piece suggests that accountability and transparency are crucial for de-escalation. Instead of allowing officers to hide their identities, leaders should foster an environment where they feel safe enough to perform their duties without masks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion of a link between Tylenol and autism, medical experts are emphasizing a more nuanced view of the research. Physicians and even authors of studies cited by the White House clarify that while some association exists with chronic use, no causal relationship has been proven, and acetaminophen remains the safest option for treating fever in pregnancy. Untreated fevers pose significant, documented risks to a fetus, including birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. The consensus from medical groups is that pregnant individuals should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time under a doctor's guidance.</p>

          <p>A travel article explores the psychological appeal of returning to the same vacation spot, describing it as a traveler's version of comfort food. While some seek new challenges, many find joy in the familiarity and deepening connection that repeat visits offer. Southern California readers shared their cherished destinations, including London, for its enduring magic; Mexico's La Costalegre, for its relaxing local vibe; and Maui's Napili Kai Beach Resort, for its family-oriented, traditional Hawaiian experience. Psychologists note that because both people and places change over time, revisiting a location can create new, meaningful memories with each trip.</p>

          <p>Lydia Hearst, a great-granddaughter of media magnate William Randolph Hearst, and her husband, actor Chris Hardwick, have listed their historic Los Feliz mansion for $21.5 million. Known as the Victor Rossetti Residence, the Spanish Colonial-style home was designed in the 1920s by famed architect Paul R. Williams. Spanning nearly 9,000 square feet on a one-acre lot, the property features 10 bedrooms, ornate details like coffered ceilings and stained-glass windows, and a hidden bookshelf door. If it sells near its asking price, it would be one of the most expensive home sales in the neighborhood's history.</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, retired Admiral Bill McRaven reflects on whether the United States is still perceived as a global force for good. He argues that America's historical greatness is tied to its goodness, citing actions like the Marshall Plan, but acknowledges that recent transactional foreign policies have caused allies to question this role. McRaven also discusses the military's apolitical nature, emphasizing that its oath is to the Constitution, not a president. He expresses concern over the current political climate but maintains optimism that the American people will ultimately reject authoritarian trends and hold their leaders accountable.</p>
