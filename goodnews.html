          <p>Derrick Groves, the final inmate from a May New Orleans jailbreak, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief stand-off, concluding a massive multi-agency manhunt for the 10 escapees. Groves, 28, was convicted last year of two counts of second-degree murder and faces a life sentence, now also facing charges for his escape. Authorities located him in a crawl space after deploying gas. Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams emphasized that Groves' capture brings long-awaited calm to victims and the community, with investigations into any assistance he received ongoing. </p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, has been arrested in Florida, accused of "maliciously" igniting a New Year's Day brush fire in Pacific Palisades that ultimately rekindled into the devastating Palisades Fire. This blaze became one of Los Angeles's most destructive wildfires, burning over 23,000 acres, destroying nearly 7,000 structures, and tragically killing 12 people. Investigators utilized Rinderknecht's phone data, including a screen recording of him attempting 911 calls and asking ChatGPT about culpability for fires, along with a ChatGPT-generated image depicting a burning city, to link him to the incident. He faces charges of destruction of property by fire, with potential for further, more severe charges. </p>

          <p>AMD stock surged 11% on Wednesday, extending a significant rally after OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions in AI equipment from the chipmaker. The deal, which could give OpenAI up to 10% ownership in AMD based on stock price and partnership milestones, has boosted investor confidence in AMD's ability to compete with Nvidia in the AI chip market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at the agreement, calling it "imaginative" but questioning the timing. This marks AMD's best weekly gain since April 2016, highlighting its growing presence in the AI sector. </p>

DNA evidence, matched through a joint effort by forensic agencies and the Criminal Investigation Resource Center, linked Nowakowski to the crime over six decades later. Nowakowski, who had a lengthy criminal record including an attack on an elderly woman in 1973, was not a suspect at the time of the original investigation. Blackburn's niece, now 81, expressed profound gratitude for the long-awaited resolution. </p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch delivered a confident and relaxed speech at the party's annual conference, aiming to re-energize the Tories amidst low poll ratings and widespread skepticism. Her address, arguably her best as leader, included a surprise plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases, seeking to establish the Conservatives as wise custodians of public finances and differentiate them from Labour. Badenoch outlined various new policies, from scrapping business rates to boosting apprenticeships, in an effort to regain public attention and rebuild the party's credibility. The impact of these announcements on voter sentiment remains to be seen. </p>

Despite working multiple jobs due to California's high cost of living, they actively pursue their musical dreams.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is significantly more affordable than a credit card this October, presenting a clear preference for homeowners needing sizable funds. The average HELOC rate stands at 7.89%, starkly contrasting with the 22.25% average for credit cards, making credit cards 182% more expensive. This cost difference is crucial given the recent rise in interest rates due to inflation. Furthermore, HELOCs offer potential tax deductions if used for qualifying home repair projects, a benefit not available with credit cards. While both have variable rates, only HELOCs are expected to become materially more affordable with future Fed rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England captain Harry Kane will miss Thursday's friendly against Wales due to a minor ankle injury sustained during a recent Bayern Munich match, taking a kick to his ankle. While he is expected to be fit for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia next Tuesday, manager Thomas Tuchel deemed it too painful and risky for him to play. This injury highlights England's reliance on Kane, their record goalscorer, who accounts for a significant portion of the team's goals since 2015. Ollie Watkins and Marcus Rashford are potential replacements for the upcoming match. </p>

The FOMC voted 11-1 for the initial cut, bringing the federal funds rate to 4%-4.25%. Tariffs were discussed, with a general feeling they wouldn't cause lasting inflation.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, announced a key policy pledge to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland, aiming to boost homeownership and unlock a more aspirational society. This surprise announcement, delivered at her first conference speech, is part of a broader strategy to grab political attention and differentiate the Tories from Labour. The party estimates the cut would cost the Treasury £9bn annually after 2029, to be funded by £47bn in planned welfare, foreign aid, and Civil Service savings. The proposal was well-received by party activists. </p>

A tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of Baja California Sur, including Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. Forecasters predict further weakening over the next 48 hours as Priscilla moves parallel to the coast, remaining offshore. However, large swells generated by the storm are expected to cause life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding along parts of the coast. </p>
