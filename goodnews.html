          <p>The Philippines and Japan held a joint maritime exercise in the South China Sea, focusing on strengthening international cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.  The exercise involved a Philippine Navy frigate and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer, conducting drills such as anti-submarine warfare. This follows repeated incursions by Chinese vessels into Philippine waters and China's rejection of a 2016 arbitration ruling.  The agreement to facilitate joint exercises was signed last July, and the countries also participate in multilateral exercises with the US and Australia.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the Schengen Agreement's 40th anniversary celebration with President Trump's military parade.  Schengen, symbolizing borderless travel in Europe, represents a different vision of international order than Trump's display of military might.  The author notes the irony of Schengen's initial focus on excluding unwanted outsiders while highlighting the enduring popularity of free movement within the EU.  The contrast underscores the diverging visions of international cooperation and security.</p>
