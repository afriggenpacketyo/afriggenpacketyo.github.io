The computer manufacturer now anticipates annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, a significant jump from its previous forecast of 3% to 4%. CEO Michael Dell stated that the company is successfully converting high customer demand for AI-related compute, storage, and networking solutions into substantial growth and cash flow, positioning itself as a leader in the AI infrastructure market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees looking to buy a new home can use a specialized financial product called a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for Purchase. This option allows individuals aged 62 and older to combine a significant down payment, typically 45% to 62% of the home's price, with funds from a reverse mortgage to complete the purchase. The primary advantage is that it eliminates the need for monthly mortgage payments, freeing up fixed retirement income for other living expenses. However, borrowers must still cover property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance costs to keep the loan in good standing.</p>

          <p>Thirty paintings by beloved television artist Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to raise funds for small and rural public television stations facing financial strain due to federal funding cuts. The collection, valued between $850,000 and $1.4 million, includes works created on-air during his popular show, "The Joy of Painting." All proceeds will help stations affiliated with American Public Television cover licensing fees for popular programming. This initiative aims to preserve Ross's legacy of making art accessible while supporting the medium that brought his work into millions of homes.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the S&P 500's performance following the last ten U.S. government shutdowns reveals that markets have historically shown resilience and often post gains. For example, the index rose 36% in the year after the 2019 shutdown, suggesting investors tend to look past the immediate political turmoil. Financial experts advise that the market typically prices in future conditions rather than short-term political "noise," recommending that investors remain patient and maintain broad, diversified portfolios rather than reacting to headlines.

          <p>British number one tennis player Jack Draper has appointed Jamie Delgado, the former coach of Andy Murray, as his new head coach. Delgado is renowned for his successful partnership with Murray, during which the Scot achieved the world number one ranking and won his second Wimbledon title in 2016. Draper, who has been sidelined by an arm injury since Wimbledon, is aiming to build on his recent successes, which include winning his first Masters 1000 title. The move signals a strategic shift for Draper as he prepares for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A youth-led movement in Morocco, known as Gen Z 212, has organized some of the country's largest recent anti-government protests, demanding political and social reforms. Operating anonymously, the group coordinates its actions primarily through the online platform Discord, which was originally popular with gamers. Organizers use the platform to hold democratic votes on protest strategies, disseminate information, and maintain security against infiltration by authorities. The movement, sparked by anger over conditions at a public hospital, reflects a new, digitally native form of decentralized activism that prioritizes collective decision-making and anonymity.</p>

          <h2>Cardiologists Recommend a Fiber-Rich Afternoon Snack to Help Lower Cholesterol</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 13:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, adopting the habit of eating a fiber-rich snack in the afternoon is a key strategy for lowering cholesterol. Soluble fiber, in particular, helps by binding to cholesterol in the digestive system and preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. In addition to directly lowering LDL ("bad") cholesterol, high-fiber foods promote a feeling of fullness, which can aid in weight management and support healthy blood sugar levels. Experts suggest snacks like an apple with nuts, roasted chickpeas, or yogurt with raspberries to help meet daily fiber goals and improve cardiovascular health.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team narrowly defeated Bangladesh by four wickets in their Women's World Cup opener, thanks to a resilient, unbeaten 79 from captain Heather Knight. Chasing a modest target of 179, England's batting lineup faltered against spin, collapsing to 103-6 and raising fears of a major upset. However, Knight, aided by a crucial partnership with Charlie Dean, guided the team to victory in the 47th over.
