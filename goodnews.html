          <p>Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) closed up 15% after reports indicated the video game company is nearing a substantial $50 billion deal to go private. Investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Silver Lake, are reportedly involved, with an announcement potentially coming as early as next week. This proposed leveraged buyout, which would be the largest in Wall Street history, underscores PIF's aggressive expansion into the gaming sector, acquiring stakes in major developers. EA, known for popular titles like The Sims and Madden NFL, has seen its stock rise significantly this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With national credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates over 21%, many borrowers face overwhelming financial pressure. This article outlines how credit card debt forgiveness, or settlement, could reduce a $20,000 balance by 30% to 50%, translating to savings of $6,000 to $10,000. The process involves negotiating with creditors for a lump-sum payment, often resolving debt within three to five years, a much faster alternative to decades of minimum payments. While offering substantial relief, debt settlement can negatively impact credit scores and may incur tax liabilities on the forgiven amount. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, home equity loans present an increasingly attractive and affordable option for borrowing $20,000, particularly for homeowners with existing equity. Monthly payments for a $20,000 loan currently range from approximately $194 to $246 over 10 or 15 years, with fixed rates providing budgeting stability. Despite a modest impact from the latest rate reductions, these loans offer significant advantages over personal loans or credit cards, including potential tax deductibility for home repairs. Borrowers are advised to meticulously calculate costs, given that their home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare orange lobster, affectionately named Jean-Clawed Van Damme, has been successfully released into the Long Island Sound after a shopper discovered it alive in a New York grocery store tank. These vibrant crustaceans are estimated to be a one-in-30-million find, making its survival and rescue particularly remarkable. The observant shopper purchased the lobster with the intention of freeing it, improvising initial care before a wildlife rescue group and the New York Aquarium facilitated its return to the wild. This heartwarming story unfolded just before National Lobster Day, offering a stark contrast to the fate of countless other lobsters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted as Labour MPs, ending a year-long suspension for voting against the government's two-child benefit cap. They were among seven left-wing MPs who rebelled shortly after Labour's 2024 landslide, advocating for the cap's abolition. Labour has recently softened its stance on the policy, which restricts benefits for third or subsequent children, with deputy leadership candidates now expressing opposition. The Resolution Foundation estimates scrapping the cap would cost £3.5bn and lift 470,000 children out of poverty, making it a key issue for Labour's upcoming conference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October remains a strategic move for savers. This article highlights three key advantages: immediate interest compounding, the high probability of another Fed rate cut by month-end (estimated at 85.5%), and the likelihood that banks may reduce their rates even before the official Fed announcement. Proactive savers can still lock in attractive rates, potentially around 4.50%, especially through online banks, ensuring reliable and predictable interest earnings before potential further declines in the market.

Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism about stabilizing production rates and potentially increasing them in the future, marking a significant step towards restoring the company's regulatory standing.</p>
