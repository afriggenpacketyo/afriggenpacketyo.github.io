          <p>Beyonc√©'s Cowboy Carter tour kicked off its London residency at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, showcasing her new country era with a visually stunning, three-hour performance. The show featured elaborate costumes, a gold mechanical bull, and homages to black performers who were historically excluded from the country music scene. Ticket sales were reportedly slow, with some fans feeling short-changed due to dynamic pricing strategies that saw prices slashed before the show. Despite the spectacle, some critics noted that the stadium setting might not be the best venue for a country-themed performance, while others suggested the setlist could have included more of her classic hits. The singer's performance was nonetheless a resounding success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government in England will require developers to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes, according to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. The regulations will be published later this year as part of the Future Homes Standard, with a transitional period for developers to adjust. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against "burdensome" paperwork that could hinder the construction of 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Miliband stated that the move is "just common sense" and will save households ¬£500 a year on energy bills, with exemptions only for buildings covered by shade. This policy aims to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in new housing.</p>

          <p>Broadcom reported strong quarterly results and offered positive commentary on its artificial intelligence business, leading to an increased price target from an analyst. The company's fiscal Q2 revenue increased by 20% year-over-year to $15 billion, exceeding expectations, and adjusted earnings per share also surpassed estimates. CEO Hock Tan anticipates continued robust growth in AI revenue into fiscal year 2026, driven by demand for custom AI chips and networking solutions. Despite a slight dip in after-hours trading, the analyst maintains a hold-equivalent rating but raises the price target to $290 per share, citing Broadcom's strong performance and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws protect all employees equally, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. The justices rejected the view that "majority group" members must show more evidence of discrimination to win lawsuits. The ruling revives a lawsuit by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against "any individual" based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex.
