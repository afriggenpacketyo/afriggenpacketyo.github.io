          <p>Los Angeles Rams receiver Davante Adams has voiced concerns about Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter playing significant snaps on both offense and defense. While acknowledging Hunter's athletic talent, Adams predicted that the demanding workload would double his risk of injury and potentially shorten his NFL career. He specifically questioned how Hunter's frame would hold up when tackling larger players in the league. The Jaguars have listed Hunter, a former two-way college star, as a starting wide receiver and backup cornerback on their initial depth chart, signaling their intent to utilize his versatility.</p>

          <p>Economists in China are currently debating the merits of establishing official consumption benchmarks, similar to the country's GDP growth targets, for the next five-year plan. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a goal for the household consumption rate—which stood at a low 39.6% in 2023—is a crucial national strategy to bolster domestic demand. However, other influential thinkers express skepticism, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as effective policy goals. The discussion reflects ongoing efforts within Beijing to rebalance the economy by encouraging more consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that the states demonstrated a likelihood of "irreparable harm" if the funds were repurposed, as it would halt hundreds of approved projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters. The court will continue to review the legality of the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A major copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by a state-owned Chinese company, is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year after a 17-year delay. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to the China Metallurgical Group Corporation in 2008 but was stalled by security issues, archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government announced last year that the project would switch to underground mining to better protect ancient Buddhist relics at the site, signaling a renewed push to develop the nation's mineral wealth.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decline in property crime. Notably, murders fell by 14.9% and motor vehicle thefts saw a historic 18.6% one-year drop, though some experts note aggravated assaults remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. The report also documented a slight decrease in overall hate crime incidents.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ordinance, aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to allow time for compliance. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over air conditioning. The law reflects a growing public health concern as deadly heat waves become more frequent and intense in the region.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is set to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as other quarterbacks on the roster, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, are dealing with hamstring injuries, and veteran Joe Flacco is not expected to play much in the preseason. Sanders, who was drafted in the fifth round after a prolific college career under his father, Deion Sanders, was surprisingly listed as fourth on the depth chart just a day earlier. This start provides him a significant opportunity to compete for a roster spot.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates, Chemours and Corteva, to resolve claims related to pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. State officials called it the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund the cleanup of four industrial sites across New Jersey. It also establishes a substantial reserve fund to protect taxpayers if the companies fail to meet their obligations. The settlement addresses decades of pollution from the toxic, persistent chemicals.</p>

          <p>New research based on 20 years of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park indicates that social bonds between female mountain gorillas are more crucial than previously thought. The study found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she actively seeks out and joins other females she already knows, even if they have been apart for many years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex relationships in gorilla society, as having an ally can provide significant social benefits and help a newcomer navigate the group's hierarchy. The findings shed light on the evolutionary roots of social movement.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements that have made weather forecasting more accurate than ever, public perception of its reliability can still be low. This article explores the complexities behind forecasting, from the inherent unpredictability of chaotic atmospheric systems to the challenges of communicating vast amounts of data in a simple format. While a one-day forecast is now over 90% correct, tiny errors can still lead to different outcomes. The piece also discusses the future of meteorology, including the potential of AI to create more detailed, localized, and long-range predictions, which may further change how weather information is presented.</p>
