          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment icon, has announced his decision to retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway after six decades, citing the irreversible effects of aging. Buffett noted experiencing balance issues, memory lapses, and declining vision. He will remain chairman, while Greg Abel will assume the role of CEO on January 1, 2026. Buffett emphasized his continued mental sharpness for investment decisions, particularly during market downturns, and said he will be useful if there's a panic in the market because he doesn't get fearful when things go down in price or everybody else gets scared.</p>

The technology dates back to the late 19th century, with German physicist Christian H√ºlsmeyer creating the Telemobiloskop in 1904.

This research offers the strongest evidence yet supporting the theory that volcanism billions of years ago resulted in the accumulation of radioactive elements deep inside the near side's mantle.
