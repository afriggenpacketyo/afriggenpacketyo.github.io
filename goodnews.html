          <p>Investors are showing a strong preference for short-term Treasury investments, mirroring a strategy also adopted by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) have attracted significant inflows, indicating a focus on stability and less volatility in the shorter end of the fixed-income market. Experts suggest that long-duration investments are currently less appealing due to market uncertainty, while short-term T-Bills offer attractive annualized yields. Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>
