          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is preparing for a significant speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, where he is expected to address the U.S. economic outlook. The address comes as the central bank faces intense pressure from the White House to lower interest rates, creating a politically charged environment. Investors will be closely watching for any hints about a potential rate cut in September, although Powell may maintain ambiguity given conflicting economic signals like persistent inflation and a weakening labor market. The speech will also cover the Fed's long-term policy framework and the critical importance of its political independence.</p>

          <p>The brain-computer interface company Synchron has developed a new implant that enables individuals with severe paralysis to control Apple devices, including iPads and iPhones, using only their thoughts. This marks the first time a BCI has connected wirelessly to Apple products through the official protocol, eliminating the need for custom software. The system uses artificial intelligence to translate the user's brain signals into digital commands, allowing them to send messages, browse apps, and control smart home technology. This technological advancement represents a significant step forward in assistive technology, offering greater independence and autonomy to people with disabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the approximately $527 million financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump and his co-defendants in his civil fraud case, ruling the fine was "excessive" and barred by the Eighth Amendment. While the massive disgorgement was vacated, the court upheld other sanctions, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation. The panel of justices was deeply divided on the case's merits, leading to a complex series of opinions that settled on removing the financial penalty. New York's Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision to the state's highest court.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 13:20:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The lengthy and expensive process of building new pharmaceutical plants, exemplified by Fujifilm's new $3 billion facility in North Carolina, illustrates the difficulty drugmakers face in quickly moving production to the U.S. even with potential tariffs from the Trump administration. It can take three to five years to get a complex biologics manufacturing site operational, a timeline that makes it hard to react swiftly to trade policy changes. While companies like Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron are increasing their U.S. manufacturing footprint, partly due to tax incentives, the industry is still heavily reliant on overseas production, especially from Europe. This highlights the complex supply chain realities that limit how quickly domestic production can be scaled up.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have detailed their new trade framework, under which the U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and other goods. In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and provide preferential market access for certain U.S. agricultural and seafood products. The agreement also includes commitments for the EU to purchase at least $40 billion in U.S. AI chips and substantially increase its procurement of American military equipment. This pact aims to rebalance the trade relationship and prevent the higher tariffs previously threatened by President Trump, putting one of the world's largest economic partnerships on more solid footing.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Nearly Half of American Adults Order from Kids' Menus</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that approximately 44% of adults in the U.S. are now ordering meals from kids' menus at restaurants, driven by a desire to save money and consume smaller portions. This trend coincides with rising fast-food prices and broader economic pressures that are causing some consumers to cut back on dining out. Diners report that the lower prices and simpler options on children's menus are appealing alternatives to more expensive adult meals. The shift highlights how consumers are adapting their spending habits in response to inflation and the significantly increased cost of eating at restaurants over the past decade.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has launched an autonomous drone delivery service called "Zipotle" in the Dallas area through a partnership with logistics provider Zipline. The service allows customers to receive their digital orders via small aircraft, called Zips, which can deliver food within minutes. To use the service, customers place orders through the Zipline app; a drone then picks up the packaged meal and delivers it by hovering and gently lowering the order to the ground. Initially available from one location to a small number of customers, Chipotle plans to expand the service, aiming to deliver fresh food quickly to hard-to-reach places like backyards and parks.</p>

          <h2>Market Rotation Eases as Meta Pauses AI Hiring Spree</h2>

          <p>The stock market's recent sharp rotation away from high-valuation stocks appears to be slowing after two days of intense activity. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has reportedly paused its aggressive hiring of artificial intelligence researchers and engineers after bringing on more than 50 new specialists. A company spokesperson characterized the move as routine organizational planning rather than a slowdown in its overall AI investment. In broader market news, Walmart's stock fell after missing earnings-per-share estimates, and investors are now looking ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upcoming speech for further market direction.
