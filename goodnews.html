          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared her decision to raise her two children as a single parent, a choice relationship experts are praising as a sign of strength and self-awareness. Theron explained that she recognized her tendency to lose herself in relationships and wanted to avoid repeating the tumultuous family dynamics she witnessed growing up. Experts note that her decision reflects an alignment with her personal capabilities and a move away from historical dependencies on partnership. They emphasize that choosing to be single can be a powerful and healthy choice, rather than a sign of weakness.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: The Rise of 'Tipflation' and Confusion Over Modern Tipping Culture</h2>

          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in situations where it was not previously expected, such as at fast-food counters or self-service kiosks. This article explores how technology, which often defaults to pre-calculated tip options of 15-25%, creates social pressure and confusion for consumers. Experts note that while these prompts increase tip amounts, they can also irritate customers and decrease the likelihood of repeat business. The shift from cash to card, accelerated by the pandemic, embedded these tip requests into payment software, fundamentally changing tipping norms.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a ceasefire in its war with Israel, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations on the implementation mechanism. The proposal reportedly involves a two-month truce, which President Trump announced Israel had previously agreed to. While optimistic, Trump acknowledged the situation remains volatile. A Palestinian official indicated that Hamas is still seeking firm guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and a permanent end to the war as part of any final agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the non-alcoholic drink can lower the body's primary stress hormone. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no credible studies to support these claims. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone, and doctors rarely advise patients to lower it outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink's ingredients like coconut water, juice, and magnesium are generally harmless and can aid hydration, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on cortisol levels or overall stress.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been discovered in a New York basement, exciting scholars. The machine is considered a crucial artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as its innovative design for handling complex characters laid the groundwork for today's input methods. The typewriter ingeniously breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, allowing access to tens of thousands of characters. Now acquired by Stanford University, the discovery highlights a pivotal moment in preserving the Chinese language in the technological age.</p>

Despite public fascination with sharks, the researchers note that securing financial support for their vital conservation and research work remains a significant challenge due to the animals' fearsome reputation.</p>

          <p>An Arizona couple was fined $4,000 by their property management company for posting negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included issues like black mold. A clause in their lease prohibited negative reviews and imposed a $2,000 penalty per post, but such "gag clauses" are illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). The act protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without fear of retaliation. After being contacted by local news, the real estate company stated it would remove the clause from future contracts, bringing attention to this unlawful business practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule posits that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering anger is a result of consciously or unconsciously rerunning the negative thought, giving individuals a window to choose a different reaction. Gawdat suggests that by acknowledging this brief chemical process, people can gain control and more quickly recover from life's daily upsets.</p>

The experience helped her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by connecting with new communities, and change her definition of self-care from passive appointments to active, creative pursuits. She argues that contrary to popular belief, one should not wait for work-life balance to find a hobby; rather, getting a hobby is the secret to creating that balance by forcing one to define personal boundaries.</p>
