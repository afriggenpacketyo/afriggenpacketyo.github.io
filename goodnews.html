          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Cairo, meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi to deepen their bilateral relationship. The two nations agreed to enhance collaboration on China's Belt and Road Initiative, focusing on trade, manufacturing, renewable energy, and technology. This visit underscores China's strategy to increase its influence in the Middle East, with significant Chinese investment already funding major infrastructure projects in Egypt, including Africa's tallest skyscraper and modernizations to the country's electrical grid. The discussions aim to build on a long history of trade and cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved significant upgrades to its disaster response plans following an unusual swarm of over 1,700 tremors in the Tokara Islands. While officials state this activity is not a precursor to the feared Nankai Trough earthquake, they acknowledge a major disaster is inevitable. The updated plan aims to reduce the projected death toll from a potential magnitude-9 quake by 80% over the next decade. Measures include building taller sea walls, constructing tsunami refuge towers, and emphasizing public education on rapid evacuation, as some coastal areas could be hit by waves within five minutes of a quake.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 05:35:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in several counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling, from Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, responds to a lawsuit by advocacy groups alleging unconstitutional practices like racial profiling and warrantless arrests by federal agents. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, stating its agents target serious criminals. The order specifically bars arrests based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at locations like day laborer sites, pending a future hearing.</p>

          <p>Ahead of his return to the ring against Randy Orton, WWE superstar Drew McIntyre shared his "honest" perspective on the current landscape of the promotion. McIntyre suggested that Orton may have lost his "killer instinct" after a recent loss to Cody Rhodes, and he characterized the current version of John Cena in unflattering terms. He expressed a desire to face Rhodes for the championship, seeing their careers as parallel journeys that have reached different destinations. McIntyre positions himself as a truth-teller, even if it casts him as the "bad guy" in the eyes of some fans.</p>

          <p>In response to increasing flood events across the United States, this article offers a guide for homeowners and renters to assess their property's flood risk. It highlights that as the climate changes, over 14 million homes face substantial flood risk, many of which are outside official flood zones. The guide advises asking key questions, such as a property's flood history and its official FEMA flood zone designation. It also provides resources for finding this information, like real estate websites and state emergency management agencies, noting that disclosure laws for sellers and landlords vary significantly by state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As France's far-right National Rally party gains popularity, it is maintaining a wary and distant relationship with President Donald Trump's administration, unlike other European populist movements. Analysts suggest this caution stems from several factors, including a traditional French skepticism of U.S. influence, the potential negative impact of American tariffs on the party's blue-collar base, and widespread French antipathy towards Trump. While ideologically aligned on many issues, party leader Marine Le Pen and her protégé Jordan Bardella are pursuing a strategy of "vote maximalization" by appearing more moderate to attract mainstream voters ahead of the 2027 presidential election.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, home of the L.A. Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand to create an indoor beach. The move was an effort to reimagine the sport and attract new fans by presenting it in a modern, arena-style environment with premium amenities. Players expressed that competing under the halo scoreboard in a major professional venue made them feel like true professional athletes in a way that traditional beach settings sometimes do not. The controlled indoor environment also changed the game's dynamics, eliminating wind and allowing for more powerful, consistent play.</p>
