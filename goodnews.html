        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 12,000-year-old archaeological site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is capturing public imagination, but also attracting conspiracy theories popularized by figures like Graham Hancock and podcaster Joe Rogan. These theories suggest a "lost civilization" built the site and accuse archaeologists of hiding discoveries, fueling public suspicion. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow excavation process is necessary to protect the site for future research, not to conceal information. The true purpose of the ancient ceremonial hub remains a mystery, representing one of humanity's earliest examples of complex storytelling.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops taking down propaganda loudspeakers along the shared border, signaling a reciprocal de-escalation measure. This action follows South Korea's decision in June, under President Lee Jae Myung's new administration, to halt its own anti-Pyongyang broadcasts. The move marks a shift from the hard-line policies of the previous government and is part of President Lee's broader effort to reopen dialogue with the North. These cross-border propaganda campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened tension between the two technically-at-war nations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially signed striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million, including add-ons. The 22-year-old Slovenia international has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major attacking acquisition this summer. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, expressed his excitement about the club's future and his eagerness to develop under manager Ruben Amorim. Known for his pace and physical presence, Sesko was the top goalscorer under 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of the Strait of Messina Bridge project, a massive undertaking to connect Sicily with the mainland that has been debated for decades. Set to be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, the project is estimated to cost €13.5 billion and is slated for completion by 2032. Despite concerns about seismic activity in the region, engineers believe the risks can be managed with modern technology, citing successful bridges in Japan and Turkey. The project faces local opposition from groups who argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure, but proponents highlight its potential for economic prosperity and job creation.</p>

          <p>Etiquette expert Elaine Swann provides advice on how to be a considerate houseguest, emphasizing that respect for the host's space is paramount, no matter how close the relationship. Key tips include giving ample notice, being prepared for a "no," and keeping visits to a manageable length, such as four days. Guests should communicate their plans, be self-sufficient with transportation, and avoid overstaying their welcome. While a host might say "make yourself at home," guests should still be mindful, tidy up after themselves, and show appreciation with a thoughtful gift or gesture.</p>

          <p>European destinations are experiencing a significant increase in Chinese tourists this summer, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as a recent report found 72% of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is notably higher than for other key markets like the U.S. and Japan. Marketing professionals in tourism hubs like Brussels are optimistic, noting the widespread presence of Chinese visitors and the sound of Mandarin in city centers.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth after an onboard explosion, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell became a hero for his calm leadership in 1970, turning a near-catastrophe into what NASA called one of its finest hours. He was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, the first mission to orbit the Moon, making him the first person to travel to the Moon twice without ever landing on it. His life and the Apollo 13 story were famously immortalized in the 1995 film starring Tom Hanks.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to forge a career in the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby union.

          <p>The England women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are framing their upcoming World Cup campaign as an "Everest" expedition, a metaphor inspired by a talk from mountaineer Jo Bradshaw.

The team is managing expectations and using challenging matches as preparation for the tournament's tougher stages. Dow, who has recovered from a recent injury, stated her entire focus is on the World Cup cycle, putting club contract negotiations on hold until after the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: U.S. Tariff Threats May Push India Closer to EU Amid Sanctions on Russian Oil Refining</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 00:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU has sanctioned an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil, but experts believe this will have less impact on EU-India trade relations than the threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. This pressure from the U.S. may paradoxically strengthen India's desire to finalize a free trade agreement with the EU, seeking more predictable economic partners. The EU has taken a more measured approach in trade negotiations, particularly regarding India's sensitive agricultural sector. This dynamic could benefit the EU-India relationship and potentially align with Western interests if it leads India to reduce its reliance on Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>
