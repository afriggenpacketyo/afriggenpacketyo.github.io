          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third year in a row. The report considers tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and the availability of allergists. The article provides tips from Dr. Purvi Parikh on managing allergy symptoms, including starting medications early, washing clothes after spending time outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing. Parikh also advises seeking medical care if breathing issues arise, as they could indicate asthma. The article notes that allergy symptoms can be similar to those of colds and viruses.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports have experienced a significant surge. The UK has become China's second-largest export destination for EVs and fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles. The article attributes this trend to the UK's standard 10% import tariff, which is the same as other non-EU rivals, making Chinese EVs more attractive due to affordability. In March alone, China's hybrid EV exports to the UK increased dramatically, indicating a growing preference for plug-in hybrids among British consumers.</p>

          <h2>A Psychiatrist Argues That Mothers Should Cut Themselves Some Slack</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and cut themselves some slack. She argues that being flawed is an important part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross also notes that the field of psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, overlooking the credit they deserve. She includes a quiz to help mothers recognize that they are good enough, even if they are not perfect.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year US mortgage rate remained steady at 6.76%, near its highest levels for the year, but below the 7.09% average from a year prior. Rates for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for US Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season.</p>
