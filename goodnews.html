          <p>A United Airlines flight traveling from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Salt Lake City last week after pilots detected a crack in one of the aircraft's multilayer windshield panels. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has initiated an investigation, dispatching the Boeing 737's windscreen to its laboratory for thorough analysis. Despite the damage, the windshield's design allowed for a safe landing, with all 134 passengers and six crew members continuing their journey on a replacement aircraft. The NTSB's inquiry will involve interviewing the flight crew and reviewing voice and data recorder information to ascertain the cause, specifically whether an object struck the windshield mid-flight. This incident highlights the robust safety features of modern aircraft.</p>

          <p>Atlanta United announced the firing of head coach Ronny Deila after a single, disappointing season where the team managed a 5-13-16 record, finishing 14th in the Eastern Conference. Despite Deila's previous MLS Cup success with New York City FC and substantial investments in players like Emmanuel Latte Lath and Miguel Almirón, the club's performance, including only one win in its last 18 matches, fell short of expectations. CEO Garth Lagerwey stated that the decision was made to move the team in a different direction, initiating an immediate global search for a new coach. This move underscores the club's commitment to improving its on-field product for its dedicated fanbase.</p>

This directive from the Foreign Office underscores a commitment to authenticity and honesty in the selection process for the high-profile, £155,000-£174,000 role. The warning comes amid research indicating that a significant portion of jobseekers, particularly younger workers, are employing AI for applications. The successful candidate is expected to possess exceptional networking abilities, strong personal impact, and astute political judgment. This stance highlights evolving concerns about AI's role in professional recruitment and the integrity of application processes.</p>

          <h2>Kevin Muscat's Deal to Manage Rangers Falls Through</h2>

          <p>Kevin Muscat's expected appointment as the new head coach for Rangers has fallen through, primarily due to his ongoing commitments with Chinese club Shanghai Port. Shanghai Port remains in contention for the Super League title, meaning Muscat's availability could be delayed until late in the year, which was deemed unfeasible for both parties. This development comes after former Rangers boss Steven Gerrard declined a return and Danny Rohl withdrew from consideration. Rangers, currently struggling in sixth place in the Scottish Premiership and having failed to qualify for the Champions League, are actively interviewing multiple candidates and anticipate making an announcement within the coming days to stabilize the team's performance.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Matthew Stafford spearheaded the Los Angeles Rams to a dominant 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars at a rainy Wembley Stadium, throwing five touchdown passes. Davante Adams was a key recipient, catching three scores, while rookies Konata Mumpfield and Terrance Ferguson also contributed touchdowns. This win marks the Rams' impressive 5-2 start, their best since their Super Bowl-winning 2021 season, even without injured star receiver Puka Nacua. The Rams' defense was formidable, recording seven sacks, while the Jaguars' offense struggled, with rookie Travis Hunter's first NFL touchdown being their only notable moment.

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, as both host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live," adeptly used her platform to respond to public scrutiny of her suggestive artistic persona. A standout QVC sketch featured Carpenter as a designer seemingly unaware of the phallic shape of her ergonomic neck pillow, cleverly reflecting her own "winking pop persona" and the interpretations of her album art. Through her opening monologue and a "girlboss" seminar sketch, Carpenter directly addressed and dismissed criticisms regarding her sexuality and artistic choices. The article concludes that Carpenter is highly self-aware, preferring to engage with the discourse humorously, thus challenging the often-judgmental perceptions of young female artists transitioning from child stardom.</p>

          <p>England clinched a spot in the Women's World Cup semi-finals, defeating co-hosts India by a thrilling four-run margin in Indore. India, set a target of 289, appeared to be cruising at 234-3, propelled by opener Smriti Mandhana's impressive 88, until her crucial dismissal in the 42nd over triggered a significant batting collapse. England's competitive total of 288-8 was largely built on former captain Heather Knight's masterful 86-ball century, complemented by Amy Jones's half-century. Despite a late-innings wobble in their batting, England's bowlers, particularly Linsey Smith in the decisive final over, demonstrated composure under pressure to secure a vital victory as the tournament approaches its crunch time.</p>

          <p>A trip to San Francisco yielded ten key insights from CEOs on AI, stocks, and the broader market. Salesforce's AI platform, Agentforce, is proving effective in streamlining businesses without reducing legacy software use, leading to raised revenue projections. Concerns are growing about OpenAI's consumer product focus and spending, though Broadcom's CEO remains a strong believer. The AI buildout is seen as a non-zero-sum game, benefiting multiple chipmakers. Investment advice includes selling nuclear and quantum stocks due to lack of commercial readiness and buying Dell if prices drop. Lastly, Levi Strauss is experiencing growth in its women's line, and San Francisco itself shows nascent signs of economic recovery and improved safety. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southeast Asia has made considerable strides in reducing smoking prevalence, dropping from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, a success largely due to robust public health policies including increased taxation, advertising prohibitions, and public smoking restrictions. Despite this progress, the total number of smokers has paradoxically risen due to significant population growth. The region also faces challenges, notably in Indonesia, which has one of the highest male tobacco use rates globally and recently scrapped a planned tobacco tax hike due to industry lobbying. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of e-cigarettes presents a new public health dilemma, with several nations implementing outright bans to prevent youth vaping and avoid creating a new generation of nicotine users.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to reinstate student loan forgiveness under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans, following an agreement with the American Federation of Teachers. This development re-establishes a path to debt relief for millions of borrowers who were previously impacted by the administration's pause on some income-driven repayment (IDR) programs. The earlier pause was attributed to court orders concerning the SAVE plan, but advocates argued this interpretation was too broad. Crucially, the agreement also confirms that borrowers qualifying for forgiveness in 2025 will be exempt from federal taxes on their relief, addressing a significant concern as the relevant tax-free treatment law is set to expire.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is poised for a new political era as a presidential run-off election features two conservative candidates, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, signaling a decisive shift from two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party governance.

Both candidates pledge to stabilize the economy, address the exchange rate, and attract foreign investment, though their approaches differ, particularly on seeking IMF assistance. The election's outcome is anticipated to realign Bolivia's international relationships, moving away from China and Russia to foster stronger ties with the United States, as both contenders have already engaged with President Trump.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has indicated that the government is actively considering a reduction in the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, in response to the ongoing "cost-of-living crisis." Although he refrained from pre-empting November's Budget announcement, Miliband confirmed that "all of these issues" are under review to alleviate financial pressure on households. The Labour party previously committed to lowering average energy bills by £300 annually by 2030, a pledge Miliband reiterated. Such a VAT cut could save the average household £86 per year, though it would cost the Treasury an estimated £2.5 billion. Additionally, discussions are reportedly underway regarding the reduction of regulatory levies currently added to energy bills.</p>

          <p>Green Party leader Zack Polanski has vigorously defended his party's proposed wealth tax, which includes an annual levy of 1% on assets exceeding £10 million and 2% on assets over £1 billion, as a crucial step towards "tackling the deep inequality in our society." Polanski estimates this tax could raise between £15 billion and £25 billion annually, although critics warn it might discourage investment and lead to an exodus of wealthy individuals. He stressed that the core objective is to reduce societal inequality, rather than solely funding public investments, and also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax. Since Polanski's election, the party has seen an 80% surge in membership, reportedly now exceeding that of the Conservative Party.</p>
