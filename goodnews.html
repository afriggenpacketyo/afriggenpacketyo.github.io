          <p>Rwanda is reportedly in discussions with the United States regarding the potential acceptance of migrants deported by the Trump administration. Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe stated that talks are ongoing but remain in the early stages. The State Department emphasized its commitment to implementing the Trump administration's immigration policies and collaborating with foreign governments, while refraining from discussing diplomatic details publicly. Rwanda previously had a similar agreement with the United Kingdom, which was later scrapped.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent outlined President Donald Trump's economic agenda, emphasizing tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation, to a group of global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference. Bessent stated the administration's goal is to make America more appealing for investors. He believes the U.S. is close to trade deals, potentially with China, despite maintaining embargo-level tariffs. Trump's claim that numerous countries are eager to make deals with the U.S. was used to justify scaling back the reciprocal tariff plan.</p>

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand, focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade. GM President Mark Reuss has taken a special interest in Cadillac, overseeing a product renaissance aimed at regaining its prominence. The strategy involves largely isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands and prioritizing value over volume. Despite challenges in China and with EV production, Cadillac has largely stayed true to its plan, with executives describing the brand as having a never-ending finish line.</p>

The gala will be co-chaired by Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour, with LeBron James as honorary chair. The theme is significant as it marks the first time the Met is centering Black identity and Black designers. The exhibition, inspired by Monica L. Miller's book, "Slaves to Fashion," explores how Black people have used fashion as a tool of self-expression and power.</p>
