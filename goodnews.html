          <p>Oleksandr Usyk secured a decisive fifth-round knockout against Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium, reclaiming his status as the undisputed heavyweight champion for a second time. The Ukrainian fighter demonstrated superior skill, footwork, and power, knocking Dubois down twice before ending the bout with a powerful left hook. This victory solidifies Usyk's position as the leading heavyweight of his generation, joining Muhammad Ali as one of the only men to reign as undisputed heavyweight champion on two separate occasions. His performance is being widely praised as legendary within the boxing community.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a new target to reduce the number of sewage discharges from water companies by half by the year 2030. This pledge follows significant public anger over water pollution and comes after data revealed a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution, though critics note the target is a political promise rather than a legally binding commitment. The announcement precedes a major review of the water industry, which faces scrutiny over rising consumer bills and executive bonuses amid environmental failings.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao's return to the ring after a four-year retirement ended in a majority draw against WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in Las Vegas. One judge scored the fight for Barrios, while the other two scored it a draw, allowing Barrios to retain his title. The 46-year-old Pacquiao showed flashes of his former speed and skill but faded in the later rounds against his younger opponent. Despite the result, Pacquiao expressed that he felt he won the fight and is open to a rematch, citing his short two-month training camp as a factor.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin man, initially the prime suspect in his girlfriend's 2016 murder, was cleared thanks to data from his Fitbit activity tracker. Doug Detrie was arrested after his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, was found beaten and strangled, but his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was home and mostly asleep during the time of the murder. This case highlights the growing role of personal tech devices in criminal investigations. The data, along with DNA evidence found on the victim's clothing, ultimately led investigators to a different suspect, George Steven Burch, whose own phone's location data placed him at the crime scenes.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week in financial markets will be heavily focused on the European banking sector, with major lenders like Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank scheduled to report earnings. Market optimism is largely centered on these financial institutions to maintain positive momentum, even as other sectors face downgrades. Additionally, investors will be closely watching the European Central Bank's policy meeting. While the ECB is expected to keep interest rates on hold, its future actions may be influenced by the potential imposition of 30% tariffs on EU imports by the United States, creating a tense waiting game for markets.
