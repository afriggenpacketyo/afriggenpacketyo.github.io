          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have agreed to a decade-long, A$500 million ($328m) deal to bolster security and economic ties, described by leaders as a 'win-win situation.' The 'Nakamal agreement' is seen as part of Australia's broader strategy to counter China's growing influence in the Pacific region. The pact will fund the construction of data centers, support climate change resilience for the low-lying island nation, and enhance its security capabilities. This agreement follows similar deals Australia has recently signed with other Pacific neighbors, including the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.</p>

          <p>Photos of rabbits with black, horn-like growths circulating online have been confirmed as real by Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The animals are not 'zombie-rabbits' but are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively common and typically harmless disease spread by ticks, fleas, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact. The virus causes keratinous carcinomas to grow on the rabbits' bodies, which usually disappear as their immune system fights off the infection. This disease, which does not affect humans or other pets, is believed to be the origin of the mythical 'jackalope' legend.</p>

The strategy involves nearly doubling the studio's annual film output, focusing on major franchises like 'Top Gun,' 'Star Trek,' and 'Yellowstone,' and creating content for broad, non-politicized audiences. Ellison emphasized that movies will be made for theatrical release to maintain cultural significance. The new ownership, which includes Skydance Media and RedBird Capital, plans to be based in Hollywood and aims to make Paramount the top destination for creative talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, experienced record flooding after an 'outburst flood' from the Mendenhall Glacier, but the immediate threat has now passed as waters recede. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record, and prompted evacuations in the flood zone. The flooding is an annual event caused by the melting of a smaller glacier, which creates a basin that eventually overtops its ice dam. This year, newly installed temporary barriers, or 'Hesco' sandbags, were credited with successfully protecting hundreds of homes and preventing a 'catastrophic event.'</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that over half of business travelers are combining work trips with personal time, a trend known as 'bleisure.' Many are bringing partners, children, and friends along to save on vacation costs and reclaim family time that would otherwise be lost to work. While some employees worry about appearing unprofessional, many companies are quietly accepting of the practice, provided work objectives are met and personal expenses are kept separate. This growing trend, valued at over $315 billion, reflects a shift in work-life balance priorities in the post-pandemic era.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the Sandy Hook families. This move effectively strips Alex Jones of control over his brand and paves the way for the seizure of all company property, from equipment to the Infowars name itself. The families' lawyers expressed that this will finally bring accountability for Jones's cruel harassment. This shifts the collection efforts from federal bankruptcy court to state court, which may allow for a faster and more flexible process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for ADHD may have broader life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, based on over 148,000 people in Sweden, found that taking ADHD medication was associated with significant reductions in first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminality. Researchers believe this is because the medication helps reduce impulsivity and improves concentration. The findings provide important evidence on the potential risks of not treating ADHD, which could help patients and doctors in their decision-making process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to U.S. efforts to curb China's dominance in shipbuilding, South Korean firms are boosting their investments in Southeast Asia. Analysts suggest this strategy helps them overcome domestic constraints like labor shortages and high costs, thereby enhancing their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. As an example, HD Hyundai is investing $550 million to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines, with plans to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. This shift allows Korean companies to leverage the lower labor costs in the region to strengthen their market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain in a penalty shootout after conceding two late goals to squander a 2-0 lead. Despite the heartbreaking collapse, the performance showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For 85 minutes, Spurs displayed a pragmatic, organized, and efficient 3-5-2 system, with both of their goals coming from well-executed set-pieces, a hallmark of Frank's previous teams. While the late defensive frailty is a concern, the overall tactical approach suggests a clear new direction for the club's future.</p>
