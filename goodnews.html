          <p>The Green Bay Housing Authority is reviewing a proposal by SDG Housing Partners to renovate Monroe Plaza, an apartment complex for elderly and disabled residents. While the authority supports the renovation plans, some members have expressed concerns about the proposed property management by ACC Management Group, citing past experiences with disabled residents and communication issues. The developer plans to install new windows, an energy-efficient roof, and updated light fixtures, as well as add a gazebo, resident gardens, and ADA-compliant sidewalks, but the authority's final decision will depend on addressing management concerns.</p>

          <p>Friends, family, and community members are supporting Vanessa Rompa, the daughter of retired WBAY anchor Kevin Rompa, as she recovers from bacterial meningitis. Vanessa was hospitalized for seven weeks and spent two weeks on life support after being diagnosed with the condition, which developed from an ear infection. A fundraiser and a benefit happy hour are planned to help with the costs of her hospital stay and her inability to work, and a GoFundMe campaign has been established to raise funds for her recovery. The Rompa family expressed gratitude for the community's outpouring of support.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts in 2024, certificate of deposit (CD) rates remain competitive, offering returns significantly higher than traditional savings accounts. As of June 24, 2025, the highest CD rate is 5.5% APY, offered by Gainbridge¬Æ on its 5-year CD, which requires a $1000 minimum opening deposit. Historically, longer-term CDs have offered higher interest rates, but this pattern doesn‚Äôt necessarily hold today, with the highest average CD rate for a 12-month term. When choosing a CD, consider factors beyond just the APY, such as the term length and any potential penalties for early withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As jacaranda trees bloom throughout Los Angeles, fire victims hope their purple flowers will return too, as they signify warmer days. Despite significant bark char and crown damage, jacarandas are highly heat-tolerant and are generally planted among low grasses, limiting the potential for upward burn. However, construction activities and Zone 0 regulations may pose threats to the trees' recovery, and some residents are more distraught about losing their trees than their homes. Residents can improve their trees‚Äô chances of recovery by ensuring they receive adequate water and by pruning dead branches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Literacy experts suggest that parents should not teach their 3-year-olds how to read, as children at that age learn language best through play and interaction with caregivers. While children can learn individual letters at a young age, it is not developmentally appropriate, and oral language skills are more valuable at this stage. Research suggests that ages 5 to 7 are the prime time to teach reading, as it requires a level of brain development that is not yet sufficient in younger children. Focusing on play, exploration, and language development in the early years can better prepare children for reading later on.</p>

          <p>The article delves into Senator Chris Murphy's intellectual journey and his advocacy for economic populism, noting his interest in the new right and his critique of neoliberalism. Murphy's shift from gun-control advocate to economic populist is examined, highlighting his belief that the Democratic Party can regain working-class support by calling out powerful corporate villains. The article explores the challenges Murphy faces in convincing his colleagues to adopt a more confrontational style and the skepticism from a party that is still uncomfortable with class-conscious politics. He is attempting to prevent his colleagues from giving in to that temptation.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target to spend 5% of GDP on national security by 2035. Of that 5%, 3.5% is allocated to core defense, and the remaining 1.5% will go to defense-related areas such as resilience and security. The split target is aimed at placating US President Donald Trump, who has urged NATO allies to spend more, while giving cash-strapped EU countries flexibility over how they meet the target. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel accused ministers of announcing the target with "no new money" to fund it.</p>
