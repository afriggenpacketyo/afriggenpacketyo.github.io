          <p>Nvidia and AMD have entered an unusual agreement with the U.S. government to share 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. In exchange, the companies will receive export licenses for specific chips, including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308, which were previously restricted. Analysts describe the deal as a transactional approach by the Trump administration, effectively an "indirect tariff at source" for doing business in China. While creating some long-term uncertainty, investors have reacted positively, viewing 85% of potential revenue as preferable to zero access to the lucrative Chinese market.

The investment is part of the company's "Universal EV Program," which aims to produce more affordable electric vehicles to compete with international manufacturers. The first vehicle from this initiative will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch with a target starting price of $30,000. Ford emphasized that the new lithium iron phosphate batteries for these EVs will be assembled in the U.S., not imported from China.</p>

          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion, starting in 2026.

This marks a strategic shift away from the traditional pay-per-view model, aiming to drive subscriber growth for Paramount+.

          <p>Amazon's ambitious satellite internet initiative, Project Kuiper, is showing signs of becoming a significant future revenue stream for the tech giant, despite not yet being commercially launched. The project aims to compete with SpaceX's Starlink by providing broadband to hundreds of millions of households in underserved areas globally. Even before its commercial debut, Kuiper has secured enterprise and government contracts, and its development is seen as a way to onboard new customers to Amazon's Prime and AWS ecosystems. While requiring over $10 billion in upfront investment, analysts see parallels to the successful long-term growth of Amazon Web Services. (not investment advice)</p>

The events aim to strengthen community engagement, recruit volunteers, and develop local strategies to ensure high voter turnout.

          <p>With interest rates still relatively high, experts are advising on the best placement for savings, comparing high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) and certificates of deposit (CDs). HYSAs are recommended for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer easy access to cash without penalties. Conversely, CDs are suggested for those who want to lock in a guaranteed higher interest rate for a set period, which is advantageous if rates are expected to fall. For individuals seeking a balance, some experts recommend a "CD ladder" strategy or splitting funds between both account types to combine liquidity with higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

While many cannabis stocks are still far below their all-time highs, the news sparked investor optimism about the future of the roughly $80 billion market.

          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield match against Crystal Palace showcased both the promise of its new offensive players and potential defensive frailties. New signings Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz had encouraging debuts, contributing to the team's attack, but the team appeared defensively open, a recurring theme in their pre-season games. The team is adapting to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, and the absence of key midfielders highlighted vulnerabilities in their aggressive man-to-man pressing system. While the new signings offer exciting possibilities, the analysis suggests Liverpool may face a period of adjustment and defensive uncertainty early in the campaign.</p>
