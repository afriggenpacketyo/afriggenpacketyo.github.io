          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026. In a public statement, Harris expressed her love for her home state but concluded that her future in public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision follows months of speculation about her next political move after her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris indicate she is considering other avenues for public engagement, such as writing a book and campaigning for Democrats, while keeping the option of a 2028 presidential run open.</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has launched a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal action over expressing their faith. The fund was created using settlement money from BGEA's own legal victories in the U.K., supplemented by a contribution from Samaritan's Purse. Franklin Graham and his daughter, Cissie Graham Lynch, emphasized that the initiative aims to combat the silencing of religious expression, a trend they see growing in both Europe and the United States. They highlighted the importance of protecting religious freedom and free speech against cultural and legal pressures.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approached, several teams made significant moves to strengthen their bullpens for the postseason push. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired highly-sought closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins in a major deal involving top prospects. In another key trade, the New York Mets bolstered their relief corps by acquiring submarine pitcher Tyler Rogers from the Giants and reliever Ryan Helsley from the Cardinals. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Reds added Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pirates, signaling a busy period of transactions as teams finalized their rosters.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade agreement, establishing a 15% tariff on South Korean goods, including automobiles and semiconductors, thereby avoiding a threatened 25% levy. As part of the deal, South Korea has committed to investing $350 billion in the U.S., with a significant portion directed toward the American shipbuilding industry. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung praised the agreement for providing economic certainty and maintaining a competitive position against other trade partners. Notably, Seoul successfully protected its sensitive rice and beef markets from further U.S. imports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the expensive and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company argues its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, offers a more efficient and less risky alternative to Heathrow's own, more costly plan. This development introduces competition into the long-debated expansion project for the first time, with the government now set to review both bids.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, maintaining the current range despite pressure from President Donald Trump to implement cuts. The decision reflects a mixed economic landscape, with policymakers weighing concerns about the potential inflationary impact of new tariffs against signs of slowing momentum. While the move was largely expected, it was marked by an unusual dissent from two board members who favored a rate cut, indicating a broadening debate within the central bank. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized a cautious approach, stating the full effects of the administration's trade policies are not yet clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed vibrant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed dense beds of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that these chemosynthetic communities are more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into how organisms adapt to the planet's harshest conditions.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue that concrete evidence is lacking. While many parents and some experts worry about links to depression and behavioral issues, critics like Professor Pete Etchells point out flaws in existing research, such as reliance on self-reporting and mistaking correlation for causation. They argue that the term "screen time" is too broad and fails to distinguish between different types of digital engagement. This ongoing scientific debate leaves parents with inconsistent guidance, highlighting the complexity of understanding technology's true effect on child development.</p>

          <p>Advanced imaging technology has provided an unprecedented look at the complex tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female mummy from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution scans revealed detailed decorations of animals and mythical creatures that were previously indistinct, showcasing a high level of sophistication. Researchers collaborated with a tattooist specializing in ancient methods to analyze the work, concluding that the tattoos were likely stenciled and created with multi-pointed tools. The findings offer new insights into the cultural practices and artistic skill of this ancient nomadic warrior society.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Why Massive Russian Quake Caused Limited Tsunami Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little tsunami damage across the Pacific. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this fortunate outcome. The main energy of the resulting tsunami was projected into a relatively empty stretch of the open ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching populated coastlines like California. While the event triggered widespread alerts, it served as a best-case scenario for a distant, powerful earthquake, avoiding a major catastrophe.</p>
