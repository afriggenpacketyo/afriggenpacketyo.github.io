          <h2>Nvidia CEO Addresses US Concerns Over Chip Use by Chinese Military</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:07:11 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly dismissed U.S. concerns regarding the potential use of his company's advanced artificial intelligence chips by the Chinese military, ahead of an upcoming trip to China. Huang contended that China cannot reliably depend on U.S.-made technology due to the risk of limitations, and already possesses ample computing capacity, making Nvidia's chips unnecessary for their military development. He reiterated his view that current export controls are counterproductive to U.S. tech leadership, as they restrict engagement with a global pool of AI developers, with half located in China. The article highlights that Washington's latest restrictions are expected to cause billions in losses for Nvidia, forcing the company to navigate a complex geopolitical tightrope to balance national security interests with maintaining global market access.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Avoids Recession Amid Manufacturing Growth, Forecasts Uneven Recovery</h2>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully averting a technical recession after a Q1 contraction, and surpassed expectations with a 4.3% year-over-year increase. This growth was primarily driven by the manufacturing sector, which benefited from a temporary pause in "reciprocal tariffs" and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, alongside a construction boom. Despite these positive GDP figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant global economic uncertainty and downside risks for the latter half of 2025, particularly due to a lack of clarity on U.S. tariff policies. Analysts note the volatile trade environment and the need for potential fiscal stimulus, with some expecting a slowdown in the second half, while others are more optimistic about overall 2025 growth.

          <h2>Archaeologists Discover Multistory Structures in Ancient Egyptian City of Imet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:00:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British archaeologists, collaborating with experts from the University of Sadat City, have unearthed multistory buildings and other significant structures within the ruins of the ancient Egyptian city of Imet, located in the Nile Delta. Employing remote sensing and satellite imagery, the team discovered substantial tower houses and granaries, dating to the Ptolemaic Period (332 B.C. - 30 B.C.), which indicate a thriving and densely populated urban center with complex infrastructure. The excavation also revealed a ceremonial road connected to the cult of Wadjet, animal enclosures, and various artifacts, providing fresh insights into the city's urban planning, religious landscapes, and economic life. This article emphasizes that Imet is emerging as a crucial site for re-evaluating the archaeology of Late Period Egypt.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Governor, Andrew Bailey, has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market demonstrates significant signs of slowing down, reinforcing his belief that the path for rates is "downward." With the next review set for August 7th, many economists anticipate a cut from the current 4.25%, which directly impacts mortgages, credit cards, and savings rates for millions. Bailey explained that the UK economy's growth below its potential is creating "slack," aiding inflation reduction, and observed consistent signs of businesses adjusting employment and offering smaller pay rises. This article highlights that the central bank is closely monitoring economic indicators, including recent dips in job vacancies and a jump in available workers, for further monetary policy adjustments.

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing expectations, driven by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary reprieve from U.S. tariffs that eased the decline in goods sent to America. Imports also saw their first growth this year, climbing 1.1%, despite missing economists' forecasts. The article highlights a significant surge in rare earth shipments by 60% to a record high, alongside increases in steel, integrated circuits, cars, and ships exports. While the first half of the year showed upbeat trade data, economists caution that export momentum could falter due to ongoing U.S. tariff uncertainty, necessitating potential fiscal stimulus.

This new initiative, often referred to as "neijuan" or involution, presents distinct challenges compared to the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" that focused on eliminating industrial overcapacity, given China's altered economic landscape. Analysts indicate that factors such as a greater presence of private firms, weaker overall economic growth, and limited fiscal space will complicate Beijing's efforts to effectively curb this phenomenon.
