          <p>The UK government is planning significant road safety reforms, including mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70. This proposal follows a coroner's report calling the UK's licensing system one of Europe's laxest. The new strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's stricter standard. Other potential changes include introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers and simplifying drug-driving prosecutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, the article explains that newly formed ones emit a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. When a black hole is created, for instance from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in space-time vibrates and settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. These vibrations, known as quasinormal modes, are like pure tones that scientists can detect and study. This phenomenon offers a way to observe the otherwise imperceptible final moments of a black hole's formation.</p>

          <h2>China's New Childcare Subsidy Program May Disproportionately Benefit Poorer Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three years old. The initiative is an expansion of pilot programs already active in over 20 provinces. Analysts suggest the subsidy's impact will be most significant in less affluent regions where the handout represents a larger percentage of average income. For example, the subsidy is over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in Gansu province, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates in rural areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly reached an agreement with the U.S. government to secure export licenses for sales to China. The deal requires the companies to pay 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in China back to the U.S. government. This arrangement applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export restrictions. The development signals a potential easing of trade tensions as Washington and Beijing navigate complex economic and security concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The changes aim to simplify regulations, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated need rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This action addresses concerns that there are significantly more graduates than available jobs in some areas, a situation exacerbated by record training numbers during the pandemic. Nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move but noted its success depends on actual job creation.</p>

Meanwhile, competing quarterback Taylor Heinicke struggled in his first preseason action. The Chargers' defense also shined, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>
