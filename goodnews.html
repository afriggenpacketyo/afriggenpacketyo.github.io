          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, citing that he is not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, was initially held under a determination by the Secretary of State but remained detained on allegations of omitting details from his green card application. The judge dismissed the government's request to stay the decision, stating that Khalil's detention appeared to be an effort to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. The White House plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The judge ruled that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The policy was deemed arbitrary and lacking specificity, undermining the states' ability to maintain roads and infrastructure. The administration argues that these policies hinder efforts to apprehend undocumented immigrants, while some jurisdictions say that forcing local police to cooperate with ICE could reduce trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The interest-earning potential of CDs and money market accounts are similar, especially in today's cooling rate climate, but not identical.

Depending on the term length and lender, a $10,000 deposit could earn slightly more with a CD or a money market account. Savers should weigh the guaranteed interest of a CD against the potential for slightly higher earnings with a money market account. (not investment advice)</p>
