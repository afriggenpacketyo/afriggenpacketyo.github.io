          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize economic relations with Beijing. This shift follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential recalibration of Seoul's foreign policy. While Lee's party is considered more friendly toward China and North Korea, continuity is expected in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. Under Yoon, Seoul emphasized its commitment to the US alliance and stronger cooperation with Washington and Tokyo.</p>

          <p>While tech billionaires focus on optimizing themselves to live longer, healthier lives, life expectancy is decreasing in many high-income countries. The emphasis on personal responsibility distracts from the impact of public policy, infrastructure, and community on health and longevity. Countries where people live longer normalize healthy living through government and culture, such as affordable nutritious food and clean air policies. Achieving a longer, healthier life requires collective responsibility and policies that prioritize the conditions for good health for everyone.</p>

          <p>A man in England discovered that he was swapped at birth in the hospital nearly 80 years ago after noticing he looked nothing like his parents. During the pandemic, the man began researching his family history and found DNA matches with unfamiliar relatives. Further investigation revealed that another baby boy was registered at the same hospital one day after his father's birth, leading to the realization that the babies were mixed up. This case is one of several instances of babies being accidentally switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s.</p>
