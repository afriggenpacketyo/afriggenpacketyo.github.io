          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist advises parents on how to say "no" in ways that foster connection and teach valuable life skills rather than creating conflict. The article suggests turning "no" into a teachable moment by providing alternatives, explaining the reasoning behind safety and kindness-based rules, and offering choices to give children a sense of autonomy. Consistency in enforcing boundaries is crucial for building trust and predictability, and parents are encouraged to repair interactions after reacting emotionally, ensuring limits and connection coexist.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has built a multi-million dollar wholesale clothing business, Technsports, which originated from his efforts to support his son after becoming unemployed in 2008. Starting by flipping a single cell phone on eBay, Senko grew his operation by meticulously studying brands and market trends, eventually focusing on pre-owned clothing. In 2023, he pivoted from individual online sales to a wholesale model, selling bulk used clothing to other resellers, which generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024 with a significant profit margin.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, asserts that the concept of work-life balance for entrepreneurs is "the biggest line of bulls--- that’s ever been created." He argues that building a business from nothing requires an intense, all-consuming work ethic, reflecting on his own journey of turning a $25,000 loan into a brand valued at billions. Liautaud, who sold his majority stake in 2016, emphasizes that success in entrepreneurship demands a "grinder" mentality, a perspective shared by other successful figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk in their early careers.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," has sold for approximately $37 million at the Drouot auction house in Paris. The painting, which had been in a private family collection since 1944 and hidden from public view, surpassed expectations and became the highest-priced artwork sold at auction in France this year. The work captures Maar near the end of her tumultuous relationship with Picasso, and its vivid colors were a surprise to experts who had only seen it in a black-and-white photograph.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic soccer champion Abby Wambach suggests that parents should not attend their children's sports practices to help them develop resilience and internal motivation. In a recent interview, she argued that a parent's presence on the sidelines can make a child anxious or overly driven to impress, hindering their ability to take risks and learn from mistakes. Wambach believes that allowing children to engage with coaches and teammates independently fosters self-starting qualities, and advises that during games, parents should focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship rather than performance outcomes.</p>

          <p>A family in West Virginia experienced a medical odyssey after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, exhibited troubling symptoms, leading to a diagnosis and successful brain surgery that dramatically improved her disposition. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after displaying various symptoms, each requiring surgical intervention. A pediatric neurosurgeon noted that while a genetic link exists in about 10% of cases, having four siblings affected is highly unusual.</p>

The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medications by law enforcement globally, including thousands of unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide pens. Officials warned that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging the public to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies.

          <p>Although recent AI advancements like OpenAI's Sora 2 video generator have caused panic in Hollywood over potential job losses and copyright infringement, the technology's actual integration into the industry has been slow and challenging.

While AI is being used for some tasks like dubbing and animation, it has not yet replaced creative roles or delivered on its promise to revolutionize filmmaking, remaining more of a curiosity than an existential threat for now.</p>

Starboard is urging Fluor to monetize this investment, possibly through a sale or a tax-free spinoff, which could lead to a significant rerating of Fluor's stock and provide substantial returns for shareholders.
