          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy troops domestically amid rising urban crime, a possibility confirmed by Vice-President JD Vance. Concurrently, President Trump announced that the war in Gaza was 'over' as he departed for Jerusalem to speak at the Knesset and meet with hostage families. He claimed to have brokered a major peace deal that would normalize Middle East relations. These developments signal a dual focus on domestic security and international diplomacy, with the President asserting a significant role in both.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have announced a revised pitching plan for the National League Championship Series, pushing Shohei Ohtani's next start to later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts stated Yoshinobu Yamamoto will pitch Game 2 instead of Ohtani, allowing Yamamoto to maintain his regular five-day rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This adjustment means Ohtani will likely make only one pitching start in the NLCS, potentially allowing him to focus on improving his hitting performance after a challenging NLDS. The team prioritizes maximizing innings from its best pitchers.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for a "winter-like" storm expected to bring significant rainfall from late Monday through Wednesday. The National Weather Service forecasts three-quarters to 1.5 inches of rain, with mountain areas potentially receiving up to 3.5 inches. Rainfall rates could exceed half an inch per hour, prompting flood watches for burn areas. This early-season storm, despite the official return of La Niña which typically brings drought, is a notable weather event. It could create commuter challenges and highlights the region's vulnerability to intense precipitation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump declared the "war is over" in Gaza as he headed to a peace summit in Egypt, where all remaining living hostages held by Hamas are expected to be released. Israel is prepared to free approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange. The summit, co-chaired by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to secure a lasting peace. Germany has pledged millions for Gaza's reconstruction, while Iran has declined to attend the summit, citing US strikes on its nuclear facilities. The international community is focused on aid distribution and rebuilding the devastated territory.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often becomes a challenge amidst busy lives, leading to a phenomenon known as 'ghosting' where connections fade. Research indicates individuals lose about half their friends every seven years due to shifting life stages like marriage, career focus, or starting families. Experts emphasize honest communication, vulnerability, and creative approaches to spending time together, even through mundane activities. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco highlights 'relational loneliness' and the importance of in-person interactions, suggesting reframing social connection as a muscle that strengthens with use. Trusting that friends are more liked than perceived is crucial for rekindling bonds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, revealing that a drop in nose temperature can serve as an objective measure of stress levels. During an experimental stress test involving impromptu speeches and mental arithmetic, participants' noses consistently showed a temperature decrease of three to six degrees, including a two-degree drop for a BBC correspondent. This physiological response, where blood flow is redirected from the nose to eyes and ears to detect danger, offers a non-invasive method for monitoring stress. Researchers believe this technique could be a "game changer" for managing harmful stress and assessing well-being in humans and non-human apes.</p>

The summit, co-chaired by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to move towards "phase two" of the truce. Despite claims by UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson about Britain's "key role," U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee dismissed them as "delusional," highlighting diplomatic tensions over credit for the peace deal.</p>

          <p>Dow futures surged over 300 points, signaling a potential market rebound, after President Trump's calming remarks on Truth Social regarding U.S.-China trade tensions. Following his earlier threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump posted, "Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!" Vice President Vance also suggested a willingness to be reasonable. Analysts interpret this as another instance of the "TACO (Trump always chickens out) trade," where markets anticipate de-escalation after maximalist threats. This perspective suggests the recent dip in equities might be a buying opportunity, with the path of least resistance continuing higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, has opened bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, a potential merger poised to significantly reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid expected. David Ellison, who recently acquired a controlling stake in Paramount, is spearheading this audacious move, aiming to consolidate content in a market dominated by streaming giants. The merger could lead to the elimination of one of Hollywood's original film studios and the consolidation of news divisions, despite Warner Bros.' recent box office successes.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping signals India's potential strategy to hedge its bets on China amidst growing tensions with the U.S. Modi and Xi agreed that the two Asian powers should be "partners" rather than "rivals," emphasizing the need for "strategic autonomy" and a resolution to their border dispute. This diplomatic shift, underscored by the resumption of direct flights, represents India's effort to reset historically fraught ties with China. The move aims to forge a coalition of eastern powers and anchor a multipolar global order, despite President Trump's tough stance on India.</p>
