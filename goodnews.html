          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 08:53:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is introducing prescription drug kiosks in its One Medical clinics across Los Angeles, allowing patients to receive common medications like antibiotics and inhalers almost immediately after their appointments. The initiative aims to improve patient convenience and medication adherence by eliminating the need for a separate trip to a pharmacy. Operated by Amazon Pharmacy, these machines are part of the company's broader strategy to expand its footprint in the healthcare industry and disrupt the traditional pharmacy model, which has seen major chains like Rite Aid and Walgreens struggle with declining profits and store closures. The service requires a remote pharmacist to verify each order before the medication is dispensed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating former FBI Director James Comey have concluded that their central witness, law professor Daniel Richman, would be problematic for their case, according to sources familiar with the matter. Richman reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously, directly undermining the indictment's core allegation that Comey lied to Congress. This development has led Justice Department officials to privately express concerns that the case, which alleges false statements and obstruction, could unravel. The indictment was pursued by a Trump-appointed prosecutor despite internal recommendations against moving forward due to insufficient evidence and potential statute of limitations issues.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders reacted to the team's decision to trade veteran Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals, a move that positions Sanders as the primary backup to starter Dillon Gabriel. Sanders expressed his gratitude for Flacco's mentorship, describing him as a source of wisdom who helped him significantly during his time in Cleveland. He mentioned that he was happy for Flacco and his new opportunity, noting the veteran's ability to adjust to any situation. The trade places more responsibility on Sanders and leaves Bailey Zappe as the remaining veteran presence in the quarterbacks' room, though he is currently on the practice squad.</p>

          <p>Verizon has signed a definitive commercial agreement with AST SpaceMobile to provide direct-to-device cellular service from space, set to begin next year. The partnership aims to extend Verizon's coverage to remote and underserved areas across the continental United States by leveraging its 850 MHz spectrum with AST's satellite network. This technology will allow standard cell phones to connect directly to satellites when out of range of terrestrial towers, ensuring connectivity for users on Verizon plans. Following the announcement, AST SpaceMobile's stock surged, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of its space-based broadband network to enhance global cellular service.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisors Highlight Qualified Charitable Distributions as a Key Tax Strategy for Retirees</h2>

          <p>Retirees aged 70½ and older can utilize a tax-efficient strategy known as qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) to make donations directly from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs). This move allows for a direct transfer of up to $108,000 annually to an eligible charity, with the distributed amount being excluded from the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI). By lowering their AGI, retirees can avoid higher Medicare premiums and satisfy their required minimum distributions (RMDs) without increasing their taxable income. Financial advisors describe QCDs as one of the most beneficial yet underutilized tax breaks, particularly for the 90% of filers who do not itemize deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will not approve a controversial European Union proposal for so-called "chat controls," which would allow authorities to scan private messages for illegal content before encryption. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig stated that such arbitrary surveillance should be "taboo in a democracy." In separate domestic policy news, Germany's cabinet has approved legislation that would grant federal police the authority to shoot down unmanned aerial systems, or drones, if they pose a threat. This move aims to bolster security capabilities, with further clarification expected on the role the German military might play in assisting police with drone threats.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is set to receive a significant donation of over 100 works of Austrian Expressionism from the family of renowned art dealer Otto Kallir. The gift will include the museum's first-ever paintings by celebrated artists Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, filling a major gap in its collection. Kallir, who fled Austria in 1938, was instrumental in introducing Austrian Expressionism to the United States through his New York gallery. The collection, which also features works by Oskar Kokoschka and others, will be transferred to LACMA over several years, solidifying the museum's standing as a leading institution for Germanic modernism.</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as “locking in” has gained popularity among Gen Z, who are committing to periods of intense focus to achieve personal and financial goals. The practice, which often involves self-imposed challenges like limiting screen time and adopting healthy habits, is seen as a reaction against the constant distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties of the current era. While some view it as a rebranded form of millennial hustle culture, others see it as a coping mechanism for a generation navigating a competitive job market and the isolating effects of the pandemic. The trend reflects a desire for control and self-improvement in uncertain times.</p>

          <p>Championship club Watford has sacked head coach Paulo Pezzolano after only 10 games and has reappointed former manager Javi Gracia. Pezzolano was the 12th boss to lead the club since Gracia's first tenure ended in 2019, a period marked by high managerial turnover. Despite recent improvements in results, the club's leadership expressed confidence that Gracia's experience and leadership would bring much-needed stability and unity to the young squad. Gracia's popular first spell from 2018 to 2019 saw Watford achieve its best-ever Premier League finish and reach an FA Cup final, and his return is expected to be well-received by supporters.</p>

Ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, Root stated that such criticisms are irrelevant and that the focus should be on the team's performance and the final scoreline. Despite a respectable batting average in Australia, his highest score remains 89. Now free from the burden of captaincy, Root feels he has a better understanding of his game and is optimistic about England's chances, highlighting the team's new, aggressive approach and a formidable fast-bowling attack.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a mathematics professor who was diagnosed with autism in their 30s reflects on the challenges and strengths that come with being neurodivergent. The author argues against the narrative that treats autism as a tragedy to be eliminated, highlighting how autistic traits like persistence and pattern recognition have been beneficial in their academic career. The article draws parallels to historical figures like Isaac Newton, suggesting their neurodivergence was integral to their genius. The author makes a powerful case for embracing difference, framing the conversation not as one about defects, but about the value that diverse ways of thinking bring to society.</p>
