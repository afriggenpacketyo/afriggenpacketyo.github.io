          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary, Horizon Air, experienced a temporary system-wide ground stop for approximately three hours due to a significant IT outage. The airline confirmed the issue began around 8 p.m. Pacific time and was resolved by 11 p.m., allowing flights to resume. The carrier apologized for the disruption, warning travelers of potential residual delays as it works to reposition aircraft and crews. The Federal Aviation Administration had issued advisories during the event, though the specific cause of the computer failure was not immediately disclosed.</p>

          <p>Investors in China are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in this category past US$50 billion. This surge is driven by a search for lower-cost, diversified investments in an economic environment marked by deflation and supportive government policies. These ETFs offer better liquidity and lower default risks compared to direct corporate debt investment, appealing to investors hedging against economic uncertainty. The trend highlights a broader shift towards low-risk, fixed-income assets as China's central bank maintains loose monetary conditions while warning against risks from an over-extended bond rally.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage new domestic investment and restore economic confidence. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to counter two years of recession and a bleak economic forecast for 2025. The government has already approved significant tax relief and a €500 billion fund for infrastructure and climate projects. This summit underscores the government's strategy that while public funding is leading the way, private sector participation is crucial for reviving Germany's struggling economy.

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has traveled to Barcelona to complete a season-long loan move to the Spanish club. The 27-year-old player arrived on Sunday after United granted him permission to finalize the deal, which includes an option to buy. This move follows Rashford's expressed desire for a new challenge after being dropped by his coach at United. He is expected to undergo a medical exam early this week and could potentially join Barcelona's pre-season tour in Asia, marking his second consecutive loan spell after a period with Aston Villa.</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, following the completion of critical railway lines and port facilities by Chinese companies. For years, logistical challenges, such as the lack of infrastructure connecting mines to ports, have hindered exports from these African nations. In Guinea, the Simandou project, a joint venture with mining giant Rio Tinto, is expected to start shipments by November. Similarly, a new railway will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara to Mediterranean ports, unlocking a significant new source of iron ore for China.</p>

The squad for this midweek game includes nine Scottish players and all of the recent "geography" call-ups, giving them a chance to impress. The match serves as an opportunity for players on the fringe of the Test team to stake their claim for a spot in the upcoming second Test.</p>

          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a formidable competitor across the entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded beyond its telecom roots into smart cars, operating systems, and critical AI technologies like advanced chips and large language models. This diversification was partly a forced pivot due to external pressures, turning Huawei into a "jack of all trades" that even Nvidia's CEO calls a major competitor. The U.S. sanctions ironically fueled Huawei's rise as a state-backed national champion, accelerating its development of a complete AI hardware and software stack.</p>

          <p>The northeastern Chinese city of Hegang, once a thriving coal-mining hub, is gambling on a new airport and increased trade with Russia to revive its struggling economy. The city has faced years of industrial decline and a shrinking population, with its GDP also decreasing recently. The new Luobei Airport, backed by a 1.2 billion yuan investment, is scheduled to open in 2027 and is expected to handle 450,000 passengers annually. This infrastructure project is part of a broader strategy by smaller Chinese cities to seek economic breakthroughs and improve connectivity to catch up with more prosperous urban areas.

His gang is blamed for transforming Ecuador into a hub for cocaine trafficking and is suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. The extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadoreans approved the measure, supporting President Daniel Noboa's vow to crack down on the country's rampant crime.</p>

          <p>A class of popular weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s, including Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing significant potential for treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients in trials and anecdotal reports describe improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain, which are often linked to insulin resistance, a key feature of PCOS. While there is no standard treatment for the condition, these drugs may help by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, which in turn can help regulate hormones. Further research and overcoming insurance hurdles are key next steps.</p>
