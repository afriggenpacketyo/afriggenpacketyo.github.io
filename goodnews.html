          <p>A Cambridge professor debunks common myths about cooking oils, clarifying that sunflower and vegetable oils are healthy options, low in saturated fats and high in beneficial polyunsaturated fats, contrary to some negative press. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy due to near-zero trans fats. The article explains that extra virgin olive oil is better for dressings due to its low smoke point, while vegetable or sunflower oil is suitable for deep frying.</p>

Odegaard's influential performance in the 2-0 Champions League win over Olympiacos, contributing to both goals, underscored his importance despite a shoulder injury earlier in the season. Arteta emphasizes that this creative freedom is inherent to the 26-year-old Norwegian midfielder's nature and vital for the team's success.</p>

          <p>Despite the US government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs, as investors appear unfazed. Historical data from 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 indicates they typically have a modest impact on financial markets and the economy, especially if brief, with the S&P 500 gaining an average of 0.3% during closures. However, analysts caution that a prolonged shutdown could shake investor confidence and halt the release of critical economic data, potentially affecting future growth. (not investment advice)</p>
