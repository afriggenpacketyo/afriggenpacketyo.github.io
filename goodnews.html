          <h2>Options for Medical Debt Relief Expand for Struggling Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 11:20:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 million Americans are currently burdened by a collective $220 billion in medical debt, prompting many to seek relief options. Federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to offer charity care, providing free or discounted services to individuals and families below certain income thresholds relative to the federal poverty level. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances, though this may impact credit scores. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure medical debt, but this carries significant long-term financial consequences.</p>

AQR's performance highlights its ability to navigate market volatility through its value and momentum-based strategies.

          <p>Official statistics from England and Wales show a 14.2% increase in the number of babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in 2024 compared to the previous year. This notable demographic shift occurred alongside a slight overall rise in births in England for the first time since 2021, though birth rates in Wales continued to decline. The data also confirms a continuing trend of people delaying parenthood, with a decrease in births to mothers under the age of 30. Experts find the increase in older fathers particularly interesting given that male fertility generally declines with age.</p>

        </div>

          <p>NYU Stern professor and author Suzy Welch advises job seekers to ask, 'What kind of person should not work at this company?' to reveal a potential employer's true values. She argues that this question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers than direct inquiries about company culture, cutting through corporate platitudes. Responses like 'a person who doesn't want to text on weekends' or 'someone who is too social' provide genuine insight into the actual work environment. Welch suggests saving this disarming question for the end of the interview process, once rapport has been established with the hiring manager.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company announced a 14.2% increase in new vehicle sales for the second quarter compared to the previous year, far exceeding the industry's estimated 1.4% growth. The automaker sold over 612,000 vehicles, with strong performances from its F-Series trucks and a notable rise in hybrid vehicle sales. While sales of fully electric vehicles saw a decline, the overall 'electrified' category, including hybrids, grew by 6.6%, setting a first-half record for the company. Analysts note these strong figures emerged despite potential market impacts from recently implemented tariffs on imported vehicles and parts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Spanish international goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from rival club Chelsea for a fee of ¬£5 million. The 30-year-old, who remains the world's most expensive goalkeeper following his 2018 transfer to Chelsea, joins the Gunners on a three-year contract. Kepa spent last season on loan at Bournemouth and previously had a successful loan spell at Real Madrid. His arrival at the Emirates Stadium is expected to provide experienced competition for Arsenal's current number one, David Raya, strengthening the team's goalkeeping depth ahead of the new season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies 'front-loading' inventory by stocking up on goods before the tariffs took effect. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing initial cost increases or using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments, all while waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy. However, experts caution that these are temporary buffers and expect prices to rise in the latter half of the year as these strategies are exhausted (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'Literary Kink' and its Place in Contemporary Fiction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 09:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the mainstreaming of kink in literature, moving from a taboo subject to an established genre with its own canon and conventions. It reviews Brittany Newell's novel 'Soft Core,' which centers on a San Francisco sex worker, as a prime example of this evolution. The article argues that while nonfiction about BDSM often aims to normalize and demystify the subculture, fiction like Newell's can explore the complex psychology, emotion, and loneliness within these worlds more freely. It positions 'Soft Core' as a literary work that delves into the feeling-tones of transactional relationships and existential searching.</p>
