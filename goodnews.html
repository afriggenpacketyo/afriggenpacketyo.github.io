          <p>Southwest Airlines will implement a $35 fee for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, a move influenced by activist investor pressure. This change accompanies the introduction of basic economy tickets, restricting changes, boarding priority, and credit expiration. Exemptions include top-tier loyalty members, Business Select fares, and co-branded credit cardholders. To accommodate anticipated increased carry-ons, Southwest is installing larger overhead bins and providing mobile bag tag printers for staff. These changes reflect a shift towards revenue generation strategies seen among competitors like Delta, American, and United Airlines.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation allowing U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the initial sale. This rule is particularly useful in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, where margins are greater. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. Italian luxury brand Moncler has cited the first sale rule as providing a "significant benefit" to its cost structure.</p>

          <p>Mary Earps, known for her significant role in England's Euro 2022 victory and her vice-captaincy at the 2023 World Cup, has left a "cool" legacy after her retirement. She earned individual accolades, including the FIFA Best Goalkeeper award and the Golden Glove at the 2023 World Cup. Earps used her platform to speak out about mental health and challenged Nike for not selling England women's goalkeeper shirts, leading to a reversal. She was honored with a plaque in her hometown and became the first female footballer to have a waxwork figure at Madame Tussauds.</p>
