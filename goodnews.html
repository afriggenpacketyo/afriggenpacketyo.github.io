          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to expand expedited removals across the entire country, citing significant due process concerns for migrants. The ruling pauses a directive that allowed immigration officials to deport certain non-citizens without a judicial hearing, a policy previously limited to border areas and recent arrivals. Judge Jia Cobb's decision emphasizes that while the expedited removal statute itself is not being questioned, its application to a much broader population living within the U.S. interior requires proper legal procedures to be followed.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has secured his place in the last 16 of the US Open after defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie in a four-set match. Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required two medical timeouts, the 24-time Grand Slam champion overcame the challenge to win 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3. This victory marks Norrie's seventh consecutive loss to Djokovic and ends British singles participation in the tournament.

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record by rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was fraught with challenges, including violent storms that swept one brother overboard temporarily. The trio beat the previous record of 162 days while raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. After arriving in Cairns, Australia, they expressed relief and looked forward to simple comforts like pizza and a proper bed.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to significant storm and fire damage. The scenic route, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was damaged by severe weather in 2022 and 2023, followed by the Bridge fire in 2024. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. While the reopening is celebrated by the hiking community, it coincides with heightened fire danger warnings for the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index hitting a 10-year high, is drawing back overseas investors and fueling optimism for a sustained rally. Investment managers point to several catalysts, including domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's strong push for technological innovation. Global asset managers believe Chinese equities have significant room for growth compared to other major markets trading at historical highs. They see "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI as a key driver for future investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit panel upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The court argued that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from shifting political pressures. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the decision, vowing to use every legal option to end what it calls a "de facto amnesty program."</p>

          <p>A unique mentoring program is helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them with toddlers from a local nursery. The scheme, run by the charity Power2, aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students. Participants like 13-year-old Siena have seen their school attendance more than double after taking part. The program's success is based on the idea that giving a disengaged teenager responsibility for a younger child can positively impact their own engagement with learning and school life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee giants like Costa are reportedly struggling as younger generations, the "matcha generation," increasingly favor trendier, visually appealing, and perceived healthier drinks from chains like Blank Street Coffee. This shift is driven by social media trends on platforms like TikTok, a desire for "affordable treats," and a preference for supporting smaller, artisanal businesses over large corporations. As home coffee machines become more popular, chains must offer unique experiences to attract customers. This changing consumer landscape presents a significant challenge for established brands in the competitive coffee market.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK in early September, sparking speculation about a possible reconciliation with his father, King Charles III. Unlike his last visit, the King will be in the country, creating an opportunity for their first in-person meeting since February. Recent signs, including a meeting between their respective communications teams and the conclusion of Harry's security-related court case, suggest a slight easing of tensions. While trust remains a major issue and reconciliation with his brother seems unlikely, this visit is seen as the best chance for a breakthrough between father and son.</p>
