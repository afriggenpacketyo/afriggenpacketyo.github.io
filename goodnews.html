          <p>Overtime CEO Dan Porter suggests that the questions a job candidate asks can reveal their suitability for a role, cautioning against inquiring about benefits with a CEO. Career expert Suzy Welch agrees, advising that such topics are better discussed with HR after an offer is made. Instead, candidates should use their time with senior leaders to discuss market dynamics, competitors, and their potential contributions to the company. Asking specific, insightful questions about company culture, such as what type of person might not succeed there, is recommended over generic queries.</p>

She cites a desire for more nature, a different community feel, and proximity to family as key reasons for her own move. The article notes that the rise of remote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has made it easier for entertainment professionals to live outside of traditional industry hubs. Other notable figures like Jason Priestley, Sylvester Stallone, and Jessica Simpson have also left California, seeking a simpler lifestyle elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A Seattle-area nonprofit called Community Loaves coordinates a network of nearly 900 home bakers to donate fresh, whole-grain bread to local food banks. Started during the pandemic by a former culinary school dean, the organization has provided over 200,000 loaves to pantries across four states. The initiative addresses a critical need, as food banks rarely receive donations of nutritious sandwich bread and are facing increased demand amid cuts to federal food aid. Volunteers purchase their own ingredients and follow standardized recipes, providing a tangible way to support community members facing food insecurity.</p>

          <p>English all-rounder Chris Woakes has retired from international cricket at the age of 36, following his omission from the upcoming Ashes squad. Over a 15-year career, he played in 62 Tests, 122 one-day internationals, and 33 T20 matches. Woakes was a key member of England's victorious 2019 50-over World Cup and 2022 T20 World Cup teams, making him one of only six English players to have won both World Cups and the Ashes. His retirement marks a further departure from the core group that defined English cricket over the past decade.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is uniquely positioned to facilitate the safe and dignified return of nearly one million Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh to Myanmar's Rakhine state. With international aid funding collapsing, the focus must shift from humanitarian support to a permanent political solution. The author contends that China's significant economic and strategic interests in Rakhine, particularly the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port and oil pipelines, give it a strong incentive to ensure regional stability. Therefore, Beijing could lead a commission to oversee a phased repatriation, ensuring the security, rights, and economic reintegration of the Rohingya people.</p>

          <p>The global box office success of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle," which has earned over $600 million, is being hailed as a landmark moment for anime's mainstream acceptance. Zach Aguilar, the English-language voice actor for the protagonist Tanjiro, described the series as a "pop culture phenomenon." The film is the first in a trilogy concluding the popular animated TV series and has topped box office charts in Japan and the U.S. This success reflects the rapid growth of anime as an entertainment sector, fueled by its diverse genres and increased accessibility on streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free access to the U.S. market for sub-Saharan African nations, is set to expire. While the deal boosted exports and created jobs in sectors like textiles, its overall impact has been limited, and trade with the U.S. has declined in recent years. The expiration poses risks for countries like Lesotho and Madagascar but is also seen by some economists as a historic opportunity for Africa to reduce dependency and strengthen its own economic sovereignty. The African Continental Free Trade Area and growing partnerships with China are emerging as alternative pathways for trade.</p>

          <p>Amid plans by the Trump administration to overhaul the H-1B visa program, this article highlights several high-profile tech leaders who once held the visa. Figures such as Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Eric Yuan of Zoom all utilized the program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign talent, early in their careers. While the program faces criticism for potentially displacing U.S. workers, its role in the success stories of these influential immigrant entrepreneurs is undeniable. Many of these leaders have advocated for the program's continuation, while also supporting reforms to address its shortcomings.</p>

          <h2>Pop Culture Expert Explores the Evolution of the American Father Through Sitcoms</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>TV critic Phillip Maciak suggests that the evolution of fatherhood in American pop culture, particularly in sitcoms, helps explain why more young men now aspire to be parents. He traces the archetype from the stoic 1950s provider like Ward Cleaver to the more involved, co-parenting dads of the 1980s like Cliff Huxtable, and later to the complex anti-heroes of prestige TV. Maciak argues that television both reflects and shapes societal views, making the concept of "dad" more malleable for younger generations. This cultural shift is contrasted with a recent rise in a more retro, patriarchal vision of fatherhood.</p>
