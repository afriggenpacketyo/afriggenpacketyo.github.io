        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear cases challenging assault weapons bans and high-capacity magazines, leaving in place laws in several states. Three conservative justices publicly dissented, expressing interest in considering the constitutionality of assault weapons bans, with Justice Thomas stating he would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the AR-15. Justice Kavanaugh indicated he is skeptical of such bans and expects the court to address the issue soon. The Maryland law was enacted following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and gun control groups have praised the court's decision, while gun rights groups plan to continue challenging the bans in other cases. The court's decision comes nearly three years after a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen reports that consumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since early 2020, indicating a shift in spending habits due to economic uncertainty. This trend is observed across all income brackets in the meals and beverages category.

This shift comes as economists and Wall Street analysts assess the future of the U.S. economy following tariff policies that raised recession fears. Optimism score is 70.</p>
