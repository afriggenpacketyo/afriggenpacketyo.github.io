          <p>Semiconductor equipment giant ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net bookings also coming in strong. However, the company's revenue guidance for the third quarter fell short of forecasts, and it warned of significant uncertainty for its 2026 outlook. CEO Christophe Fouquet cited ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical developments as reasons why the company cannot confirm growth for 2026 at this time. The mixed report reflects both the current robust demand for advanced chips and growing concerns about the future economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is ending the deployment for 2,000 of the 4,000 National Guard troops sent to Los Angeles to manage protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The deployment, which was ordered by President Trump against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom, has been a source of significant political and legal conflict. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Newsom both applauded the withdrawal, framing it as a victory for peaceful protest and calling for the remaining troops to be sent home. The move comes amid ongoing legal challenges to the federal government's authority in the matter.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 20th anniversary of Rory McIlroy's historic course-record 61 at Royal Portrush, achieved when he was just 16 years old. Playing partners and spectators from that day in 2005 recall the burgeoning superstar's incredible talent and focus as word spread and the crowd swelled to watch him. The round, which included five consecutive birdies to finish, solidified his status as a prodigy long before he turned professional. The piece contrasts this early triumph with his later career challenges, setting the stage for his return to the course for The Open Championship.</p>

          <p>A stolen Cessna 172 aircraft caused a 39-minute shutdown of airspace at Vancouver International Airport after it was taken from a nearby flight school. The pilot flew the plane to Vancouver and circled the airport at low altitude, forcing air traffic controllers to divert nine incoming flights and instruct a WestJet Boeing 737 to abort its landing. The incident ended safely when the stolen plane landed and was immediately surrounded by police, who arrested the sole occupant. Authorities have not yet released the suspect's identity or a motive for the theft.</p>

The original trial, conducted under martial law, is now being re-examined for fairness, with allegations of torture influencing the verdict. The retrial forces a national re-evaluation of a pivotal and polarizing moment in the country's history, exploring the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>

Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper payments, while critics point to risks such as the potential for the digital currency to "depeg" from its underlying asset.
