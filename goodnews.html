          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has identified cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in international travelers arriving in the U.S., linking it to a significant surge in China. Cases have been reported across multiple states, with health authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan also reporting increases in emergency room visits and hospitalizations. While preliminary data suggests the variant may be more transmissible, it doesn't appear to be better at evading the immune system than other strains. The FDA's vaccine advisors have discussed updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming seasons, considering the potential impact of NB.1.8.1.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, the highest level in over two years, driven partly by surging rice prices. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs, with Governor Kazuo Ueda signaling intentions to raise rates based on price trends. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. The strengthening of the yen and potential government subsidies for electricity and gas bills could also contribute to downward pressure on inflation.</p>

          <p>Prince William has cited Sir David Attenborough as the inspiration behind his new six-part wildlife documentary series, Guardians, which highlights the dangerous work of rangers protecting endangered animals. The prince hopes his series will showcase the wonders of the natural world, much like Attenborough's documentaries have done for decades. Prince William emphasized the risks faced by rangers, with approximately 1,400 rangers having died in the past decade, and stressed the need for greater recognition and support for their efforts. Each episode will feature an on-screen introduction by Prince William, underscoring the importance of the series to him on a personal level.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is resuming horse-drawn funeral carriages at Arlington National Cemetery after suspending the practice in May 2023 due to horse deaths and injuries. Following an investigation, the Army enlisted equestrian expert David O'Connor to improve horse welfare and training. Changes include reducing the number of services per horse, providing more rest time, and using lighter carriages. Soldiers are undergoing intensive training, with a focus on both animal welfare and the solemn duty of honoring fallen service members and their families. The program will resume in June with two squads performing two services a day.</p>

          <p>Dr. Maher Abdallah, director of American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, has vowed to rebuild his clinic after a bomb explosion caused extensive damage. Despite the destruction, the IVF lab remained intact, and thousands of frozen eggs, sperm, and embryos were unharmed.

The clinic, which serves many in the LGBTQ+ community, plans to temporarily relocate and continue providing services, with a commitment to rebuilding on the same site.</p>

          <p>Bridget Brink, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, is considering running for Congress in Michigan's 7th congressional district.

She expressed disagreement with pressuring Ukraine, the victim, rather than Russia, the aggressor. The Lansing-area district is currently represented by Republican Tom Barrett and is considered a tossup. Brink has dedicated 28 years to public service, working under five presidents.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, a painter who accidentally launched a career creating bagel art, children's books, and toys, has died at 87. In the early 1970s, she began painting faces on bagels and selling them, leading to a family business and eventually a publishing deal. She wrote and illustrated "The Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane" in 1976, and designed bagel-themed merchandise. Later, she designed toys, including Sweetie Pops and Baby Check-Up, which sold millions worldwide. Her creative journey began in childhood, drawing on her bedroom walls while confined to bed due to illness.</p>
