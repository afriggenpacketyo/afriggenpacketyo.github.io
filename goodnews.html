          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days. The man, who was rappelling the Seven Teacups waterfalls, was forced off his climbing lines by the strong water hydraulics. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office initiated an extensive search after he was reported missing, eventually locating him with a drone. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being safely reunited with his family, prompting officials to remind the public about the dangers of navigating whitewater rivers.</p>

          <p>Guatemalan authorities successfully secured the release of nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riots began in two separate prisons earlier in the week, as members of the country's largest gangs demanded the return of transferred leaders. This incident followed the release of another 11 guards who were also taken hostage under similar circumstances. The events highlight the ongoing power struggle and violent rivalry between the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs within Guatemala's prison system.</p>

While no specific reason was given for the decision, the official poster for the final event is themed "The Last Dance." The announcement comes amid considerations for redeveloping the event's venue and past criticism regarding the commercialization of Indigenous culture.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, introducing diverse, authentic regional cuisines that go far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Using Singapore as a launchpad, brands are showcasing specific culinary traditions from regions like Hunan and Zhejiang, challenging old stereotypes about Chinese food. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a form of soft power, potentially improving China's global image more effectively than official government efforts. While this trend creates new competition for local businesses, it offers diners a more sophisticated and immersive glimpse into China's vast gastronomic culture.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity. The recordings, made at RCA Records' Hollywood studio, include his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads reflecting his personal turmoil. The article reflects on this period, where Presley was somewhat disconnected from the evolving rock scene he helped create. It also recounts a missed opportunity to co-star with Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," a disappointment that friends believe marked a turning point before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, narrowing the gap with Apple, whose share declined from 56% to 49%. The shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and new designs are creating renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete in this emerging segment. (not investment advice)</p>

The statement came after the Alaska summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin, which did not result in a ceasefire agreement but did pave the way for further talks involving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Starmer emphasized that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support. He also noted that Western allies would continue to tighten sanctions on Russia until its "barbaric assault" ends.</p>
