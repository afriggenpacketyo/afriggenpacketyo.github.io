          <h2>UK Economy Shows Signs of Recovery, Chancellor Says</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves indicated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" following a stronger-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of the year. The growth was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, though analysts cautioned that the positive trend may not persist due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite the promising figures, Reeves acknowledged that many families still face a cost of living crisis, and opposition figures criticized the government's economic policies. Annabel Thomas, chief executive of Nc'nean Whisky Distillery, expressed confidence in the UK's prospects, while John Inglis of Exactaform voiced concerns about the impact of tariffs and taxes on business decisions.</p>

          <p>The New York Times delves into the formula for winning the Eurovision Song Contest, analyzing past winners to identify key trends. The article suggests singing about personal liberation, using English lyrics, and incorporating elements of folk music, but warns against dramatic key changes and overly silly staging. Successful acts often feature elaborate performances with fire or pyrotechnics, but should avoid being perceived as mere novelty acts. The article points out that the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, aims to maintain a neutral, apolitical environment, but the event often reflects underlying political tensions.</p>

          <p>Jos Buttler, the former captain of England's cricket team, will forgo participation in the Indian Premier League (IPL) play-offs to fully commit to England's white-ball series against the West Indies. Buttler is among five England players currently in the IPL who are also named in the England one-day squad. The scheduling conflict arises from the rescheduling of the IPL, with the play-offs now clashing with England's series due to political tensions between India and Pakistan. Buttler will return to England for the first ODI on May 29 after concluding his group stage commitments in India.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following remarks by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who indicated that the U.S. was nearing a nuclear deal with Iran. The anticipation of a potential agreement raised expectations that economic sanctions on Tehran could be lifted, leading to an increase in global oil supply. International benchmark Brent crude futures fell by 3.7%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures declined by nearly 4% as investors reacted to the possibility of increased Iranian oil exports.</p>

          <p>The New York Times explores the inherent political tensions within the Eurovision Song Contest, despite the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) attempts to maintain a neutral, apolitical environment. The article discusses the challenges of balancing artistic expression with political sensitivities, particularly regarding Israel's participation amid ongoing conflict in Gaza and the exclusion of Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine. The EBU's efforts to prevent controversies include a code of conduct for performers and scrutiny of lyrics, outfits, and stage props, but the competition remains a stage for subtle displays of national pride and diplomatic maneuvering.</p>

The lobbying effort follows a legal challenge to Trump's attempt to fire CPB board members, with a federal judge questioning the administration's authority.

          <p>Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located off the coast of Oregon, is anticipated to erupt for the first time in 11 years, potentially stirring up significant activity for marine life. The volcano's eruptions create hydrothermal vents, which are rich in warmth and nutrients, supporting unique ecosystems. While the eruption is not expected to impact humans due to the volcano's depth and distance from shore, scientists anticipate small earthquakes and changes in the chemical composition of the surrounding waters. The Ocean Observatories Initiative is helping researchers monitor these changes and improve underwater volcano forecasting.</p>
