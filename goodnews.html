          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a deal to reset relations after Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Both sides will also work towards a "balanced youth experience" scheme, allowing young people to work, study, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time, and explore the UK's potential participation in the Erasmus+ education program. The article states that the agreement seeks to deepen ties, especially for the younger generation, and address challenges posed by irregular migration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that Beijing may be less inclined to implement aggressive fiscal stimulus measures in the upcoming quarter, as recent macroeconomic data indicates China's economic resilience against US tariff pressures. Investment banks have revised their growth forecasts for China following a 90-day tariff truce with the United States and a supportive policy package from China's central bank. Despite a slight slowdown in April compared to the first quarter, China's industrial output and retail sales exceeded expectations, while exports grew despite the impact of US tariffs. This article suggests that China's economy is holding steady amidst international trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are holding their first summit, signaling a need for renewed cooperation amid global challenges like the war in Ukraine and shifting U.S. alliances. While polls indicate many Britons regret leaving the EU, there is little appetite for reversing the decision, prompting Prime Minister Keir Starmer to pursue a "reset" with the EU. Discussions focus on issues such as fishing rights and youth mobility, while topics like the single market and freedom of movement remain off the table. The article highlights the symbolic importance of the summit and the potential for collaboration on defense, security, and climate policy.</p>

          <p>Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen argues that the United States needs to prioritize open-source AI to avoid ceding control to China.

Andreessen emphasizes the importance of an American or Western open-source large language model to shape the values and messaging embedded in AI.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by ¬£129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit down to ¬£1,720 from the current level of ¬£1,849. The article clarifies that the price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, so total bills will vary based on usage.</p>

          <p>Drinks giant Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker, expects US trade tariffs to cost the company around 150 million US dollars annually and is launching a major cost-cutting plan. The company will be impacted by a 10% tariff on UK and European imports into the US, implemented by President Donald Trump. Diageo believes its current plans will mitigate around half of the impact of these higher costs on its profit and it will work on further measures to offset the impact. This reflects an improving outlook after Diageo previously braced for a 200 million US dollar hit to profits from tariffs.</p>
