          <h2>Venice Architecture Biennale Focuses on Adapting Cities to Extreme Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:19:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale explores how cities can adapt to rising temperatures and extreme weather caused by climate change, which scientists say led to tens of thousands of excess deaths in Europe in recent years. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for a collective, interdisciplinary approach to rethink the built environment, incorporating knowledge from construction, architecture, urban planning, and sciences. The biennale highlights solutions like redesigning urban areas with more trees and permeable surfaces to combat overheating and improve water absorption, while also showcasing cities like Paris, Copenhagen and Rotterdam that are pioneering climate adaptation strategies. The exhibition aims to spur a global construction revolution to make cities more resilient and habitable in the face of climate change.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite US Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plunged over 21%, shipments to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%, with notable growth in exports to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Despite the overall export growth, economists anticipate a potential weakening in trade data in the coming months due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. The surge in exports could be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia, has made a comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Working with country musician James Dupr√© and producer Kyle Lehning, Travis has released two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," and is currently on his "More Life Tour." AI was used to model Travis's voice using stems from his previous recordings, allowing him to continue creating music despite his condition. Travis's wife, Mary, emphasizes that the process was collaborative and creative, with the goal of preserving Travis's unique tone and inflections.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to circumvent U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip will feature significantly reduced memory capacity to meet new technical thresholds set by U.S. regulations, after the original H20 was blocked from sale due to export license requirements. This move represents Nvidia's effort to maintain its presence in China, a critical market, despite increasing restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology imposed by the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may decrease as top trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. Trump noted that tariffs are at their maximum level of 145%, implying a potential reduction, and described the upcoming meeting with China as "very friendly." China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also expressed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. The announcement of these talks has been welcomed as a positive step towards de-escalating the trade war, but analysts caution that lengthy negotiations are likely to follow.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite being the best team in baseball with 25 wins, are facing a challenging National League West division, which includes several strong competitors. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledges the division's strength, stating that no team is likely to dominate. The Dodgers recently experienced a 5-3 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, highlighting the challenges they face within their division. The Dodgers will play a series of games against division rivals in the coming weeks, which will test their ability to maintain their position at the top.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines focus on the US-UK trade deal and the election of a new Pope. The trade agreement, hailed as "historic" by both Sir Keir Starmer and President Trump, aims to reduce tariffs, though some remain in place. The agreement also reportedly includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim the government denies. Additionally, the selection of the new Pope, Leo XIV, is highlighted, with reports focusing on his promise to "build bridges" and his previous criticisms of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with Britain, potentially easing some of his sweeping tariffs and delivering a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products like beef and ethanol. While the 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the deal provides exemptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. annually and excludes Rolls Royce engines from tariffs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Miner Says Tungsten Dependence on China Is Ending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 22:36:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Developed nations are seeking to diversify their tungsten sources after China restricted exports, causing panic in industries reliant on the metal. China, which dominates tungsten mining, added it to its export restriction list amid trade tensions with the US. With US defense contractors needing to cease using Chinese tungsten by 2027, companies are exploring alternative sources, including recovering tungsten from tailings. This shift highlights the growing awareness of supply chain vulnerabilities and the need for diversification.</p>
