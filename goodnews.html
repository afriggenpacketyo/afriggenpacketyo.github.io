          <p>A new legislative proposal from the Trump administration would increase the investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers to 35% from the current 25%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand advanced chip manufacturing within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS Act. The move reflects the administration's strategy of using financial incentives and the threat of tariffs to onshore critical technology supply chains and reduce reliance on Asia. This is part of a broader policy bill that still needs to pass the House. (not investment advice)</p>

Sockwell, who was convicted of killing a former sheriff, is now eligible for a retrial as a result of the ruling, which upholds the principle of a jury of one's peers.</p>
