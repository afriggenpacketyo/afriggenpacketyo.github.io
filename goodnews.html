          <p>The United States government has reversed its policy restricting the export of certain chip design software to China, according to an announcement from the U.S.-based software company Synopsys. The company stated it is now working to restore access for its Chinese clients to the products that were recently restricted. This move follows a period where U.S. officials had required companies to obtain special licenses for such exports. The development is seen as a potential step in a broader trade truce between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets have seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes jumping to $14 billion in the first half of 2025, the strongest performance since 2021. This surge is fueled by several factors, including supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and Chinese companies seeking to raise funds in a more globally connected market. The renewed activity is positioning Hong Kong to potentially reclaim its status as the world's leading destination for initial public offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down a Trump administration policy that suspended the ability of migrants to seek asylum if they crossed the southern border. In the ruling, the judge stated that the president does not have the unilateral authority to override immigration laws passed by Congress and create an alternative system. The decision is a major victory for the ACLU and other immigrant rights organizations that had filed a lawsuit to halt the policy, which they argued was an unprecedented and unlawful ban.</p>
