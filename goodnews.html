          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest is set to take place in Basel, Switzerland, with the theme "Welcome Home," celebrating its Swiss origins. The UK's entry, Remember Monday, will perform their song What The Hell Just Happened. The grand final will be broadcast live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 2, and BBC Sounds, with Graham Norton hosting the TV broadcast. Thirty-seven countries are participating, including the return of Montenegro and the absence of Moldova due to financial constraints, and Israel's participation is mired in controversy due to calls for its ban amid ongoing conflict, while the "big five" nations (UK, Italy, Spain, France, Germany) plus Switzerland are guaranteed spots in the final.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, marked by significant amendments and government revisions to its impact assessment. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP sponsoring the bill, asserts it is stronger and addresses shortcomings in existing laws. The bill has undergone scrutiny and changes, including removing the need for High Court judge approval, instead proposing a panel of experts. The government revised its estimate of assisted deaths in the first year, prompting criticism of the process as "chaotic".</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill. This "bonus" aims to help retirees keep more money and is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The deduction would be available to those 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. While it would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is not as generous as a tax credit. (not investment advice)</p>

While specialist watchmakers experienced sales declines, particularly in Asia-Pacific, overall full-year sales rose 4%. The company acknowledges ongoing global uncertainties requiring agility and discipline, citing headwinds such as gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but believes pricing power could provide a tailwind.

          <p>President Trump's denunciation of "activist judges" echoes a long history of presidents criticizing the judiciary, though his approach is notably vocal. While the Constitution establishes an independent judiciary, presidents and members of Congress have often criticized court decisions they disagree with. The term "judicial activism" has evolved over time, with both Democratic and Republican presidents accusing courts of overstepping their constitutional role. Trump's criticism marks a particularly politicized phase, where judicial rulings are frequently contested and used as political fodder.</p>

It's okay to experience impostor syndrome and narrowing down what you're looking for is important, whether that's shared racial identity, neurotype, or hobbies. Don't be afraid to try new things, like queer bowling or a zine-making night, and ask a queer friend to join you if you're nervous. If you can't find the right network, consider creating your own space, or connect with others online. The journey of finding your people is a process, but know that you will eventually find them.</p>

          <p>MPs in Westminster are considering a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, while Scotland is also reviewing a similar bill. The proposed law in England and Wales, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of six months or less to end their lives under specific conditions. Supporters argue it provides dignity, while opponents express concerns about vulnerable individuals. The Isle of Man and Jersey are also considering similar legislation.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-year-old human skeleton, discovered in India and buried in a cross-legged position, has been moved to a museum six years after its excavation. The skeleton, which had been left in an unprotected shelter due to bureaucratic delays, will be displayed to the public after administrative procedures are completed. The skeleton was transported with care and will be examined by experts before being placed in the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar.</p>
