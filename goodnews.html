          <p>A major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck near the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake's epicenter was located 79 miles east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 19.5 kilometers. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a brief tsunami threat for the area, but it was later lifted. There have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the powerful tremor, which was followed by a series of smaller aftershocks in the remote and seismically active region.</p>

          <p>A House committee has unanimously passed a bipartisan amendment to increase congressional oversight of the U.S. government's efforts to combat human trafficking. The action followed a media investigation revealing that the Trump administration had significantly reduced staff at the State Department's anti-trafficking office and failed to publish a legally mandated annual report on the issue. The new measure requires the State Department to report on the impact of these staff reductions and ensure regular consultation with Congress. The move is being hailed as a rare instance of bipartisan accountability.</p>

          <p>UFC President Dana White has confirmed that an unprecedented UFC event will be held on the South Lawn of the White House, an idea he says originated with President Donald Trump. The event, part of the nation's 250th birthday celebration, will feature fighters walking out from the Oval Office. White, a longtime friend and supporter of Trump, described the opportunity as a once-in-a-lifetime event that highlights the President's desire to open the White House to the American people.

The package delivery giant posted adjusted earnings of $3.83 per share on revenue of $22.24 billion, citing resilience in its network despite global trade volatility. The company noted that higher domestic package volumes contributed to the positive results, though it faced headwinds from the recent elimination of the "de minimis" duty-free shipment exception. FedEx also provided a revenue growth outlook of 4% to 6% for 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Manchester United women's team has qualified for the group stage of the Women's Champions League for the first time in the club's history. They secured their spot with a 3-1 aggregate victory over Norwegian side Brann, highlighted by a hat-trick from Elisabeth Terland. Manager Marc Skinner hailed his players as "history makers" but stressed the need to strengthen the squad to compete against Europe's elite teams. The achievement marks a significant milestone for the team, which was reformed only in 2018, as they now prepare for the main draw alongside fellow English clubs Chelsea and Arsenal.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is implementing new safety measures for ChatGPT to address concerns about the AI chatbot's impact on teenagers, following testimony from parents who blame the technology for contributing to youth mental health crises.
