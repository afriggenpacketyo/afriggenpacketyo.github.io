          <h2>U.S. Announces New Trade Agreement with Japan, Including 15% Reciprocal Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:14:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever" made with the country. The agreement includes reciprocal 15% tariffs on Japanese exports and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion into the United States. Key provisions of the deal involve Japan opening its markets to American products, including cars, trucks, and agricultural goods like rice. This development comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces political pressure following his coalition's loss of majority in the upper house elections, with a favorable deal seen as a potential way to bolster his position.

          <p>Capital One's stock saw an increase following its second-quarter earnings report, as investors showed confidence in the company's long-term strategy involving its recent acquisition of Discover. Although the integration led to complex accounting and a reported GAAP net loss, the company's adjusted earnings per share significantly beat estimates. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the transformative potential of owning a payments network, a rare position shared only by American Express. The company is proceeding with integrating the Discover network, a move expected to generate billions in synergies and strengthen its market position for sustainable future growth.

          <p>England's women's national football team secured a dramatic victory over Italy to advance to the Euro 2025 final. Trailing late in the match, the Lionesses appeared to be heading for a semi-final exit until a 96th-minute equalizer from Michelle Agyemang sent the game into extra time. Chloe Kelly then scored the winning goal, completing a remarkable turnaround that left fans ecstatic. The match, held at the Stade de Geneve, was a tense affair, with England struggling for much of the game before their late-game heroics. The victory keeps their hopes alive of defending their European championship title in the upcoming final.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, is scheduled to travel to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace agreement in the Israel-Hamas conflict. This diplomatic effort comes as indirect negotiations between the two parties are ongoing, with Israel reportedly having proposed a new withdrawal map within Gaza. The U.S., Qatar, and Egypt are mediating the talks, which aim to secure a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees. While challenges remain, particularly over the positioning of Israeli troops during a truce, U.S. officials are cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the White House last week for a private conversation that lasted over an hour. This meeting marks a notable development in the relationship between the two, which was often contentious during Trump's first term, largely due to Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. Recently, however, their dynamic has shifted, with Bezos donating to Trump's inaugural fund and Trump praising Bezos as a "good guy." The meeting comes as Bezos reportedly seeks to capitalize on a falling-out between Trump and Elon Musk, a key competitor in the space industry through his company Blue Origin.</p>

          <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park," have finalized two blockbuster deals with Paramount Global worth nearly $2 billion, ranking them among the richest in television history. The agreements include a five-year, $1.5 billion deal for exclusive global streaming rights on Paramount+, and a separate production deal extension guaranteeing their company at least $250 million annually through 2030 to create 50 new episodes. The tough negotiations were complicated by Paramount's pending sale to Skydance Media, which initially paused the talks over concerns about the high cost but ultimately approved the pacts, recognizing the immense value of the enduringly popular animated series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, known as the "Repayment Assistance Plan" or RAP, was created as part of recent legislation signed by President Trump. Available by July 2026, RAP will be an income-driven option with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of a borrower's adjusted gross income, with higher earners paying a larger share. The plan introduces a minimum monthly payment of $10 and offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP will become one of only two options for new borrowers, alongside a standard fixed-payment plan, fundamentally changing the landscape of federal student loan repayment.</p>
