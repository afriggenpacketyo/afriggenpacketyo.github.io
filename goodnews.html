          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant surge after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020. Musk acquired approximately $1 billion worth of stock, an action widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's future. This move comes as Tesla faces challenges, including slumping sales and mixed analyst ratings, but also pursues ambitious goals in AI and robotics. The purchase is seen by some experts as a strategic doubling-down on the company's long-term vision amid shareholder votes on a new pay package and investment in xAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ruth Weiss, a Jewish journalist, writer, and human rights activist, has passed away in Denmark at the age of 101. Having fled Nazi Germany for South Africa, her experiences with the Holocaust and apartheid fueled a lifelong mission to advocate for tolerance and humanity. Weiss became a renowned reporter, using her platform to expose the injustices of apartheid and support African independence movements, interviewing figures like Nelson Mandela. Remembered as a moral authority and a "connoisseur of Africa," her final work continued to call for peace and reconciliation, including in the Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The horror genre is experiencing a banner year, with films like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners" achieving massive box office success, pushing the genre's domestic earnings past $1 billion for the first time since 2017. Historically profitable due to low budgets, horror films are now also gaining significant critical respect, with some contenders for major awards. This shift is partly attributed to filmmakers with backgrounds in comedy, such as Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, who effectively blend tension and release. The article explores how horror and comedy share a structural DNA, both relying on timing and surprise to evoke strong audience reactions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the U.K. are set to sign a significant agreement to accelerate the development of nuclear power, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to streamline regulatory approvals and unlock private investment for new nuclear projects, including advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool. This initiative is expected to create thousands of jobs and enhance Britain's energy security by providing clean, homegrown power. However, critics like Greenpeace raise concerns about the high costs and potential construction delays associated with nuclear energy compared to other renewable sources.</p>

          <h2>Increasing Number of Renters Use On-Time Rent Payments to Improve Credit Scores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 07:12:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of renters are reporting their monthly rent payments to credit bureaus as a strategy to build or enhance their credit history, according to a new TransUnion survey. This practice has proven particularly beneficial for individuals who are "credit invisible" or have thin credit files, with some seeing an average score increase of 60 points. While younger generations like Gen Z are the most likely to use these services, experts advise caution. Before enrolling, renters should consider potential costs, ensure the service reports to all three major bureaus, and understand the risks if they are unable to make payments on time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China plans to significantly expand its energy storage capabilities, aiming to almost double its current capacity to over 180 gigawatts by 2027 with an investment of approximately $35 billion. The action plan, released by the country's top economic and energy agencies, focuses primarily on lithium-ion battery systems. It also seeks to promote the development of alternative technologies like hydrogen and compressed-air storage. This major push is deemed essential for stabilizing the power grid as China rapidly increases its reliance on renewable energy sources to meet its ambitious carbon-neutrality goals.</p>

          <p>A pioneering program in Flint, Michigan, called Rx Kids, is providing unconditional cash transfers to every pregnant resident, with promising results for maternal and infant well-being. The program gives expectant mothers $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for their baby's first year, aiming to combat the high child poverty rate in the city. Recent studies show the initiative has lowered rates of postpartum depression, stabilized housing for families, and improved infant health outcomes, saving millions in neonatal intensive care costs. This universal, community-wide approach is seen as a model for addressing child poverty and has garnered bipartisan interest.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has launched one of the world's most ambitious conservation projects, aiming to eradicate invasive predator species by 2050 to save its unique native bird populations, such as the flightless kiwi. A key component of this nationwide effort is the mobilization of community volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set traps in local parks and backyards. These "backyard trappers" target animals like possums, rats, and stoats, which were introduced by humans and have driven many native species to extinction. The project highlights a social as well as biological challenge, requiring widespread public participation to protect the country's vulnerable wildlife.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service in the U.K. has dropped all charges against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who were accused of spying for China. The men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, had been charged under the Official Secrets Act but denied the allegations. Prosecutors informed the court that they would offer no evidence, stating that the case did not meet the threshold for a trial, leading to not guilty verdicts. One of the accused described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare," while the Home Office expressed disappointment that the serious allegations would not be tried in court.</p>

          <p>China's top internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, has announced new draft regulations that will require network operators to report "particularly serious" cybersecurity incidents to authorities within one hour. These measures, set to take effect on November 1, establish a four-tiered classification system for incidents. The most severe category includes attacks on the portals of high-level government agencies and key national news websites that cause prolonged disruptions.

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies after ruling the company arbitrarily violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. Gomez argued the platform, where she has over 5 million followers, was essential for her work and that she was given no clear reason for the closure. The court found that Meta applied its nudity policies inconsistently and ordered the company to create clearer mechanisms for users to challenge content moderation decisions. The ruling marks another instance of a South American court holding social media platforms accountable for their policies.</p>

Despite some media reports, the weather system has not been officially named Storm Amy, as the forecast impacts are not considered severe enough to warrant an amber or red warning.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation aimed at banning employers from using credit reports to vet job applicants. The bill seeks to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, arguing that denying employment based on financial history is unfair and makes little sense, as credit history is not a reliable predictor of job performance. Proponents highlight that the practice disproportionately disqualifies people of color and women from job opportunities. The push to end this practice comes as the U.S. labor market faces pressure, and it aims to remove a significant obstacle for many Americans seeking employment.</p>
