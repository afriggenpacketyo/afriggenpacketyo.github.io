        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) designed as a condominium, allowing it to be sold independently from the main property. This development comes a year after the city pioneered legislation to enable such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. Mayor Matt Mahan expressed hope that this initiative will serve as a model for other cities in the state to address the ongoing housing crisis. Amid a statewide boom, ADUs accounted for approximately one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024, with San José doubling its construction permits for these units over the last five years.</p>

The agreement was initiated in the early 2000s by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, as a testament to Gabriel's vitality. Although declining health prevented him from traveling from his Virginia home, Gabriel was determined to fulfill his commitment. He led the band remotely, demonstrating his enduring dedication to his word and his passion for music, stating that keeping his promise was of the utmost importance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from India is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes should avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two recent clinical trials suggest that consuming mangoes in moderation, particularly as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study found that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than bread, while another eight-week trial showed improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance among participants who ate mango for breakfast. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and that this finding is not a license for unlimited consumption.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by depicting late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers-themed basketball jersey instead of his iconic purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger mural celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship on the side of a future Eat Fantastic restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while each restaurant location features a Kobe mural, they wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme, using an iconic, intense image of Bryant but altering the jersey. The creative choice has elicited mixed reactions, sparking conversations about sports loyalty and artistic interpretation in Los Angeles.</p>

Brands from United Airlines to Shake Shack and even government entities quickly adopted orange hues in their marketing to align with the cultural phenomenon. This rapid response underscores the significant economic impact Swift commands, with her Eras Tour previously generating substantial revenue for host cities. The marketing blitz reflects a broader strategy by companies to capitalize on her immense influence and connect with her highly engaged fanbase in real-time.</p>

          <p>During the 80th anniversary commemoration of VJ Day, 104-year-old World War II veteran Captain Yavar Abbas delivered an unscripted, emotional tribute that visibly moved King Charles III and Queen Camilla. While on stage, Capt. Abbas deviated from his prepared remarks to salute the "brave King" for attending the event despite his ongoing cancer treatment. He then shared that he has been cancer-free for 25 years, drawing applause from the audience and tears from the Queen. Capt. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman in the British Indian Army, shared his extraordinary journey and reflections on war, adding a deeply personal moment to the national ceremony.</p>

          <p>Topshop, the once-dominant British fashion brand, is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone stores to the High Street. The move comes years after its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, leading to the closure of all physical locations. To mark its relaunch, Topshop is hosting its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a renewed effort to reclaim its status as a fashion trendsetter. While the brand has been available online through ASOS, industry experts note it faces the dual challenge of attracting a new generation of shoppers while also appealing to the nostalgia of its original millennial and Gen-Z customer base.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a dramatic Premier League opener at Anfield that was filled with emotional tributes and on-field controversies. New £70 million signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact for Liverpool, scoring one goal and assisting another in a standout debut performance. The match also featured poignant tributes to former Liverpool striker Diogo Jota, who tragically passed away in July. However, the game was also marred by an allegation of racist abuse from the crowd. Despite the victory, the article notes that Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, which were apparent in the pre-season, were once again exposed by Bournemouth's attack.</p>

This revival is encouraging a backlog of high-value startups to prepare for public offerings, with Wall Street anticipating a busy second half of the year. The positive trend is also supported by a more stable market and calls from regulators to make the IPO process more attractive for companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is positioning itself to enter the electric vehicle market with a compact, barebones pickup truck priced significantly below the current U.S. average. The company's strategy focuses on manufacturing a simple, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into a five-seat SUV. By keeping the initial vehicle simple, Slate aims to reduce production costs and pass the savings to consumers. The approach has already attracted over 100,000 reservations, tapping into consumer demand for more affordable EV options amid rising prices and changing federal incentives.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between the White House and Washington D.C. officials to limit the Trump administration's recent takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the new pact, control of the MPD will remain with its current chief, Pamela Smith, rather than being transferred to a federal administrator from the DEA. This development follows a lawsuit filed by the D.C. attorney general, who called the federal move a "hostile takeover" and argued it exceeded legal authority under the Home Rule Act. The agreement de-escalates a tense power struggle over local governance and policing in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Scottish jazz pianist Fergus McCreadie initially dismissed calls from director Spike Lee as spam before realizing it was a genuine offer to work on the new film "Highest 2 Lowest."

The 2022 Scottish Album of the Year winner described the experience as surreal, which included Lee flying to Edinburgh to watch him perform live. This unexpected opportunity has opened a new avenue for the acclaimed pianist, who now hopes to pursue more work in film composition.</p>

          <p>All-rounder Jacob Bethell, 21, has been named captain of an understrength England T20 side for its upcoming tour of Ireland, making him the youngest man to lead the country in international cricket. The record was previously held by Monty Bowden, who was 23 when he captained a Test match in 1889. With many senior players being rested, selectors have shown significant faith in Bethell's leadership qualities, which he has previously demonstrated with England's Under-19s. The appointment is a notable honor for the young player, who will lead the team in three T20 matches in Dublin this September, providing him a major opportunity to develop his skills on the international stage.</p>
