          <p>India's women's cricket team clinched a 2-1 series victory over England in a decisive one-day international match. After India set a challenging target of 318 runs, England's chase fell short despite a strong performance from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, who scored 98. A standout bowling performance from India's 21-year-old Kranti Goud, who took six wickets, proved crucial in halting England's momentum. The article notes that England's fielding was ragged and, despite a close final score, India demonstrated superior cricket throughout the match, leaving the English side with much to consider before the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that an extension of the August 12 trade deadline with China is likely. The current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs on Chinese goods is set to expire, but Bessent stated that a new arrangement would probably be worked out during upcoming talks in Stockholm. He described the U.S. trade relationship with China as being in a "very good place," suggesting a move towards a more constructive level of engagement. The talks are also expected to cover other key issues, including China's manufacturing output and its purchase of sanctioned oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's players and substitutes stood arm-in-arm on the touchline before their Euro 2025 semi-final against Italy in a powerful show of solidarity. The gesture was in support of their teammate Jess Carter, who has been the target of online racist abuse throughout the tournament. This action followed the team's recent announcement that they would no longer take the knee, stating the gesture's impact was insufficient and a different approach was needed to combat racism. During the match, fans also applauded in the 16th minute, corresponding to Carter's jersey number, to show their support.</p>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson is set to make his first appearance for the England Test cricket team in eight years for the crucial fourth Test against India. Dawson's recall comes after fellow spinner Shoaib Bashir was ruled out with a finger injury sustained in the previous match. The article contrasts the two players, highlighting the 35-year-old Dawson's extensive first-class experience compared to the much younger Bashir, who was a surprise selection. Dawson's inclusion as an all-rounder is expected to significantly strengthen England's batting lineup as they aim to secure a series victory against India.</p>

          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), a prominent German think tank, has completed a visit to Beijing four years after the organization was sanctioned by China. Mikko Huotari was invited by a leading Chinese think tank, and his trip is being interpreted as a potential signal that Beijing may be easing travel restrictions. Merics researchers have been unable to travel to China since the sanctions were imposed, a point of contention that European officials have repeatedly raised with Beijing. The institute expressed hope for greater future engagement.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for approximately £63.5 million. While the transfer was expected to be completed earlier, negotiations over the structure of add-on payments have caused a slight delay. Gyokeres, who has already agreed to a five-year contract with the Premier League club, is coming off a prolific season where he scored 54 goals in 52 games for the Portuguese champions. The signing is a key move for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who has been keen to add an elite center-forward to his squad.</p>
