        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced Aegaeon, a new computing pooling solution designed to dramatically reduce the number of Nvidia GPUs required for its artificial intelligence models. Beta-tested in Alibaba Cloud’s model marketplace, the system reportedly achieved an 82% reduction in GPU usage, decreasing the need from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models. This innovation, presented at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, aims to address the excessive costs and resource inefficiency associated with serving concurrent large language model workloads. By allowing one GPU to serve multiple models, Aegaeon offers a significant advancement in optimizing cloud computing resources and improving overall operational efficiency in the AI sector, particularly for less frequently used models.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired a significant public outpouring of praise and remembrance for real-life intelligence agents. This article notes a "sudden surge" of visitors to the tomb of Wu Shi, an underground party member who served as a KMT lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949, despite it not being China's grave-sweeping festival. Hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes were left on Wu's tomb, with many visitors calling him an "unsung hero." This cultural phenomenon highlights how popular media can deeply influence public sentiment and historical appreciation for figures involved in sensitive national security roles, fostering a renewed sense of patriotism and national identity among citizens.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is solidifying its position as a leading offshore yuan trading center with the introduction of a new range of measures, including an expanded Renminbi Bond Connect (RBF) scheme. This initiative aims to make borrowing Chinese yuan easier and cheaper for businesses, as Hong Kong dollar interest rates are currently more than double those of mainland yuan loan rates. The scheme will soon be expanded to facilitate direct investments for mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investment, and for foreign firms to gain yuan funding for mainland expansion. This article highlights Hong Kong's strategic efforts to enhance the Chinese currency's international use and strengthen its financial ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing new tariffs: 25% on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, and 10% on imported buses. This protectionist trade policy aims to safeguard U.S. companies from foreign competitors and strongly incentivize domestic manufacturing within the United States. The administration will also offer a credit for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts to assemble vehicles in the U.S., designed to offset tariff liabilities and maintain cost competitiveness for domestic production. This article highlights the administration's strategy to bolster American industry and jobs by discouraging reliance on foreign materials and manufacturing, signaling a continued focus on economic nationalism.

          <p>This article pays tribute to Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, recognizing him as a revered strategist and visionary technocrat instrumental in directing the comprehensive modernization of China's naval forces to world-class standards. International commentators often compared Liu to Alfred Thayer Mahan, the important American naval strategist, for his profound impact. Born in 1916, Liu joined the Red Army at 13 and took part in the Long March before rising through the ranks and being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. His leadership laid the foundation for China's "blue sea strategy," transforming its naval capabilities and global standing.</p>
