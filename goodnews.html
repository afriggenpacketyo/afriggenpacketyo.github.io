The project, which involves six AI-controlled mowers at various national parks, aims to accomplish more work without increasing staff. This test run is a component of the administration's broader "America’s AI Action Plan," which seeks to secure U.S. dominance in AI for economic and national security purposes. The department is also using AI for wildfire response and environmental reviews.</p>

          <p>Struggling carrier Spirit Airlines is making significant progress in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, securing a potential $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing. The airline also reached a deal with a major aircraft lessor for an additional $150 million while planning to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft to cut costs. These financial arrangements, which are subject to court approval, are crucial for the airline's continued operation as it navigates high costs and weak demand. The moves are part of a broader restructuring plan to create a more stable and competitive airline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. government shutdown is expected to have a minimal impact on the majority of mortgage applications, as most are handled by private lenders. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA could experience minor processing delays due to furloughed staff. A more significant issue could arise for homebuyers in flood zones, as a shutdown may disrupt the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, potentially delaying closings. Experts advise that while some hitches are possible, a shutdown is unlikely to be a deal-killer for most prospective homeowners.</p>

          <p>Nike announced a surprising 1% increase in revenue for its fiscal first quarter, defying its own forecast of a mid-single-digit decline. Despite beating Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings, the company's net income dropped 31% compared to the previous year. A key concern for investors is the decline in gross margin, which fell by 3.2 percentage points due to heavy discounting to clear old inventory. The results indicate that while there are positive signs, Nike's efforts to execute a full business turnaround are still a work in progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of the Academy of Magical Arts have voted overwhelmingly to transfer operational control of the historic Magic Castle in Hollywood to its landlord, Randy Pitchford.
