          <p>FICO's CEO, Will Lansing, has responded to criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regarding the cost of its credit scores for mortgages. Lansing argued that the $4.95 price for a mortgage score is a minimal part of the overall $6,000 in closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. This defense comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use rival VantageScore and criticized FICO for its price increases, which Lansing countered by highlighting FICO's dominant market share and superior predictive accuracy.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, financial experts suggest it may be an opportune time for savers to renew maturing certificates of deposit (CDs). Current CD rates remain high, often over 4%, providing a secure way to grow savings before potential future rate cuts. The article advises savers to act before their CDs automatically roll over, potentially into accounts with lower rates, and to shop around for the best available terms. This period of paused rates offers a window to lock in favorable returns for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

This growth was largely driven by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales, particularly the popular iPhone 16 model. While the services and Mac divisions also performed well, sales for the iPad and wearables declined. The company also saw a 4% sales increase in China, reversing a recent downward trend in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated, savers can benefit from high-yield savings or money market accounts, which both offer strong returns. A comparison shows that with current average rates, a high-yield savings account may earn slightly more over time than a money market account due to a marginally higher interest rate. However, the article notes that money market accounts offer features like check-writing capabilities, which might make them more suitable for some savers depending on their financial needs and goals.

          <p>Following a report that Los Angeles has not complied with a 2019 state law, a new motion aims to force the city to analyze its emergency evacuation routes. The law requires local governments to assess the capacity and viability of these routes in disaster scenarios like wildfires and tsunamis. The city's planning department had previously stated it did not publicize the routes due to terrorism concerns, a response the law's author called a "dubious claim." The motion demands a report on routes, bottlenecks, and mitigation strategies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, with 250 remaining to protect federal property. The troops were part of a larger 5,000-member force deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to address protests related to federal immigration policies. The deployment was met with strong opposition from California state and local leaders, who argued it was unnecessary and pulled resources from other critical duties. The withdrawal was praised by local politicians, who are pushing for all remaining troops to be removed.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's parliament have reversed a recently passed law that would have curtailed the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The U-turn came after thousands of young Ukrainians participated in the largest anti-government protests since Russia's full-scale invasion, demanding the government protect the agencies' autonomy. The independence of these bodies is a crucial condition for Ukraine's EU candidacy and for maintaining the trust of Western partners who provide critical financial aid for the country's war effort and economy.</p>
