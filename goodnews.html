          <p>Six more states—West Virginia, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas—have been granted federal waivers to prohibit the use of SNAP benefits for purchasing junk food like soda and candy. The new rules, effective in 2026, bring the total number of states with such restrictions to twelve. Proponents, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., argue the policy will improve public health by encouraging healthier food choices among the 42 million Americans receiving food assistance. However, some medical experts question the move's effectiveness, stating there is no clear evidence that restricting access will combat chronic health conditions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC has officially introduced South Korean forward Son Heung-min, signing him from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported MLS record transfer fee of $26 million. The 33-year-old star is expected to significantly boost LAFC's performance on the field and expand its global brand, particularly within the large Korean community in Los Angeles and across Asia. Son, who remains a world-class attacker, stated his primary goal is to win trophies with the club. His arrival is seen as a major strategic move for both LAFC and the league, building on the foundation set by previous star Carlos Vela.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will be accepted into their first-choice universities this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This trend is attributed to universities seeking financial stability from three-year UK undergraduates amid uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment. The development comes as tuition fees in England and Wales are set to rise for the 2025-26 academic year. Experts suggest that the financial pressures on universities have made them more eager to fill their courses, creating a competitive environment that benefits applicants.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani showcased his dual-threat capabilities with a dominant pitching performance and a home run in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ohtani pitched four innings, allowing only one run and striking out a season-high eight batters, while also hitting his 39th homer of the season. Despite his efforts, the Dodgers' bullpen could not secure the win, giving up four runs in the final five innings, leading to a 5-3 loss. The article highlights the immense challenge of excelling as both a pitcher and a hitter, a feat not consistently achieved since Babe Ruth over a century ago.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is anticipated to cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth reduction since last August and bringing borrowing costs to their lowest point in over two years. This move would likely lower mortgage payments for homeowners on variable rates but would also reduce returns for savers. The decision comes despite UK inflation currently standing at 3.6%, above the Bank's 2% target. However, signs of a cooling labor market, including falling payroll numbers and slower wage growth, may be influencing the expected rate change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Resettling Pompeii's Ruins After Eruption</h2>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the AD 79 Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence suggests a precarious settlement, akin to a camp, existed within the devastated city until the 5th century. Researchers believe these inhabitants, unable to relocate, lived in the upper floors of buried structures and scavenged for valuable materials. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event. It provides a new perspective on the immediate aftermath and long-term human response to one of history's most famous natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down as co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, just before the finalization of the company's acquisition by Skydance Media. His exit was anticipated, as Skydance had already announced its own leadership team to manage Paramount Pictures. Robbins, who has led the studio since 2021, oversaw major franchises like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Mission: Impossible." His departure is part of a broader leadership shakeup under the new ownership, with only CBS chief George Cheeks remaining from the previous executive team, signaling a new era for the historic entertainment company.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has announced plans to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion. The commitment, unveiled at a White House event with CEO Tim Cook, will support the company's domestic supply chain and includes building new data centers and a smart glass production facility in Kentucky. This move is seen as an effort by Apple to avoid steep new tariffs on its products, particularly after President Trump threatened a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors. The announcement highlights the administration's strategy of using tariff threats to encourage domestic manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>
