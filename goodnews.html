          <p>NHS England has announced plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to provide care in a calm environment. The goal is to provide appropriate care more quickly, reducing long waits in A&E and relieving pressure on emergency services. However, some experts have expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and thorough testing of the model.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has stated the bloc's commitment to securing a trade deal with the United States based on "respect" rather than "threats," following US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the US from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting it would create at least 70,000 jobs and boost the U.S. economy by $14 billion. This announcement suggests Trump has approved Nippon Steel's acquisition plan, despite previous concerns over national security risks. Both companies have welcomed the decision, with Nippon Steel emphasizing its commitment to American workers and national security. The deal had been under review by federal agencies after facing opposition from both President Biden and the United Steelworkers union.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations who prioritized company loyalty and long hours, many Japanese in their 20s are choosing to do the bare minimum at work to have more time for personal pursuits. A study found that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to engage in this behavior. This shift is attributed to a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations.</p>
