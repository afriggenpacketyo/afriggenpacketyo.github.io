          <p>During a phone-in appearance at a South Carolina Republican event, former President Donald Trump reiterated his strong endorsement for Senator Lindsey Graham's 2026 re-election bid. Trump praised Graham as a "great guy" who has been a steadfast ally. The continued support comes as Graham faces primary challenges from other Republicans, including Paul Dans, who criticized the senator for what he calls broken promises and clinging to Trump's influence to maintain his seat. This highlights ongoing dynamics within the Republican party ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to peak at 34°C (93°F) in central and southern England. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for five regions, warning of potential travel disruptions and increased strain on health services. The heat is part of a broader European trend, with hot, humid air moving north from the continent. While not expected to break this year's record, the conditions will bring uncomfortable, humid nights, with temperatures possibly remaining above 20°C.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei is expected to announce a new technology aimed at decreasing China's dependence on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial for AI development. The announcement is reportedly scheduled for a financial AI forum in Shanghai. This move represents a significant step in Huawei's efforts to build a self-sufficient AI hardware supply chain, especially as the company remains under U.S. sanctions. Currently, the HBM semiconductor market is dominated by American and South Korean firms like Micron, AMD, Samsung, and SK Hynix.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Media mogul Byron Allen is re-entering the late-night television landscape as his show "Comics Unleashed" is set to take over the 12:30 a.m. slot on CBS. The move comes as the genre faces a crossroads, with high-cost shows like Stephen Colbert's ending due to financial pressures and declining viewership. Allen's model is notably cost-effective for the network, as his company buys the airtime and sells most of the advertising. The show's "evergreen" format, focusing on non-topical humor, is designed for a long shelf life, contrasting with traditional late-night talk shows.</p>

          <p>Television networks and streaming platforms are increasingly producing "making-of" and "inside the episode" companion series for their hit shows to engage fans and drive conversation. This trend, exemplified by programs for "The White Lotus" and "The Last of Us," has become so prominent that such series now dominate the short-form nonfiction Emmy category. These projects serve as both marketing tools and a way to offer viewers behind-the-scenes insights, effectively harnessing fan engagement in a fractured media environment. Creators see it as a way to give fans a direct look into the creative process.</p>

          <p>Despite a severe shortage of child care workers, men make up only a tiny fraction of the early childhood education workforce in the U.S. The field's low pay and perception as "women's work," combined with parental suspicion and liability fears, deter many men from entering. However, some centers are actively recruiting male teachers, recognizing the unique value and different approaches they can bring to child development. Advocates argue that building a stronger pipeline for men could help alleviate the worker shortage, but this requires overcoming cultural biases and improving pay.</p>

          <p>As several Western nations move toward recognizing a Palestinian state, the definition of statehood itself remains a complex issue in international law. The 1933 Montevideo Convention outlines four main criteria: a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity for international relations. However, political recognition by other nations is practically crucial for a state to function on the global stage, access international bodies, and receive protections. UN membership, while a powerful symbol, is not a requirement for statehood and is often blocked by political vetoes in the Security Council.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a major revision of driving laws in England and Wales, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over the age of 70. The proposed changes, part of a new road safety strategy, follow a coroner's report that called the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after several fatal accidents caused by drivers with poor eyesight. Other proposals under consideration include lowering the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and introducing penalty points for not wearing a seatbelt. The government aims to address road fatalities with tougher safety measures.</p>

          <p>Shanghai is set to launch an extensive urban renewal project starting in 2026, focusing on redeveloping "urban villages" and renovating older residential areas. The three-year action plan, announced by city officials, represents a significant shift from large-scale expansion to improving existing infrastructure and housing quality. The initiative aims to upgrade small, thin-walled housing by 2027 and continue the overhaul of old neighborhoods. This ambitious campaign is expected to stimulate consumption and investment by improving living conditions for residents and modernizing the city's urban landscape.</p>

          <p>Everton is reportedly making progress in negotiations to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England international, who joined City for a record £100 million in 2021, has fallen out of favor, making only seven league starts last season. A move to Everton would provide Grealish with an opportunity to rejuvenate his career and secure regular playing time after being left out of key matches and the England squad for the Euros. While an agreement is not yet finalized, the move could see him become a central figure at the club.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a 25-year-old British meteorologist who died in Antarctica in 1959, have been discovered in a melting glacier. Bell fell into a crevasse during a surveying trip, and his body was lost despite rescue attempts. A Polish research team found his bones, along with personal items like a watch and pipe, at the foot of the Ecology Glacier on King George Island. The discovery, made possible by the glacier's movement and melting, has brought a sense of closure to his surviving family, who plan to finally lay him to rest.</p>

          <p>This article explains the key features of sunscreen to help consumers make informed choices for sun protection. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) primarily measures protection against UVB rays, which cause sunburn, with SPF 30 being a recommended satisfactory level. The star rating indicates the level of protection against UVA rays, which are associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal protection, consumers should choose a sunscreen with both a high SPF and a high star rating, and reapply it at least every two hours, regardless of extended wear claims.</p>

The trust structure will allow staff to receive a share of future profits and have a say in the company's governance. The family chose this succession plan to ensure the business's values were maintained rather than selling to a third party.</p>

          <p>A small, fiery object that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified by scientists as a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite. A University of Georgia geologist confirmed its origin after analyzing fragments, determining it is slightly older than Earth itself and likely came from an asteroid breakup 470 million years ago. The event, which caused a loud boom, was witnessed across several states. Scientists say such events are crucial for understanding potential threats from larger space rocks.</p>
