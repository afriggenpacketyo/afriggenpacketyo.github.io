          <p>UK newspapers are leading with various stories, including Rachel Reeves discussing a "better deal" on trade with the EU ahead of an EU-UK summit, and Sir Keir Starmer announcing a youth mobility scheme. Several papers report on a potential U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments following backlash from pensioners, while others focus on the possibility of increased parking fines. The Financial Times reports on the ousting of Novo Nordisk's chief executive after shares in the company, which makes Ozempic, fell significantly. Different newspapers provide varying angles on these key political and economic developments in the UK. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, significantly reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so and the first time including the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, which forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and delayed flights at Midway International Airport. Residents described the event as feeling like debris in the wind and dirt in their eyes, while some compared it to something out of history books. Skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed through. </p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving discarded shoes a second life by collecting them from drop-off locations and either reusing or recycling them. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries where they are resold, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that are not suitable for reuse are crushed and repurposed into materials like flooring, mats, and sandals. The company aims to reduce waste and promote environmental sustainability, hoping to inspire other companies to replicate their efforts. </p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner argued that the government is delivering "more state and more debt" despite voters wanting less state intervention and more freedom. He warned that the government's new fiscal policy, which includes a ‚Ç¨500 billion fund for infrastructure, could backfire economically. Christian D√ºrr was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman. </p>

          <p>Chinese defense scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed the Tianxing-1, a small guided rocket featuring lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins. The Tianxing-1 operates similarly to hypersonic glide missiles but at a slower pace, using a glide phase to autonomously adjust its trajectory to engage targets. This project aims to upgrade affordable, mass-producible rocket artillery for modern military applications. </p>
