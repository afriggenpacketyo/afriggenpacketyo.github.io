          <p>The CDC has updated its childhood immunization schedule, now stating that children without underlying health conditions "may receive" COVID-19 vaccines, moving away from a broad recommendation. This change follows an announcement from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The new guidance emphasizes shared clinical decision-making, allowing healthcare providers and parents to decide based on individual circumstances, while insurance companies are still required to cover the shots for this age group. The agency continues to broadly recommend COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults. The CDC also removed a statement indicating that the guidance was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and backed by outside medical groups.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid on June 1st after Liverpool accepted a fee, reportedly around 10 million euros, to release him early from his contract. The agreement allows the 26-year-old England right-back to participate in the Club World Cup, with his contract including a 1 billion euro buy-out clause. FIFA approved a special window for player registration for the expanded Club World Cup. Shortly after this move was confirmed, Liverpool finalized the signing of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for 35 million euros.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt, as interest rates are currently high, and considering balance transfer credit cards or personal loans. Another strategy is to lock in high-yield savings rates on online savings accounts and certificates of deposit before rates eventually decrease. Improving credit scores can also help individuals qualify for lower interest rates, providing better access to loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has determined that two New York state agencies violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act with their ban on Native American-inspired mascots and logos. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from the Native American Guardians Association (NAGA) after the state agencies allegedly forced the Massapequa School District to retire its mascot. The Department of Education found that the policy was discriminatory because it prohibited Native American-inspired mascots while allowing others that appeared to be derived from other racial or ethnic groups. Proposed resolutions include rescinding the ban, issuing a memorandum to public schools, and issuing apology letters to Indigenous tribes.</p>
