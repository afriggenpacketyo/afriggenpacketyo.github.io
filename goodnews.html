          <h2>Warren Buffett Explains His Investment Philosophy on Productive Assets Over Gold</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He argues that currency-based investments are a bet on government stability and typically lose value over time, while non-productive assets like gold rely solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them in the future without creating any intrinsic value. Buffett states his preference for the third category, productive assets such as farms or businesses, which generate tangible returns and can be valued based on what they produce. This approach emphasizes long-term value creation over speculation on market sentiment or fear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global movement to redesign city streets for cyclists is gaining momentum, making urban areas cleaner, quieter, and more livable. Cities like London, Montreal, and New York are expanding their networks of protected bike lanes, redesigning intersections for safety, and implementing traffic signal changes to prioritize cyclists and pedestrians over cars. This shift is driven by the numerous benefits of cycling, including significant cost savings for individuals, a 75% reduction in carbon emissions for short trips compared to cars, and improved public health outcomes. The rise of e-bikes has further broadened the appeal of cycling, turning it from an extreme sport into a practical and safe mode of transportation for all ages.</p>

          <p>Marissa Coreno, diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer at 27 after finding a lump in her armpit, is sharing her story to encourage young people to be vigilant about their health. Despite having no family history, her diagnosis reflects a rising trend of breast cancer in women under 50, a demographic for whom regular screenings are not standard. After undergoing extensive treatment including chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, Coreno is now cancer-free and navigating life in medically induced menopause. Amid her health battle, she found love and is now married, using her experience to emphasize that life can still be beautiful after a devastating diagnosis.</p>

          <p>The market for trading cards, including sports and Pokémon, is experiencing a significant boom, driving substantial sales for major retailers like Target and Walmart ahead of the holiday season. Strategic trading card sales have surged 103% year-to-date, with Target expecting to surpass $1 billion in annual revenue from this category alone. The trend is fueled by Millennial and Gen Z customers, who are drawn to the cards for nostalgia, as an affordable luxury, and in some cases, as an alternative investment. While Pokémon remains the top performer, sports cards, particularly those for the NFL and WNBA, are also seeing a rapid increase in popularity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 07:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of Americans who have been divorced tend to marry again, suggesting that ending a marriage does not preclude future partnership. The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and nearly half of those who remarry go on to have a child with their new spouse. Remarriage also appears to have significant economic benefits, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being comparable to those in their first marriage and substantially higher than that of divorced, single adults. The overall divorce rate has been declining since the 1980s, with 'gray divorces' among older adults being the main exception.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As millions prepare for another 'No Kings' protest against President Trump, this article analyzes the nature of the 'Resistance' movement, arguing that its earnest and sometimes 'cringe' idealism is a potent tool against the cynicism of authoritarianism. While critics have dismissed the movement's aesthetics as embarrassing and ineffective, its grassroots organizing led to tangible political victories, such as the 2018 midterm 'blue wave.' The essay suggests that in the face of an administration that thrives on nihilism and the erosion of truth, sincere belief in democratic principles and the rule of law becomes a powerful form of opposition. The movement's effectiveness lies in translating this earnest outrage into concrete, community-based political action.</p>
