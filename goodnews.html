          <p>Mexico secured its place in the Gold Cup semifinals by defeating Saudi Arabia 2-0 in a crucial quarterfinal match. Alexis Vega scored the opening goal in the second half, and an own goal by Abdullah Madu later sealed the victory for the defending champions. The win marks Mexico's tenth consecutive advancement to the semifinal stage of the tournament, where they are set to face Honduras. The match was a rematch of their 2022 World Cup group stage game, which Mexico also won, though they were eliminated from that tournament despite the result.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ Pride Month culminated in major parades across U.S. cities like New York and San Francisco, marked by a blend of joyful celebration and defiant protest. This year's events took on a more political tone, responding to efforts by the Trump administration to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender individuals. Organizers adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" to reflect the current climate. The marches also contended with a noticeable decline in corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader corporate retreat from diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, held multiple discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as the two nations work towards a trade deal. Significant differences reportedly remain, particularly concerning the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imported automobiles and auto parts, which were increased to 27.5 percent. Japan is prioritizing the mitigation of these tariffs' impact on its crucial automotive industry. The ongoing talks in Washington highlight the complexities and high stakes involved in resolving the trade dispute between the two allied nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for a voluntary partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers to help tackle rising obesity rates. Under the initiative, food businesses will be encouraged to make healthy options more accessible and appealing through methods like promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulation. The policy, which will be part of a new 10-year plan for the NHS, aims to improve the nation's health without imposing specific sales targets on retailers. Critics note that while welcome, the voluntary nature of the scheme may limit its overall impact on public health.</p>

The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life. The program is supported by cancer charities, who note that melanoma diagnoses are projected to rise in the coming years. The goal is to instill lifelong healthy habits and empower children to take responsibility for their own skin protection.</p>

The government had attempted to ban the march using a controversial "child protection" law, but organizers, supported by the city's mayor, proceeded with the event. The huge turnout, far larger than in previous years, transformed the march into a broader celebration of human rights, with many attendees directly mocking the prime minister.
