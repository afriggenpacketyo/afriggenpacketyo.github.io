        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature suggests that fat cells have a 'metabolic memory' of obesity, making it easier for individuals to regain weight after losing it. Researchers analyzed fat cells in mice and humans, finding that even after weight loss, these cells continue to function abnormally, leading to inflammation and metabolic problems. While the study highlights the biological factors contributing to weight regain, experts emphasize that genetics, environment, psychology, and lifestyle also play crucial roles. Maintaining healthy habits such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and strength training can help counteract the biological predisposition to weight gain.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the etymological journey of the word "pride," tracing its transformation from a negative connotation associated with arrogance and sin to a positive symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment. Originally denoting "inordinate self-esteem," pride was historically linked to the seven deadly sins in Christian theology. However, its meaning gradually shifted towards a sense of self-respect. The LGBTQ+ community adopted "pride" to counter negative stereotypes and assert their identity, influencing the rallying cry "Say it loud, gay is proud." Today, despite occasional debates, "pride" remains a powerful symbol of LGBTQ+ resilience and visibility, particularly in the face of increasing legislative challenges.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over ¬£70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers fell short of required standards. The scandal, which emerged during the cost of living crisis, involved switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place to prevent future unauthorized installations, and the government is reviewing Ofgem to reform the energy market.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has endorsed a report by the London Drugs Commission calling for the decriminalization of cannabis possession for personal use. The report recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and maintaining it as a controlled substance under the Psychoactive Substances Act. The commission argues that current laws are disproportionate, racially biased, and ineffective. While the Metropolitan Police acknowledge that drug policy is a matter for parliament, opponents warn that decriminalization could send the wrong message about the harms of cannabis. The report also suggests improving public health services, enhancing cannabis education, and supporting fair access to medical cannabis.</p>

The case has spurred similar legal challenges against big companies over their responsibility for climate change in various countries, influencing legal arguments and court outcomes worldwide.

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to ban single-use vape pens in June to reduce waste and pollution. The ban applies to both online and retail sales of disposable vapes, regardless of nicotine content. Rechargeable and reusable vape pens will remain legal. The decision comes amid concerns about the environmental impact of disposable vapes, which contribute to plastic pollution and release harmful substances.
