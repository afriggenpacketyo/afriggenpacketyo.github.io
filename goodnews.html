          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed his frustration with Ferrari's team strategy during the Miami Grand Prix, where he finished eighth, but maintained he would not apologize for his competitive drive. Hamilton requested that his teammate Charles Leclerc, who was ahead, yield position to him due to his faster pace, and was critical of the team's delay in making the call. Despite his on-air frustration, Hamilton clarified that he had a discussion with team principal Fred Vasseur immediately after the race to ensure there were no lingering issues. Vasseur acknowledged Hamilton's frustration and affirmed that the team's priority is racing for Ferrari's overall success.</p>
