          <p>Salesforce saw its stock price increase significantly after the company issued an optimistic financial forecast, projecting revenue to exceed $60 billion by 2030. This guidance, which surpasses current analyst expectations, aims to reassure investors concerned about slowing growth and competition from AI-powered coding tools. The company is banking on its Agentforce software to drive this reacceleration, highlighting new features and partnerships with AI developers like Anthropic and OpenAI. The positive outlook comes after a period where the company's stock had underperformed compared to the broader Nasdaq index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite rising flight delays caused by air traffic controller shortages during the government shutdown, aviation experts maintain that flying remains safe. The Federal Aviation Administration is implementing ground delays and spacing out flights as precautionary safety measures to manage the reduced staffing levels. Experts emphasize that pilots have the final authority on flight safety and would not take off if conditions were unsafe. However, concerns remain that a prolonged shutdown could increase stress on unpaid essential personnel like air traffic controllers, potentially impacting their performance and creating long-term safety risks if the situation is not resolved.</p>

          <p>The Oklahoma State Department of Education, under its new superintendent Lindel Fields, is rescinding a controversial mandate that required public schools to place Bibles in classrooms and integrate them into lesson plans. The previous directive, issued by former superintendent Ryan Walters, had prompted lawsuits from civil rights groups and parents. Fields stated that his department has no plans to distribute Bibles or related curricula, viewing the matter as a decision for individual school districts. The department intends to file a motion to dismiss the pending lawsuits, signaling a significant shift from the previous administration's focus on culture-war issues.</p>

          <p>Daniel Rodriguez, a 34-year-old project manager, regularly travels 800 miles between his home in Philadelphia and his job in Atlanta, utilizing a combination of buses, trains, and planes. He began this 'supercommute' after taking a hybrid role that requires his presence in Atlanta several days a week, a decision made to avoid the higher cost of living in that city. His weekly travel costs are around $240, and he uses the 4-to-6-hour transit time productively for work, reading, or studying. Rodriguez views the commute as less stressful than daily driving and believes it forces a more intentional approach to managing his time and relationships.</p>

          <p>As support for Windows 10 ends, Microsoft is introducing new AI features in Windows 11 to encourage upgrades, including an advanced version of its Copilot assistant. This new feature, available to testers, will function as a computer-use agent capable of performing multi-step tasks on locally stored files, such as resizing photos or creating music playlists. The AI will operate in a contained environment, allowing users to monitor its actions and intervene if necessary. This development is part of a broader industry trend where AI models are being designed to interact directly with desktop applications to automate complex user tasks.</p>

          <p>American ski mountaineer Jim Morrison has successfully completed the first-ever ski descent of the treacherous Hornbein Couloir on Mount Everest's North Face. After reaching the 8,849-meter summit, where he scattered the ashes of his late partner Hilaree Nelson, Morrison skied down the steep and dangerous route in just over four hours. The descent through the avalanche-prone 'Supercouloir' is considered extremely difficult and has been fatal in previous attempts. Morrison described the experience as a mix of survival skiing and genuine turns, which included a 200-meter rappel down bare rock in one section, calling it a tribute to Nelson.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that California will begin offering $11 insulin pens through its state-backed pharmaceutical initiative starting January 1. A five-pack of the pens will be available to consumers at a suggested price of $55, aiming to drastically reduce costs for individuals who can pay up to $400 for a single vial without insurance. This move makes California the first state to sell its own brand of generic drugs, part of a broader strategy to lower healthcare expenses for its residents. The initiative follows recently signed legislation capping insulin co-pays at $35 in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiff is proposing a new parking plan that could make it the first city in the UK to charge higher permit fees for SUVs and other large or highly polluting vehicles. The 10-year plan aims to reduce congestion and air pollution by discouraging the use of oversized vehicles and encouraging walking, cycling, or public transport. As part of the changes, the city would be divided into new parking zones, student permit availability would be reduced, and resident permits in the city center would be phased out. The proposal has generated mixed reactions from residents, with some supporting the environmental goals and others concerned about the financial impact.</p>

          <p>The Vatican's Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors has issued a report calling for comprehensive reparations for victims of clergy sexual assault. The panel recommends not only financial compensation to help survivors cover therapy costs but also crucial spiritual and psychological support. The report emphasizes the church's moral obligation to heal these wounds by publicly accepting responsibility, offering apologies, and being transparent about sanctions against abusers. These guidelines stress that listening to and welcoming victims is often as important as financial aid, reflecting a victim-centered approach to addressing the church's historical failings.</p>
