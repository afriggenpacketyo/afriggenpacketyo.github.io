          <p>Walmart is expanding its investment in soccer by partnering with Spain's La Liga, becoming the first presenting partner for the league's "El Clásico" rivalry matches. This multi-year deal aims to capitalize on the sport's growing popularity in the U.S. ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The partnership includes fan events, co-branded merchandise, and retail promotions, with the first major event scheduled for October 24 in Houston.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the monthly cost of a $40,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased, making it a more attractive financing option. Current average rates suggest monthly payments between approximately $379 and $483, depending on the repayment period. This article notes that these costs are lower than earlier in 2025 and last fall, with potential for further reductions if the Fed issues more cuts. Borrowers can also opt for interest-only payments during the draw period, making it even cheaper initially. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black this week presents Europe with a significant challenge, as the last five events have seen home teams dominate. Fast starts in Friday's foursomes are crucial, as they often set the tone for the entire competition. Europe must also manage New York's notoriously boisterous fans, potentially using strategies like virtual reality headsets to simulate crowd noise. The article emphasizes the importance of early momentum to pacify the home crowd and the experienced European team's determination to secure a rare away victory.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) will transition to exclusively electronic payments for its nearly 70 million recipients starting September 30, ending 85 years of paper checks. This modernization effort aims to improve efficiency, security, and save costs, as paper checks are significantly more prone to loss or theft. While most beneficiaries already use direct deposit, the SSA has worked to enroll the remaining paper check recipients into direct deposit or prepaid debit cards. Exceptions will be made for individuals unable to receive electronic payments, particularly the "unbanked" population.</p>

While unlikely for Humberto due to the other system's weaker state, this article explains the potential for a "dance" between storms, which could slightly alter their predicted paths.</p>
