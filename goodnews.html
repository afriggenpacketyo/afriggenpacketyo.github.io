        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread predictions that new tariffs would trigger a rise in consumer prices, U.S. inflation has remained unexpectedly stable. Economists attribute this to several corporate strategies, including pre-ordering inventory to front-run the duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing trade loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these measures have provided a temporary buffer, experts caution that the effects of the tariffs are likely to become more apparent in the coming months, potentially leading to increased inflation later in the year.

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by positive regulatory news, new product introductions, and its recent inclusion in the index. Analysts suggest that diminishing concerns over fee compression and regulatory uncertainty, particularly with the passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, have fueled its growth. The company's close revenue-sharing relationship with the soaring Circle Internet Group (USDC issuer) is also seen as a significant, undervalued asset, suggesting potential for further appreciation.

          <p>The United States and China have finalized an agreement to accelerate the shipment of rare-earth minerals to the U.S., providing a degree of relief amid ongoing trade tensions. The deal addresses China's previous suspension of critical mineral exports, which had severely disrupted global supply chains for industries like automotive, aerospace, and defense. While the agreement marks potential progress, the broader trade conflict remains unresolved, as evidenced by the administration's simultaneous termination of trade talks with Canada, which introduced fresh volatility into the U.S. stock market.

          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their record-high equity face a choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a traditional home equity loan, with both currently offering similar interest rates. However, a HELOC features a variable rate that would decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as anticipated, potentially making it the cheaper option over the summer. A home equity loan provides the stability of a fixed rate, protecting borrowers from potential rate increases if economic conditions change unexpectedly, making the decision dependent on one's risk tolerance.

Despite the lack of local hype, a crowd of over 40,000 is expected, largely due to traveling fans and expatriates. The Lions are heavily favored to win, as the Force finished low in the Super Rugby season and will be missing key players. The match is seen as a crucial opportunity for the Lions to build momentum, with fly-half Finn Russell's performance being a key focus.</p>

          <p>A nearly three-decade-old story about Binti Jua, a female gorilla at the Brookfield Zoo, continues to captivate audiences for her heroic actions. In 1996, after a 3-year-old boy fell 24 feet into her enclosure and was knocked unconscious, Binti Jua gently picked him up and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. Her maternal and protective behavior, which occurred while her own baby was on her back, garnered international praise and stands in stark contrast to the tragic 2016 incident involving the gorilla Harambe. Binti Jua, now 37, still resides at the Brookfield Zoo.</p>

Both account types feature variable rates that are expected to decline with future Federal Reserve rate cuts, so savers might also consider a fixed-rate CD for more predictable returns.

          <p>As many Americans struggle with high levels of debt, understanding which types are eligible for forgiveness or settlement can be crucial. Unsecured debts, such as credit card balances and personal loans, are the most likely candidates for negotiation because they are not backed by collateral, giving creditors an incentive to recover a portion of the amount owed rather than risk a total loss. Medical bills are also frequently negotiable, while other debts like buy now, pay later plans and payday loans can be more challenging to settle due to their structure and the practices of the lenders.

          <p>Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," is reviewed as a purposeful return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work, set against a New York City backdrop. The article describes the album as an exploration of a transitional phase of womanhood, but criticizes it for being overly self-involved, a trait that reflects a broader trend in modern pop music influenced by Lorde herself. While moments of the album are praised for their craftsmanship, the overall production is seen as too safe and its introspection too circular, ultimately diluting the visceral rush it aims to deliver.</p>
