          <p>DoorDash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, a deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. Simultaneously, the company reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations, leading to a 4% drop in shares. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash's adjusted earnings per share exceeded forecasts at 44 cents versus the expected 39 cents. In addition to the SevenRooms acquisition, DoorDash has agreed to a $3.9 billion deal with British food delivery service Deliveroo, both intended to expand the company's services and support its financial goals.</p>

          <p>Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, with a net profit of 412 million euros. Despite this positive performance, the luxury carmaker warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU car imports could negatively impact profitability this year, potentially reducing EBIT and EBITDA margins by 50 basis points. In response to the tariffs, Ferrari had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari. Other European auto giants have reported downturns in quarterly profits due to Trump's trade policies.</p>

The exhibition explores 300 years of Black fashion and the history of Black dandyism, with many attendees interpreting the dress code through daring and memorable looks. Despite concerns about the political landscape and the fashion world's past failures in diversity, the gala served as a celebration of Black creativity and influence.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has pledged to challenge the Labour Party in Westminster when its policies negatively affect Wales, emphasizing her commitment to the Welsh people over party loyalty. In a major speech, Morgan stated she would not remain silent if the UK government makes decisions that harm Welsh communities, using the analogy of the sitcom Gavin and Stacey to illustrate the difference between what is right for Essex and what is right for Barry, Wales. She called for a halt to planned cuts in disability benefits, a rethink of winter fuel allowance reductions, and greater benefits for Wales from offshore wind projects. Morgan also argued that the Barnett formula, which determines Wales' funding, needs to be changed to better reflect the country's needs.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor in the first round of parliamentary voting, falling short of the required majority with only 310 votes out of 630. This unexpected setback has prompted a halt in the parliamentary session to discuss next steps, and triggered losses in the German Dax stock market index. A second vote must occur within 14 days, requiring an absolute majority. Despite this initial failure, analysts still expect Merz to eventually be elected chancellor, though the situation has raised doubts about his ability to fully rely on his coalition parties and pursue his agenda.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs and cuts foreign aid, China is positioning itself as a reliable development ally in Africa, challenging American policies. Chinese diplomats are actively campaigning against U.S. trade policies, framing Trump's tariffs as a threat to developing economies and urging Global South nations to unite against Washington. Experts suggest that Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù agenda has damaged U.S. credibility in Africa, creating more space for China to expand its influence.

          <p>The Supreme Court has been asked to decide a case involving a Maine lawmaker who was censured for criticizing a transgender athlete, raising questions about free speech and voting rights. Republican Laurel Libby was stripped of her ability to vote on the House floor after refusing to apologize for a Facebook post that identified a transgender student. The case hinges on whether the legislature's actions violated Libby's First Amendment rights and the rights of her constituents to representation. The Supreme Court's decision in Bond v. Floyd (1966) suggests that legislators should have wide latitude to express their views, making the Maine legislature's actions potentially unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a significant pullback after a historic surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. It weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar after a 9% rally, with experts attributing the volatility to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. Despite official denials, analysts suggest that exchange rates might be part of U.S.-Taiwan trade conversations, as President Trump has advocated for a weaker dollar to boost U.S. exports.</p>

          <p>Despite trade tensions with the U.S., China has not significantly de-dollarized its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export orientation requires substantial dollar assets, and weakening the yuan is a more likely response to trade tensions than selling U.S. assets. While some market commentaries have speculated about China selling U.S. Treasury-issued assets, the report indicates that China is unlikely to pursue a disruptive sale of its U.S. Treasury holdings.</p>
