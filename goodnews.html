          <p>AI firm Mistral AI has reached a valuation of $14 billion after a Series C funding round led by Dutch chip equipment maker ASML, who invested 1.3 billion euros for an 11% stake. The funding round totaled 1.7 billion euros and included participation from existing investors such as Nvidia, DST Global, and Andreessen Horowitz. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation of 5.8 billion euros from last year, highlighting the continued influx of capital into the rapidly growing AI sector. Mistral, positioned as a European competitor to OpenAI, focuses on building large language models for AI applications, requiring substantial infrastructure investments. The company's growth signifies Europe's increasing role in the competitive global AI landscape.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a succession agreement, positioning Lachlan Murdoch to control the family's media empire, including Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post. This deal resolves years of internal conflict among Rupert Murdoch and his children regarding the future direction of the family-owned media outlets. Under the agreement, Lachlan will oversee a new trust, while siblings Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares in Fox and News Corp in exchange for cash. The resolution ends all litigation related to the family trust, ensuring the continuation of the conservative leaning of the media conglomerate after Rupert's passing. This agreement marks the end of a bitter legal battle over control of the vast media empire.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance on Tuesday, following gains on Wall Street driven by a tech rally, with Japan's Nikkei 225 reversing course after initially hitting a record high. Market analysts suggest the upcoming leadership change in Japan could lead to new fiscal stimulus, creating both near-term volatility and long-term pro-growth opportunities. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite Index experienced a significant drop after President Prabowo Subianto unexpectedly replaced the finance minister, causing the Indonesian rupiah to weaken. Meanwhile, U.S. markets saw the Nasdaq Composite reach a record high, fueled by gains in tech stocks such as Broadcom and Nvidia, as investors anticipate key inflation data releases this week.</p>

          <p>New league tables ranking the performance of NHS trusts in England have been released, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust topping the list. The rankings assess trusts on seven areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and finances, categorizing them into four performance levels, which aims to identify areas needing urgent support. While Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized the goal of ending the "postcode lottery" of care, NHS Providers raised concerns about the metrics used and their potential impact on patient confidence. The government plans to grant top performers greater autonomy and offer support to underperforming trusts, with potential pay incentives for leaders who improve struggling hospitals.</p>

          <p>Multinational companies are increasing their investment allocations to China's new economy sectors, including high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals, according to HSBC co-CEO David Liao Yi-chien. These companies remain optimistic about consumption-related industries like fast-moving consumer goods, reflecting China's position as a key market for driving innovation, consumption, and growth. China ranks as the top target market for companies looking to expand their global trade capabilities, with around 40% planning to increase manufacturing in the country over the next two years. The country's vast market size, industrial facilities, innovation ecosystem, and talent pool continue to attract international investment, with capital markets providing indispensable opportunities.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to unveil its latest iPhone lineup amidst ongoing trade tensions that could potentially increase prices, with the new models expected to be manufactured in China and India. Despite pressure from the Trump administration to shift production to the U.S., analysts predict that such a move would significantly raise iPhone prices. While the company has pledged substantial investments in the U.S., duties on imported iPhones remain, potentially leading to the first price increase in five years. This year's iPhone is expected to offer incremental improvements, with a possible introduction of an ultra-thin "Air" model, as Apple faces questions about its innovation capabilities in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p>

          <p>India has called on BRICS members to address trade imbalances with New Delhi, as the bloc collectively voiced concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted that India's largest trade deficits are with BRICS partners, contrasting with Brazil's accusations of "blackmail" by the U.S. China also criticized "hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism," urging BRICS nations to unite against higher tariffs. Despite these tensions, India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, while China and Russia see it as a geopolitical grouping, as India seeks expeditious solutions to address trade deficits.

          <p>England's World Cup preparations under coach Thomas Tuchel face a critical test against Serbia in Belgrade, with the team's performances lacking inspiration despite flawless qualifying results. The match is expected to be a hostile environment due to a partial stadium closure and warm conditions, with Serbia posing a significant threat. Tuchel's side has secured four wins from four in qualifying, but performances have been drab, devoid of inspiration and lacking a clear identity. With limited time before squad selection, Tuchel aims to use the game as a "proof of concept," seeking to instill his personal stamp on the team and demonstrate progress towards winning the World Cup.</p>
