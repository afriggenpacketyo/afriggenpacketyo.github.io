        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China is driving down producer prices, leading to a potential surge of cheap exports globally, which may cause anxiety in Asia but could ease inflation for consumers. Despite tariffs deterring exports to the U.S., Chinese producer prices have remained deflationary, prompting concerns from other economies about being overwhelmed by inexpensive goods. However, economists suggest this influx of low-cost Chinese products could lower costs for consumers, offering central banks some relief as they balance lowering living costs with trade tensions. Emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate, literary exile, and critic of Nazi rule, remains a cultural icon 150 years after his birth. His literary works reflected his life spent in exile after escaping Germany in the 1930s, with his writings often expressing political views. Mann's Nobel Prize in 1929 was for "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain", but he also delivered radio speeches and wrote essays against the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. He emigrated to the US in 1939 and later returned to Switzerland, where he died in 1955.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, prompted by softening inflation and slower growth amid global uncertainty. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted the Indian economy's strength and stability despite external challenges. The central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% and signaled a shift to a neutral monetary policy stance, indicating limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's proclamation that would ban foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. This order was Trump's latest attempt to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, who make up a quarter of its student body. Harvard filed a legal challenge, calling the ban illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The judge ruled that Harvard demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were to proceed.</p>

          <p>Contrary to fears that AI will automate jobs and cut wages, PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer report finds that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report challenges six common myths about AI's impact, including productivity, wages, job numbers, inequality, skills, and automation. It reveals that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are 56% higher. The study suggests AI can enrich jobs, create broader opportunities, and be beneficial in countries with declining working-age populations. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests that Journalism embodies a forgotten virtue in an era of urgency, highlighting the importance of patience and knowing when to make a move.
