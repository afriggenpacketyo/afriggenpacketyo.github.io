          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has requested that 200 of them be returned to California state command. The troops were federalized by President Trump to respond to immigration-related unrest, but their deployment has left the state's specialized wildfire-fighting unit critically understaffed as fire season intensifies. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization, supports the request, emphasizing the urgent need for these troops to resume their essential firefighting duties to protect the state from active wildfires.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market dynamics by favoring companies with bold, innovative concepts over established corporations. He suggests these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics like stock buybacks, which they view as a sign of stagnation, and are instead drawn to "story-dominated" stocks like Robinhood and Reddit. This shift indicates a market that rewards perceived growth potential and disruptive ideas, moving focus away from macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from UK child health experts suggests that falling childhood vaccination rates are often due to practical obstacles rather than parental fear of vaccines. Difficulties in booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders are preventing many families from keeping their children's immunizations up to date. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles, prompting calls for the NHS to improve access through better app-based booking systems, expanded services, and clearer communication with parents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported that the company has not yet observed substantial price increases for consumers resulting from recent U.S. tariffs on imports. He attributed this stability to proactive strategies, such as forward-buying inventory and the diverse pricing from millions of third-party sellers, which creates a competitive environment that helps keep costs down. Jassy also discussed the transformative impact of generative AI, stating it will make employees' jobs more interesting and predicted that most consumers will have robots in their homes within the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists attribute this to several short-term mitigation strategies employed by businesses, including aggressively pre-ordering inventory to "front-load" imports before the duties took full effect. Additionally, some companies are absorbing initial cost increases to maintain market share, while others use logistical loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay tariff payments, though prices could still rise later.
