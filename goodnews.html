          <h2>United Kingdom Experiences Third Major Heatwave of the Year with Record Temperatures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 04:06:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to reach a high of 34C. The extreme heat has prompted amber health alerts for southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia, and wildfire warnings have been issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The conditions have also led to hosepipe bans affecting over seven million people in several regions due to record-level demand for drinking water. While impacting events like the Wimbledon tennis championships, the heatwave is expected to subside early next week as cooler Atlantic air moves in, bringing temperatures closer to the seasonal average.</p>

          <p>The Welsh national rugby team has ended an 18-match losing streak by defeating Japan 31-22 in a tense match in Kobe. This victory, their first in 644 days, allowed them to level the series at 1-1 and avoid setting a tier one record for successive international defeats. Wales established an early lead with tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams before holding off a determined second-half comeback from Japan. The win provides a significant morale boost for the team under interim head coach Matt Sherratt, concluding his tenure on a positive note before a new permanent coach is appointed.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, home of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand. This innovative move aimed to reimagine the sport, offering a new fan experience with arena amenities and removing environmental factors like wind, which altered gameplay dynamics. Players expressed excitement about the professional atmosphere, feeling it elevated the sport's status and made it more accessible to a wider audience. The event, which featured controlled conditions leading to faster and more powerful rallies, may serve as a blueprint for the future growth of beach volleyball beyond its traditional coastal venues.</p>

          <p>Chelsea faces a significant challenge in the Club World Cup final against a dominant Paris Saint-Germain team, which recently defeated Real Madrid 4-0. Despite being the underdog, Chelsea views the match as an opportunity to validate its youth-focused project rather than a make-or-break moment. The club is pleased with its progress under manager Enzo Maresca, emphasizing a tactical, possession-based style of play they intend to maintain against PSG's high-pressure system. While acknowledging PSG's strength, Chelsea players express confidence in their own abilities and are determined to compete for the title, seeing it as a priceless achievement beyond the tournament's financial rewards.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, part of a larger 2022 agreement for nearly 1,000 tanks. This move underscores Poland's efforts to significantly bolster its military capabilities in response to the war in neighboring Ukraine. The deal also solidifies South Korea's position as a key global arms supplier, particularly for U.S. allies seeking to replenish stockpiles. As Warsaw increases its defense spending to become one of Europe's most capable military powers, it has become South Korea's largest defense customer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, which argued that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race, ethnicity, and location. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims that tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests were occurring. This order temporarily halts stops based solely on factors like skin color or speaking Spanish, marking a significant legal check on the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for a design resembling traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation. In response, Prada held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as an attempt to respectfully engage with the traditional community and address the backlash, while the Chamber is also pursuing a patent for the sandals to protect their cultural heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices without permission to create and sell AI-generated voice clones after hiring them for what they were told were internal or research projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings as training data will proceed. The case represents a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over the use of creative work.</p>
