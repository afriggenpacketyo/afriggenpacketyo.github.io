          <p>Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," a show about a zombie apocalypse caused by a fungus. She argues that engaging with such terrifying fictional scenarios provides a distraction from the real-world anxieties of 2025. Feintzeig finds that immersing herself in a fictional disaster allows her to momentarily escape from the pressures and worries of everyday life. She recounts how horror movies helped her cope with grief after a miscarriage, offering a perspective shift by focusing on someone else's misfortune.</p>

          <p>Thomas Jefferson's Monticello is launching a new tour called "Founding Friends, Founding Foes," which explores the complex relationship between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams to draw parallels with today's polarized political climate. The tour aims to encourage visitors to reflect on the origins of partisan politics and consider how to engage in more civil discourse. Monticello hopes that by examining the founders' disagreements and eventual reconciliation, visitors can find inspiration for bridging divides in their own lives and communities. The tour is part of Monticello's ongoing effort to address difficult historical questions and promote meaningful conversations.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the impact of the "Defund the Police" movement since George Floyd's murder, arguing that it was not a failure despite some setbacks. It highlights the shift in public opinion, increased investments in community safety, and the introduction of radical budget and policy proposals. The authors emphasize that the movement sparked global protests and forced the conversation about community safety into the mainstream. They argue that while fascism is tightening its grip, the movement's power is evident in the efforts to erase its wins and history, urging continued unity and resistance.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe rice prices will decrease under the new farm minister, following the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should be lower than the target pledged by Prime Minister Ishiba. Additionally, a significant percentage of respondents felt that the former farm minister's removal should have occurred sooner. The article highlights the public's concern over rising rice prices and their expectations for the new minister to address the issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment. The pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes enhanced allowances for SDF members, addressing a shortage of recruits. This effort to boost morale comes amid recent scandals that have damaged public trust in the SDF, even as the government seeks to strengthen the nation's defense capabilities. Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to safeguarding Japan's independence and peace in the face of regional challenges.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the first nationalized service departing on time. The government calls the move a "new dawn for rail" and focuses on improving services and investing in infrastructure, although it refrains from promising lower fares. The trains are now the responsibility of the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).
