        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has captured detailed images of ridges on Mars, providing compelling evidence of the planet's watery past. The images reveal a "boxwork pattern" of low ridges believed to have formed from groundwater trickling through rock, leaving behind hardened mineral deposits. These spiderweb-like patterns, previously only seen from orbit, contain small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, a substance not previously found in this part of Mount Sharp. Scientists are intrigued by the unique hardening of these ridges and the reappearance of calcium sulfate, aiming to uncover more about Mars's history and potential for past life as the rover continues its exploration.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Credit Card Grace Periods and Their Importance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 12:51:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card's grace period is the time between the end of a billing cycle and the payment due date during which no interest is charged on new purchases, provided the full statement balance is paid by the due date. This interest-free loan typically lasts 21 to 25 days, allowing users to avoid interest charges by consistently paying their balance in full each month. Carrying a balance from month to month usually results in losing the grace period on new purchases, causing interest to accrue immediately. Utilizing the grace period effectively involves automating payments, tracking billing cycles, avoiding cash advances, and ensuring the card offers a grace period.</p>

          <p>During a bilateral meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte jokingly referred to President Donald Trump as "daddy," prompting a humorous reaction from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The remark came during a discussion about brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, with Trump comparing the countries to fighting children. When asked about the comment at a press conference, Trump responded lightheartedly, while Rubio could be seen laughing. The meeting also addressed NATO members committing to contribute 5% of GDP annually to defense and security obligations by 2035.</p>

          <p>Despite California's looming $12-billion budget deficit, state lawmakers are considering increasing the film tax credit program to $750 million annually. This initiative aims to prevent film productions from relocating to other regions that offer more attractive tax incentives. The proposal more than doubles the current cap of $330 million and fulfills a pledge made by Governor Gavin Newsom to help Hollywood compete with other states and countries. Additionally, a separate Assembly bill proposes increasing the tax credit to 35% for productions in the Los Angeles area and up to 40% for those shot elsewhere in California.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt reaching high levels and interest rates averaging around 22%, finding ways to eliminate interest charges can significantly improve personal finances. Strategies include transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, paying the balance in full each month to utilize the grace period, and using 0% APR intro offers for new purchases. Enrolling in a credit card hardship program or requesting a temporary rate reduction can also provide relief from high interest charges. Choosing the best strategy and committing to a realistic repayment plan are crucial for taking control of credit card debt.</p>
