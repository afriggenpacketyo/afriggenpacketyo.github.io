          <p>JD Property, the unlisted infrastructure investment and asset management platform of JD.com, is reportedly forming a US$1 billion Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in Singapore. The initiative involves collaborations with Swiss investment firm Partners Group and EZA Hill Property, which is backed by Asian investment firm Hillhouse. This planned REIT, potentially listing on the Singapore Exchange as early as next year, marks a significant new entry into the sector, signaling growing confidence and the increasing role of Chinese capital in Southeast Asia. The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets for S$306 million, which are expected to be included in the REIT's asset composition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has urged caution regarding the global surge of interest in stablecoins, advocating for a "multidimensional assessment" of their genuine utility and potential systemic risks. He specifically warned against their excessive use for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and instability within the financial system. Amid regulatory developments in the US and Hong Kong, and discussions about yuan-backed stablecoins, Zhou emphasized vigilance against industry players prioritizing valuations over the profitability and sustainability of stablecoin businesses. His remarks, shared at a closed-door seminar, underscore concerns about the accumulation of systemic risks in the financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump paid tribute to Retired U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Verardo, a catastrophically wounded Afghanistan veteran who passed away at 40 from combat-related complications. Verardo's extraordinary courage and his wife Sarah's unwavering dedication inspired the Independence Fund's Trackchair Initiative, which has provided over 2,000 all-terrain wheelchairs to amputee veterans, restoring their freedom. After enduring 120 surgeries from an IED blast in 2010 and flatlining multiple times, Verardo became a symbol of perseverance, choosing to celebrate his "Alive Day" annually. His profound legacy of sacrifice and resilience will continue to inspire, with Sarah Verardo leading efforts to support military families.</p>

India's markets faced scrutiny upon reopening, with new U.S. tariffs of 25% pushing overall duties to 50% on its exports, raising concerns about economic growth risks. Furthermore, Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings and revenue guidance boosted sentiment for Asian chip stocks, despite a slight dip in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of estimates.

          <p>All NATO member states are now projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, marking a significant collective achievement. This increase is largely attributed to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and persistent calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for European allies to invest more in their own defense. However, a new NATO report indicates that only three members—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently reaching the alliance's newer, higher goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased financial commitment but strongly emphasized the critical need to translate this "cash alone" into genuine military capabilities for effective deterrence against potential adversaries.</p>

          <p>Florida's highly controversial immigration facility in the Everglades, colloquially known as "Alligator Alcatraz," is slated to be emptied of all detainees within the next few days, a state official confirmed via email. This development follows multiple lawsuits against the detention center, with one previously halting the transfer of new detainees to the site. Despite its significant projected cost of $400 million and visits from President Donald Trump and top Homeland Security brass, the facility's operational status as a detention center is now uncertain. Concurrently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration has announced plans for a new immigration detention facility, provocatively named "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue, alongside a forecast for over 50% sales growth this quarter, signaling sustained robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. However, the stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading as its data center revenue, despite a 56% year-over-year increase to $41.1 billion, marginally fell short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. The company's finance chief projects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, underscoring the massive market. Nvidia's growth remains primarily fueled by its GPU-centric data center business, with its board approving an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a considerable delay of over two and a half years, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has finally appointed Steve Kang, the president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison. This fulfills a significant campaign promise to the film industry, which has expressed frustration over the absence of a dedicated point person. Kang, who will be assisted by Dan Halden and producer Amy Goldberg, is tasked with helping filmmakers navigate city bureaucracy. The appointment comes at a critical time as L.A. grapples with a broader slump in film and TV production and the loss of jobs to other regions offering more attractive incentives, aiming to bolster local filming.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its free childcare hours, enabling working parents of children aged nine months to three years in England to access 30 hours a week during term time, with the final phase beginning in September. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply, highlighting the imminent availability of the offer. While average full-time nursery costs have decreased by 22% since 2024, significant concerns remain regarding the availability of qualified staff and sufficient childcare places. Many nurseries argue that government funding rates do not cover their costs, leading to charges for "extras" and some threatening to withdraw from the scheme due to unsustainable financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel swiftly reverted to its original logo after a minimalist redesign ignited right-wing backlash, with critics alleging the change was "woke." This article posits that the controversy stems from deeper American cultural anxieties, arguing that Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate imitation of rural authenticity, rather than a genuine reflection. The chain, established in 1969, capitalized on nostalgia for a vanishing way of life, akin to other corporate giants that homogenized local culture. The author contends the logo itself was not the issue, but rather the company's consistent role in promoting a sanitized, corporate-driven monoculture, now merely updated to a modern-farmhouse aesthetic.</p>

          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under an import tax exemption more than doubled last year, reaching £3 billion, with e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu identified as key drivers. These low-value deliveries now constitute 51% of all small parcels imported into the UK. The significant increase has prompted the UK government to review the current rules, which exempt goods worth £135 or less from customs duties. UK business owners and industry groups are demanding quicker action, arguing that the exemption creates unfair competition for High Street retailers and potentially exposes consumers to unregulated products. The U.S. and EU are also moving to end or modify similar exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like BYD have already surpassed Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024. This juggernaut is fueled by significant government subsidies, tax incentives, lower labor costs, and a robust battery supply chain, enabling China to become the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023. Analysts project China will produce 36 million vehicles annually by 2030, exporting 9 million, solidifying its dominance. This ascent has prompted regulatory scrutiny and duties from Western markets, as smaller manufacturing nations are already feeling intense pressure from Chinese imports. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer attributed Nvidia's slight stock dip to extremely high market expectations and a minor miss in data center revenue, characterizing the quarter as an "anticlimax." He drew parallels to the dot-com bubble, highlighting that while many companies collapsed, resilient players like Amazon eventually saw immense gains, suggesting a similar long-term potential for strong AI contenders.
