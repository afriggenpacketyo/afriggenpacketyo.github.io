          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci and Saint Laurent, experienced a significant increase following reports that Renault's Luca de Meo is set to become the group's new CEO. De Meo, known for his successful turnaround of Renault, is expected to bring his brand management and marketing expertise to the luxury goods sector. Kering has faced challenges with its Gucci brand, leading to a decline in share value, so de Meo's appointment is seen as a strategic move to rejuvenate the brand and improve overall financial performance. Investors are optimistic that de Meo can replicate his success at Renault and revitalize Kering's key brands. Optimism for Kering's future has grown with this new development.</p>

          <p>Israel and Iran have continued their exchange of attacks, with Israel vowing that Tehran will "pay the price" for its latest missile strikes. Despite the ongoing conflict, financial markets initially showed signs of stability, with oil prices slightly retreating and stock indices in Tel Aviv and Europe opening higher. Analysts suggest that the muted market reaction may be due to hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict or a contained, surgical response by Israel. The conflict's potential impact on oil supplies and shipping lanes remains a key concern for investors. Market participants remain vigilant for further developments.</p>

          <p>A documentary titled "Sabbath Queen" follows the journey of Amichai Lau-Lavie, an openly queer rabbi, as he explores his identity and advocates for peace. Lau-Lavie, who comes from a long line of Orthodox rabbis, uses his unique platform to challenge homophobia, racism, and misogyny within Judaism. The film showcases his various initiatives, including Lab/Shul, an experimental Jewish community, and Storahtelling, a ritual theater company. Lau-Lavie emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and compassion, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for empathy towards both Israelis and Palestinians. He hopes to represent a Jewish lineage that prioritizes morality and universal values.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to discuss Cyprus' potential role in the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) during his visit to the country. The IMEC is a trade link via sea and railway that is widely seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative. Modi's visit also carries symbolic weight, seen as a message to Turkey, which has historically supported Pakistan against India.

While Southeast Asia seeks to balance its relationships with both powers, Europe aims to offer a diversified supply chain and access to its defense sector. However, analysts doubt that Europe can overtake the established influence of the U.S. or China in the region, as economic ties are the primary driver of relationships in Southeast Asia. The EU needs to increase its presence and investment in the region to compete effectively. Trade remains the most important factor in Southeast Asian relationships.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing potential rebellion within the Labour Party over plans to cut the benefits bill by ¬£5 billion by 2030. The proposed measures include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a benefit for people with long-term health conditions. Despite concerns from Labour MPs, Starmer insists that the reforms are necessary to address a system that is not working for those who need support or for taxpayers. The government has introduced a transition period for those whose benefits are being withdrawn, but some MPs view this concession as insufficient. The prime minister is determined to press ahead with the changes.</p>

          <p>CEOs of energy giants Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy are closely monitoring the developments between Iran and Israel but are hesitant to make firm predictions on oil prices. Both countries have traded strikes, and the situation remains fluid. The CEOs expressed hope for de-escalation and acknowledged the potential impact on markets, particularly if supplies through the Strait of Hormuz are affected.
