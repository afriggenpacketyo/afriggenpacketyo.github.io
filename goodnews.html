          <p>An NPR correspondent shares a personal travel experience from Antigua, Guatemala, highlighting the local ingenuity of turning trash into art. While visiting a museum, the author discovered a vibrant hanging planter shaped like a bird, ingeniously crafted entirely from a discarded tire. This example of upcycling serves as a powerful reminder of how creativity and resourcefulness can create beauty from waste, illustrating that culture and art can be found in unexpected places.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Licensed psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses the oversimplification and misuse of psychological terms online, which can be harmful despite good intentions. In his book "Psychobabble," he tackles myths such as diagnoses defining a person's identity and the vague concept of "people pleasing," arguing that such labels can be limiting and lack necessary nuance. The article emphasizes that while therapy is a useful tool, it is not a prerequisite for relationships, and true mental wellness involves understanding context, agency, and the limits of self-analysis.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians completed a remarkable comeback, erasing a 10-game deficit in under a month to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the American League Central. Cleveland's 5-2 victory was fueled by a strong pitching performance from Gavin Williams and a shaky outing from Tigers' ace Tarik Skubal, who was involved in several uncharacteristic errors. The Tigers' collapse includes seven consecutive losses, while the Guardians now hold the tiebreaker, positioning them favorably for the final games of the season.</p>

The attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company providing essential check-in and baggage software, forcing airlines to resort to manual processes and causing widespread delays and cancellations. While the arrest is a positive step, the investigation is ongoing, and airports are being advised to prepare for at least another week of manual workarounds.</p>

          <p>Global defense stocks experienced a significant rally after President Donald Trump made a major rhetorical shift, stating that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. This departure from his previous suggestions of territorial concessions boosted investor confidence in the defense industry, with major European firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab seeing their share prices climb. The comments were seen by industry leaders as an encouraging sign that the U.S. is increasingly recognizing the reality of the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have brought back rookie defensive tackle Desmond Watson, signing the 464-pound player to their practice squad. Watson, who was initially cut after failing to meet conditioning requirements in the preseason, is known for being one of the heaviest players in NFL history. Head coach Todd Bowles clarified that Watson's return is based on his potential to contribute to the team's defense in the long term, not just as a specialized counter to a specific play like the Philadelphia Eagles' "tush push."</p>

          <p>Researchers have announced a historic breakthrough in treating Huntington's disease, a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. A new one-time gene therapy, administered via brain surgery, has been shown to slow the disease's clinical progression by an average of 75% in trial patients. The treatment works by silencing the faulty gene that produces a toxic protein, effectively protecting brain cells from dying. This spectacular result offers profound hope to families affected by the inherited disease, potentially giving patients decades of quality life.</p>
