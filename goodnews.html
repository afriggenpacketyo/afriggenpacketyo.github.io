          <p>Japanese stocks, including the Nikkei 225 and Topix, experienced a significant jump following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, driven by investor optimism regarding potential successors. Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae are prominent contenders, with Takaichi's stance on deregulation and opposition to interest rate hikes particularly noted for its potential to stimulate growth. However, the Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields rose, reflecting ongoing concerns about persistent inflation and broader fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of extended political instability for Japan as the new leadership transition progresses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot, based in Shenzhen, has secured around $100 million in a new funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to approximately $280 million. The company simultaneously unveiled Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, envisioning "robotic butlers" becoming a reality within five years. While acknowledging current limitations compared to generative AI, Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian anticipates significant advancements, including ChatGPT 3.5-type capabilities, within the next year. The startup is already generating revenue from sales to schools and hotels, with plans for an initial public offering next year and a goal to reduce consumer robot prices to around $10,000 within three to five years.

This victory not only secured Alcaraz his second Grand Slam of 2025, following the French Open, but also propelled him back to the world No. 1 ranking. The contest marked an unprecedented third consecutive Grand Slam final between the two young stars. Alcaraz attributed his "perfect" performance to aggressive play, particularly with his forehand, and dedicated preparation after a recent loss to Sinner at Wimbledon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes detected by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unveiled the unexpected presence of a solid inner core within Mars. This core measures approximately 600 kilometers in radius, representing about 18% of Mars's total radius, a proportion similar to Earth's inner core. The discovery challenges previous assumptions that Mars had not cooled enough to form a solid inner core, a process that typically requires immense pressure and low temperatures. This finding could also rekindle the long-standing debate about whether Earth was unique in developing plate tectonics, offering new perspectives on planetary geology.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet in Lowestoft, Suffolk, having been entirely unaware of her pregnancy. This rare occurrence, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects approximately one in 2,500 births, where mothers exhibit no discernible symptoms. Robinson had no missed periods or felt fetal movement, attributing existing hip pain to a previous childbirth. The dramatic birth, which happened during a football match, was assisted by family members and an off-duty paramedic. The couple named their son Henry James in memory of a family friend to whom the match was dedicated, adding a poignant layer to the miraculous event.</p>

          <p>This article delves into "living apart together" (LAT) relationships, featuring the story of Margaret and Peter, a couple who have maintained a happy marriage for 15 years despite residing on different continents. Margaret, who moved to London from Australia to pursue a new career after completing her PhD, highlights that consistent and open communication is fundamental to their relationship's success. While acknowledging the disadvantages, such as occasional loneliness for Peter and a lack of constant companionship for herself, both partners find that this arrangement fosters independence and enriches their individual lives. The article notes that while LAT is uncommon for married couples, its adoption by some high-profile figures underscores its potential as a viable model for committed partnerships seeking autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Recreation and Parks Commission has finalized a $1 million acquisition of the historic Griffith Park carousel, with plans to reopen it by its 2026 centennial. This "crown jewel" of the park holds historical significance as the location where Walt Disney was inspired to create Disneyland. The carousel has been inoperative since 2022 following the death of its previous operator and a need for extensive repairs. As one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds, featuring original carvings by Charles Looff, its restoration is a key component of a larger park revitalization project slated for completion before the 2028 Olympic Games, ensuring its legacy continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global investors are increasingly shifting capital away from U.S. equities and towards Asia, motivated by the burgeoning artificial intelligence boom in the region and the anticipation of a more relaxed U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy. According to Bank of America, while U.S. equities dominated investments for a decade, inflows are now more balanced between U.S. and international markets. BofA identifies significant stimulus potential and robust tech competition in Asia, where stock valuations are seen as more favorable compared to the pricier U.S. market. The global AI market is projected to expand fourfold to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with Asia-Pacific poised to capture a substantial $1 trillion of this growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, significant portions of Europe, and Africa were treated to the captivating sight of a "Blood Moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. This celestial event, where the sun, Earth, and moon perfectly align, causes Earth's shadow to envelop its satellite, giving it an eerie, deep red coloration. Astrophysicists explain that this red appearance is a result of sunlight being reflected and scattered through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more readily than longer red ones. While Asia, including India and China, offered the prime viewing locations, observers in Europe and Africa also caught a glimpse of a partial eclipse during the early evening moonrise.</p>

Renowned for his direct communication and fierce dedication to the working class, the poor, and the disabled, Burton played a significant role in mentoring countless political figures, including Nancy Pelosi. Governor Gavin Newsom lauded him as a "towering figure" whose decades of service profoundly shaped California's political landscape. Despite a period where he stepped down to address a cocaine addiction, Burton returned to public life, ultimately chairing the California Democratic Party and establishing a nonprofit to advocate for foster youth, leaving an enduring legacy of championing marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill conveyed a "real sense of disappointment" following his team's 3-1 defeat against Germany in a Group A qualifying match. Despite conceding an early goal to Serge Gnabry, Isaac Price managed to equalize, offering a moment of hope. However, two rapid goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz ultimately secured Germany's much-needed first win in the group. O'Neill criticized his team's "soft defending" for Germany's second goal and disputed the free-kick that led to the third. He acknowledged the squad's limited depth for consecutive away fixtures but expressed optimism about their current second-place standing in Group A, looking ahead to crucial home games against Slovakia and Germany in October.</p>
