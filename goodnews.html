          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people from the city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city since the war, required the closure of significant areas, including the old city, hotels, care homes, and bridges. The Cologne Cathedral was located just outside the evacuation zone, and Deutsche Bahn warned of train diversions and cancellations due to the operation. The bombs, manufactured in the US, were discovered earlier in the week, prompting the large-scale evacuation and defusal efforts. </p>

          <p>An inmate in Wisconsin has admitted to writing letters threatening President Donald Trump in an attempt to frame Ramon Morales-Reyes, a migrant, according to a court filing. The inmate allegedly wanted Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying against him in an upcoming trial. Morales-Reyes, who is allegedly in the United States without legal status, was initially accused by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of writing the threatening letters. The investigation revealed that Morales-Reyes' handwriting did not match the letters, leading to the other inmate's confession. </p>

          <p>A coordinated nationwide crackdown on retail crime, involving over 100 jurisdictions and 30 retailers, resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states. The initiative, led by Illinois' Cook County regional organized crime task force, targeted organized retail crime, where groups of thieves work together to steal goods for profit. Retailers have reported significant increases in shoplifting incidents and associated dollar losses in recent years. The effort aims to deter such conduct through focused prosecution and serious consequences. </p>

          <p>A former Oklahoma City Thunder player reflects on the team's potential dynasty in 2010, highlighting the talent of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka. The current Thunder team, heavily favored to win the NBA finals against the Indiana Pacers, reminds him of that earlier squad. He emphasizes the current team's defensive prowess and the leadership of MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The author expresses confidence that if the original Thunder team had stayed together, they would have won multiple championships, but acknowledges the current team has a chance to achieve similar success. </p>

          <p>Andrey Kurkov's Kyiv mysteries, particularly "The Stolen Heart," explore the surprising ambivalence felt by people living under occupation, using crime fiction tropes to subtly undermine expectations. The protagonist, Samson Kolechko, seeks to maintain order regardless of the ruling ideology, reflecting the moral compromises made during times of upheaval. The novel draws parallels to Mikhail Bulgakov's "The White Guard," highlighting the tension between personal comfort and the barbarism of occupation. Ultimately, Kurkov's work emphasizes the unsustainable nature of neutrality and the eventual need to locate one's moral backbone in the face of oppression. </p>

          <p>Private equity leaders are expressing increased optimism about opportunities in Europe, a shift from the previous year's sentiment. This change is attributed to factors such as falling interest rates, Germany's fiscal package, and increased political stability in France, Germany, and the U.K. Despite lackluster appetite from institutional investors and muted M&A activity, some believe that shifting money into Europe is a sound bet. Asset managers are building headcount in Europe in anticipation of new opportunities, though a wholesale shift in capital from the U.S. has not yet occurred. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Despite persistent inflation, saving money can be achieved through certificates of deposit (CDs), which offer higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs provide a safe investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000, allowing individuals to lock in high rates for the term of the CD. Online banks often provide the most competitive CD rates due to lower overhead costs, while short-term CDs can be a strategic approach in an inverted yield curve environment. It is recommended to compare different banking options and term lengths to maximize savings. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, "And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America," argues for recognizing housing as a human right to address the homelessness crisis. Foscarinis dismantles the myth that homelessness is a personal failure, asserting it is a bipartisan policy failure. She emphasizes the importance of the "Housing First" model and the need for political will to implement effective interventions at scale. Ultimately, Foscarinis contends that acknowledging housing as a fundamental human right is essential for lasting change and effective solutions. </p>
