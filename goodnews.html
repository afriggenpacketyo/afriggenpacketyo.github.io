          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) during a Taiwan visit, calling investment in the company "very smart" amidst ongoing discussions about the U.S. CHIPS Act. Huang revealed TSMC is developing six new products for Nvidia, including its next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin. This comes as the U.S. government explores equity stakes in chipmakers receiving CHIPS Act funding, while China has raised security concerns over Nvidia's H20 chips, impacting their production and sales. Nvidia is actively engaging with Beijing to resolve these issues, asserting the H20 is not a military product. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's electricity consumption reached a historic high in July, surpassing 1 trillion kilowatt-hours, a level comparable to the annual usage of all ASEAN nations combined. This significant 8.6% year-on-year surge was primarily driven by scorching heatwaves across the country, which pushed demand to unprecedented levels across various sectors. The primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, saw the fastest growth in electricity use. This record consumption occurred despite a slight slowdown in industrial output compared to June, underscoring the immense energy demands of China's rapidly growing economy and the impact of climate conditions.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation charge, a decision that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence under the country's strict lese majeste laws. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the evidence and witnesses too weak to support a conviction, noting the prosecution's interview account was incomplete and potentially politically biased. Thaksin, who has faced numerous politically motivated charges since his 2006 ouster, expressed relief, stating he can now work for the country. This verdict comes as his daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, faces her own legal challenges, underscoring the ongoing political instability and judicial influence in Thai politics.</p>

This announcement signals China's intensified push for chip self-sufficiency amidst U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, and Beijing's reported encouragement for domestic AI developers to use local alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs. While Chinese chipmakers like Huawei still lag Nvidia in technological advancement, DeepSeek's model breakthroughs, despite using less advanced chips, underscore the nation's significant progress in building an alternative AI ecosystem. The company will also adjust pricing for its model's API in September.</p>

          <p>After a period of stagnation, the U.S. housing market is showing signs of warming, with existing home sales rising 2% in July and inventory reaching its highest level in five years. This increase in available homes offers buyers more options and negotiation leverage, though prices remain elevated with a national median of $422,400. Mortgage rates have slightly eased in recent weeks, now averaging about 6.6% for a 30-year fixed rate, spurring some refinance activity. While the "lock-in effect" from low pandemic-era rates is easing, experts anticipate rates will remain near current levels through year-end, with potential for further slight dips in 2026.

          <p>Many consumers are discovering that paying the cash price for medical services, such as prenatal genetic tests, can be significantly cheaper than using health insurance, a counterintuitive reality of the U.S. healthcare system. This dynamic became visible after federal rules required hospitals to publish prices online, revealing that for various services, cash prices are often lower than insurer-negotiated rates. The article highlights a woman who saved $400 by paying cash for a Natera prenatal test after initially receiving a $750 bill through insurance, prompting her to question medical bills. Experts attribute this to administrative complexities and market behavior, where cash-paying patients are more likely to shop around.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have implemented new "Guidelines for Regulating Medical Science Self-Media Behaviour" to combat the widespread issue of false and misleading medical information disseminated online. These comprehensive rules specifically target health influencers and independently generated content on social media and other unofficial channels, imposing stricter requirements for healthcare practitioners and related personnel when posting medical science information. The guidelines also underscore the need for platforms to take greater responsibility to verify account credentials and ensure content authenticity. This initiative, alongside new guidelines for recognizing medical advertisements, aims to clearly distinguish genuine public health education from disguised commercial promotion, fostering a more reliable online health environment.</p>

          <p>Europe is enduring a prolonged and severe summer heatwave, driving a nearly 60% surge in demand for Chinese air conditioners in July compared to the previous year.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly scaled back his threat of high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, agreeing to limit them to 15% as part of a new US-EU trade deal. This decision, a substantial reduction from the previously threatened 250% and 100% rates, offers considerable relief to major European exporters like Ireland and Denmark. In return, the EU must pass legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods, including agricultural products, to see the 27.5% tariff on European motor vehicle exports reduced to 15%. The deal aims to provide much-needed predictability and stability in the world's largest trading partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has temporarily halted an earlier order to remove stray dogs from New Delhi's streets, instead directing authorities to catch, sterilize, and immunize them before releasing them back into their communities, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also banned public feeding of strays, mandating civic bodies to set up designated feeding zones and warning of legal action against violators. This decision, prompted by a surge in dog bite cases and 54 suspected human deaths from rabies in 2024, comes after widespread protests from animal rights activists who criticized the earlier removal order as logistically impractical and inhumane, advocating for strict enforcement of animal birth control rules.</p>

A new specialist team, expanding to over 200 investigators, will utilize travel data to identify claimants who are no longer eligible after being outside the UK for more than eight weeks, barring exceptional circumstances. This initiative follows a successful pilot that saved £17 million by stopping incorrect payments to 2,600 people in less than 12 months. The government plans to extend similar scrutiny to other benefits claimed overseas, addressing an estimated £6.5 billion in overall benefit overpayments due to fraud. (not investment advice)</p>
