          <p>The U.S. government has become the largest single shareholder in Intel after converting billions of dollars in grants into an approximately 10% equity stake. This strategic move, driven by the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to revitalize leading-edge microchip manufacturing on American soil and reduce dependency on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC. The investment is framed as a critical national security measure to counter competition from China and mitigate supply chain risks, particularly concerning Taiwan's geopolitical situation. While intended to secure the production of vital components for everything from AI to defense systems, experts note the move carries risks associated with government intervention in corporate affairs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent gathering of Asian powers within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) highlights a shifting global dynamic, but lacks a foundational economic agreement similar to the post-war Bretton Woods system. The author contends that for a new world order to be stable, political declarations must be supported by robust multilateral institutions governing monetary policy, trade, and economic development. The expansion of the SCO, which now includes 27 members and partners like China, Russia, India, and Iran, gives it significant weight. The article suggests that without a concerted effort from both Asian and Western nations to build these new frameworks, the world risks fragmenting further into competing economic blocs.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, making him the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, the 19-year-old's new status underscores the precarious future of the world's oldest continuous monarchy, which adheres to a male-only succession law. With only Hisahito and his father as heirs, the ceremony has reignited a national debate over whether to allow female succession, which would permit the emperor's daughter, Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne. Conservatives, however, are proposing to bring back distant male relatives from defunct royal families to preserve the male lineage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay explores how the author, previously indifferent to sports, became a devoted Buffalo Bills fan through her relationship with her Buffalonian boyfriend. The article portrays the team as the very spirit of Buffalo, a city with a history of economic hardship and a reputation for resilience, much like its football team known for its near-misses at Super Bowl glory. The author describes how the shared experience of rooting for an underdog team fosters a powerful sense of community and positivity, uniting the city through a common identity. This connection transcends geography, as seeing the team's logo becomes a comforting reminder of home and belonging, even from afar.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire by granting him 12% of the company's stock over a decade. The package is contingent on Musk achieving extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The proposal, which requires shareholder approval, is seen as an incentive to retain Musk and ensure his focus remains on transforming Tesla into a leader in AI and robotics. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the package's enormous scale, questioning its impact on corporate governance and whether it represents an appropriate valuation of his leadership.

          <p>Scotland's national football team began its World Cup qualification campaign with a valuable draw against Denmark in Copenhagen, a result that head coach Steve Clarke described with his typical understatement. The performance, built on hard work and defensive solidity from players like Grant Hanley, puts Scotland in a promising position in a competitive group. By taking a point from their main rivals on the road, Scotland has already put pressure on the Danes and created an opportunity to build momentum. This strong start marks a positive departure from previous qualifying campaigns, where early losses often derailed Scotland's hopes of reaching a World Cup for the first time since 1998.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed his legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium, creating one of football's most enduring moments. The article recounts the audacious maneuver, where Higuita cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels over his back. This signature move encapsulated the career of a player known as 'El Loco' (The Madman) for his flamboyant, risk-taking style, which included dribbling far out of his goal and scoring 43 career goals. The piece also delves into Higuita's complex life, from his pioneering role as a "sweeper-keeper" to his imprisonment over involvement in a cartel kidnapping.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the administration from ending the legal protections that allow these individuals to live and work in the U.S. due to unsafe conditions in their home countries. The judge criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision as "arbitrary and capricious," stating that it would force people to return to dangerous situations. This decision provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands whose status was set to expire, though the administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>
