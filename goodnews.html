          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets due to trade concerns. According to the article, overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts attribute this shift to concerns about President Trump's trade policies, which prompted investors to diversify into safe-haven assets like Japanese stocks and bonds. The article suggests that confidence in U.S. assets is being restored as the U.S. softens its trade stance and strikes deals.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law allowing preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers. According to the article, the "active cyberdefense" law requires operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches. The police will initially handle neutralizing attackers' servers, while the Self-Defense Forces will intervene in more sophisticated incidents. A new independent panel will oversee data acquisition and analysis to ensure proper government surveillance and protect personal rights. The goal is to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted for the first time in a year, shrinking 0.2% in the March quarter due to a decline in exports, according to preliminary government data. The article notes that the contraction was larger than economists had expected, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. However, domestic demand showed strength, growing 0.6% and contributing positively to GDP. Experts suggest that while the weak yen provides a competitive advantage, it's overpowered by China's machinery exports. The Bank of Japan is expected to remain on the sidelines until more certainty emerges regarding trade policies.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat from migrating whales, as endangered humpback whales are swimming in the same waters where crabs are caught. According to the article, long lines of rope used to pull up crab cages have entangled too many humpbacks. Fisherman Brand Little is using a high-tech system that involves a remote-controlled pop-up balloon-like device to limit the amount of rope needed. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the season to protect migrating whales.</p>
