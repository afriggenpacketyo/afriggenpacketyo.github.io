          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after applying for 646 jobs over 18 months.

She believes that the use of AI in resume screening programs may have initially hindered her application process. After adjusting her CV to be more ATS-friendly, she began to receive more assessment invitations and ultimately secured a job in London, highlighting the competitive nature of the graduate job market.</p>

          <p>Oil prices declined by 2% following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alleviating concerns about supply disruptions in the Middle East.

The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for oil shipments, remained a tail risk, but the ceasefire announcement eased immediate fears. The International Energy Agency reassured that it had 1.2 billion barrels of emergency stockpiles available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Pledges to Spend 5% of GDP on National Security by 2035</h2>

          <p>The UK government has committed to meeting a new NATO target of spending 5% of GDP on national security by 2035. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. The government argues that measures on energy and tackling smuggling gangs could be classified as security spending. The plan aims to provide flexibility to EU countries while urging NATO allies to increase their defense spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering requiring Google to make changes to its search services to promote greater competition. The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes if a firm holds too much power in a particular market. Potential changes include "choice" screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. Google has stated that the proposed changes could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II. The organization, which now has 32 members, functions as a collective security alliance, offering mutual defense through military and political means if a member state is threatened. Article 5 of the charter, the collective defense clause, states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Russia's war against Ukraine has given NATO a renewed sense of purpose and strategic relevance.</p>

          <p>Global equities showed muted gains as investors processed President Trump's ceasefire announcement between Iran and Israel. Investor sentiment remained relatively subdued, reflecting a market potentially desensitized by America's policymaking. Analysts suggest that the market's muted response is due to fatigue with Trump's policy changes and the largely subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The wild swings from tariff policy changes in April have resulted in subsequent shocks having less impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Western airlines risk greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts as the conflict between Iran and Israel forces most carriers to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies continue to use it, giving them a competitive advantage. The closure of airspace in Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan has led to flight diversions and cancellations, particularly after Iran's missile assault on a U.S. military base in Qatar. Chinese airlines have more flexibility due to Moscow's closure of its airspace to the West after the Russia-Ukraine war started in 2022.</p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years. The island, which includes a ruined castle, working farm, and holiday accommodation business, has been home to the family since 1945. The island's white sand beaches and rocky coves provided an "idyllic" childhood for the family. The castle was built in 1911 by a New Zealand-born adventurer, but fell into ruins in the 1980s due to high upkeep costs.</p>
