          <h2>Retailers Warn of Price Increases Due to US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Several major retailers, including Pandora, Puma, and Hugo Boss, are evaluating their pricing strategies in the United States and globally in response to President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs. These companies, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Asia, anticipate potential price increases across the affordable jewelry and sportswear industries. While some retailers are considering optimizing their supply chains, the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, recession risks, and immigration policy is dampening consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., which is the largest single market for some of these brands.</p>

          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers have been convicted of criminal damage for felling the Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark adjacent to Hadrian‚Äôs Wall in northern England. The tree, which stood for over a century, was illegally cut down in September 2023, causing widespread shock and anger. Prosecutors presented evidence, including video footage and messages, indicating the two men acted together in what they called a "moronic mission." Despite both men denying involvement, the jury found them guilty, and they will be sentenced in July. Sprouts have been spotted near the base of the stump, offering hope for new life.</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley has expressed concern regarding the potential impact of Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson on the coach's legacy. Barkley noted that the widespread criticism following Belichick's interview with "CBS News Sunday Morning," where Hudson shut down a question about their meeting, is overshadowing his accomplishments. Barkley emphasized Belichick's status as the greatest coach ever and voiced his disappointment that the current focus is on personal matters rather than his historic 24-season run with the New England Patriots. Barkley and Belichick have been friends since before the coach's run with the Patriots.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on specific goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While President Trump's blanket tariffs still apply to most UK goods entering the US, the deal cuts import taxes on cars to 10% for a limited quantity and scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The agreement also includes tariff-free exports of Rolls-Royce engines and plane parts from the UK to the US. This narrow agreement is expected to be followed by months of negotiations and legal paperwork, with some uncertainty remaining regarding pharmaceuticals and digital services tax.</p>

          <p>The White House is considering policies to boost America's low birth rate, including a baby bonus, but experts argue that such bonuses have mixed results in increasing birth rates. Policies that invest in mothers more consistently incentivize births, such as paid parental leave and expanded public child care. A one-time bonus would not address the systemic neglect of child care, maternity leave, and child poverty. While a baby bonus may be a good idea, a renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a more effective first step in investing in mothers and promoting the well-being of American children.</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist argues against the simple idea of instinct, stating that the term is confusing and unhelpful. He uses the phrase ‚Äúspecies-typical‚Äù behavior instead. He says it's a behavior that is typical to a species, but it doesn‚Äôt presume anything about where it came from or what‚Äôs controlling it or whether learning is involved or whether genes are involved. He explains that habitual behaviors are not just rooted in the mind, but also shaped by the environment, learning, and physical abilities. By examining the behaviors of animals, we can learn a lot about the complexities of our own actions, especially since humans are animals.</p>
