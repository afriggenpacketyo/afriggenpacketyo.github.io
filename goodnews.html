          <p>The Trump administration has extended a pause on tariff hikes against Chinese goods for an additional 90 days, maintaining the current 30% rate and averting a potential escalation. The executive order prevents levies from jumping to much higher levels, providing more time for negotiators from both nations to work towards a longer-term trade agreement. This move signals a continued effort to de-escalate the trade war that has previously seen sharp, retaliatory tariffs between the world's two largest economies. Officials have expressed cautious optimism that a resolution can be reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a motion from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy previously convicted by a jury for using excessive force. The judge ruled that overturning the conviction was "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy to begin his four-month prison sentence. This case gained notoriety after the new U.S. Attorney, a Trump appointee, sought to unravel the prosecution, prompting resignations within the office. The ruling upholds the jury's verdict despite unusual post-conviction pressure from prosecutors to nullify it.</p>

          <p>In an unconventional arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses, allowing them to sell specific advanced chips to the Chinese market after previous restrictions. President Trump described the deal as a negotiation that benefits the country, turning export controls into a direct revenue stream for the U.S. Treasury. The move is a novel approach to managing national security concerns and economic competition in the critical AI technology sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The initiative will involve school police, staff, and community volunteers creating protective perimeters before and after school. This public commitment aims to reassure families that schools are safe environments and that officials will work to protect them on their way to and from campuses.</p>

          <p>In Mexico City's Xochimilco borough, scientists are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl, a unique salamander now rarely seen in the wild. By filtering water from the canals, researchers can detect genetic traces of the elusive creature, a necessary technique as traditional net surveys often come up empty. While initial eDNA samples have confirmed the axolotl's presence in protected refuge areas, their numbers outside these zones are perilously low. The research highlights the urgent need for habitat restoration and policy changes to protect the species from extinction.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Describes Trump's Chip Deal with Nvidia and AMD as a Form of Tariff</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented that the agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their China sales revenue is not a novel concept. He argued that the move is essentially another form of a tariff, with the revenue going directly to the U.S. Treasury rather than being a personal payment to the president. While acknowledging a debatable "pay-to-play" element, Cramer suggested the policy is a relatively benign form of government intervention compared to past bailouts. He concluded that the deal is beneficial for both taxpayers and the chipmakers involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Is Crime in Washington D.C. 'Out of Control' as Trump Claims?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 18:23:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has justified a federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police by claiming crime is "out of control," but official data contradicts this narrative. According to the city's police department, violent crime in D.C. hit a 30-year low in 2024 and continues to fall in 2025. While the homicide rate did spike in 2023, it was not the highest ever recorded and has since declined significantly. This downward trend is consistent with patterns seen in other large U.S. cities. The president's claims appear to rely on selective and outdated figures to declare a public safety emergency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting at the White House, just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The initial call for resignation came after Senator Tom Cotton raised questions about Tan's ties to China. Following a "candid and constructive discussion" with Trump and cabinet members, the president's tone changed dramatically. This flip-flop occurs as the administration takes an increasingly active role in the semiconductor industry, highlighted by a recent deal with Nvidia and AMD regarding their sales to China.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, though it is a less exclusive arrangement than their previous 2020 pact. The new "first-look" deal gives Netflix the first option on their film and television projects but does not cover overhead costs like their prior overall deal did. The couple has produced several successful documentary and reality series for the streamer, including "Harry & Meghan" and "With Love, Meghan." The renewed partnership will also include projects related to Meghan's new lifestyle brand, As ever.</p>

His performance, which earned him player of the match, was praised by his captain and cricket legend James Anderson. Baker's emergence is a significant positive for the Originals and highlights his potential as a rising star in English cricket.</p>
