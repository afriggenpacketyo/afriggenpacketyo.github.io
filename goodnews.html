        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Bull, a TV presenter and former medical doctor, has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf. Bull's appointment signals a shift towards a more media-savvy leadership style for the party, contrasting with Yusuf's focus on behind-the-scenes professionalization. Nigel Farage, the party leader, emphasized that Bull's role would be to inspire activists and provide leadership. Bull, who previously served as a Brexit Party MEP, has stepped down from his TalkTV role to take on this new position, while Yusuf will lead the "Doge team" focused on cutting wasteful spending. The party reshuffle comes after Yusuf's resignation following a clash over comments regarding a burka ban, and Reform UK is splitting Yusuf's role into multiple posts including a new head of operations and head of treasury. The party hopes to gain more traction with Bull at the helm.</p>

          <p>A flight passenger stood their ground and refused to switch seats with another passenger who wanted to sit next to their spouse, igniting a discussion about seat-swapping etiquette. The incident, shared on Reddit, involved a passenger who had paid for a window seat in business class and declined to move to an aisle seat to accommodate the other passenger. The post generated numerous reactions, with many users expressing support for the passenger who refused to switch. Etiquette experts emphasize that passengers are not obligated to switch seats and should not expect others to accommodate their requests.

          <p>Experts are outlining debt relief options for Americans struggling with unpaid medical bills, with millions owing significant amounts. Credit counseling, debt settlement, and debt management plans are potential strategies to tackle medical debt. Credit counselors can help create budgets and prioritize payments, while debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to reduce the owed amount. Negotiating with healthcare providers, exploring financial assistance programs, and double-checking bills for errors are also recommended. Experts advise against using credit cards or loans to pay off medical debt due to high interest rates and potential negative impacts on credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

The estimated travel time between London and Frankfurt will be approximately five hours, while the journey to Geneva will take around five hours and 20 minutes.

          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally expressed concerns to UEFA regarding Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. The concern stems from UEFA's regulations on multi-club ownership, as John Textor, who owns a significant stake in Crystal Palace, also holds a majority stake in Lyon, which has also qualified for the Europa League. UEFA rules prevent any individual or legal entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs participating in the same European tournament to avoid collusion. Forest, having finished seventh in the Premier League, could benefit if Palace is deemed ineligible for European competition. The situation will be closely monitored.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has defended the Labour government's partial U-turn on winter fuel payments, after Chancellor Rachel Reeves initially cut the payment from millions of pensioners. Miliband said that the original decision was necessary to stabilize the economy, but that the government had since created "room for maneuver" to extend the payment to more pensioners. He said the change would cost "a relatively small amount of money" and would be accounted for in the Budget. The Conservative shadow chancellor criticized the move, saying Labour had already spent the savings from the original cut, and that the chancellor did not know how she would pay for the U-turn.
