          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child while installing pipes. The mummy, aged between 10 and 15, was found at a depth of 20 inches, along with ceramic objects belonging to the pre-Inca Chancay culture. The discovery highlights the rich archaeological history of the region, as utility companies in Peru must hire archaeologists during drilling due to the high probability of finding heritage sites. Lima is home to over 500 archaeological sites, making such finds relatively common. </p>
