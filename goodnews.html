          <p>Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado discussed his new book, "The Great Museum of the Sea," which chronicles his 50-year career investigating over 100 shipwrecks. Delgado, who discovered the last known U.S. slave ship, the Clotilda, describes the sea as the world's largest museum, with each wreck telling a unique story of bravery, tragedy, or exploration. He recounted his experience exploring the Titanic in a submersible, describing the vessel as a powerful and eerie stage for human drama. The book aims to share the profound stories and varied meanings these underwater sites hold.</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence, marking five decades of significant progress in development, particularly in education and healthcare. Since 1975, the country has dramatically reduced illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and vastly improved its healthcare system, resulting in one of the highest life expectancies in Africa. Despite these successes, Cape Verde still faces challenges, including youth unemployment and migration, with about 6% of its young population leaving between 2009 and 2021. The nation is now considered one of the most stable and developed in Africa.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is launching a project to combat the New World Screwworm by releasing millions of sterile flies over Texas and Mexico. These irradiated male flies will mate with wild females, producing unfertilized eggs and causing the population of the flesh-eating pest to decline. The screwworm larvae burrow into the open wounds of warm-blooded animals, including livestock and humans, which can be fatal. This sterile insect technique was successfully used to nearly eradicate the pest in the U.S. decades ago but is being revived due to a recent outbreak.</p>

          <p>A striking photograph captures a rare atmospheric phenomenon known as a "red sprite," which appeared high above a thunderstorm over Mexico. These large-scale electrical discharges occur far above storm clouds, in the upper atmosphere, and are notoriously difficult to observe from the ground. The image, likely taken from the International Space Station, shows the jellyfish-like structure of the transient luminous event. This photo offers a spectacular view of one of Earth's more elusive and beautiful weather-related phenomena.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton concluded his second-round Wimbledon match against Rinky Hijikata in just 70 seconds, a day after it was controversially suspended due to fading light. Shelton was serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set when play was halted, prompting frustration from the player and jeers from the crowd. Returning to the court on Friday, he quickly fired three aces and an unreturnable serve to seal the victory. Shelton, who found humor in the situation afterward, will now face Marton Fucsovics in the third round.</p>

          <p>Despite Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys to prevent addiction among children, analysts believe industry leader Pop Mart will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic is young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas revenue, which is projected to soon account for over half of its sales, provides a cushion against domestic regulatory pressures. While the company faces challenges like scalping and production delays, its strong brand and international expansion are expected to sustain its growth.</p>

          <p>An international security expert has suggested that the U.S. could learn from China's model of creating integrated university-industry clusters in second-tier cities to revitalize its own rust-belt regions. Citing the example of Wuhan's "Optics Valley," the analyst noted how these hubs focus on advanced manufacturing and are not limited to top-tier cities like Silicon Valley. This idea of U.S.-China collaboration on industrial reinvigoration comes during a period of de-escalated trade tensions. The proposal highlights a potential avenue for stabilizing superpower relations through shared economic development strategies.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Archaeologists analyzed thousands of bone fragments and tools, concluding that the ancient humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutritious marrow and fat. This process, likely done to avoid protein poisoning from a lean meat diet, suggests Neanderthals possessed sophisticated planning, organization, and survival skills. The finding adds to a growing body of evidence challenging the outdated stereotype of Neanderthals as unintelligent, showing they had a refined understanding of nutrition and resource management.</p>
