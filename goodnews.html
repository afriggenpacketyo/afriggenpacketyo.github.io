          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its national carbon market to include major polluting industries by 2027, a move three years ahead of its original schedule. New guidelines from top policymakers also introduce absolute limits on emissions, representing a tougher standard compared to the current intensity-based caps. This initiative highlights China's commitment to achieving its climate targets and is anticipated to invigorate the country's carbon market. The article notes that the steel, aluminum, and cement sectors will be the first new additions this year, aiming to address China's status as the world's largest carbon polluter stemming from its rapid economic development.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for Tuesday night, following two previous scrubs due to an oxygen leak and adverse weather. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades after three catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is crucial for accelerating launch cadences and testing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a requirement for NASA's planned moon landing by 2027 and future Mars missions. Despite challenges and skepticism from some experts regarding the ambitious timeline, SpaceX founder Elon Musk remains confident in achieving these goals, emphasizing the importance of full reusability and propellant transfer for space exploration.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant shift in policy, stating the US would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, more than double the current number. This announcement came shortly after the Chinese embassy in the US advised students to be cautious when choosing Houston, citing reports of some being "unjustifiably questioned and harassed" at customs. Trump emphasized his administration's intention to "get along good" with China and reiterated an invitation from President Xi Jinping to visit China. The article highlights this as a potentially positive development for US-China relations, aiming to foster greater educational exchange and cooperation, despite recent tensions.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, known as weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound, are poised to significantly reshape the global economy, with the industry potentially reaching upwards of $100 billion by 2030. These medications, initially for diabetes and obesity, are showing potential for treating other conditions and addictions, sparking new drug innovation and job creation. Goldman Sachs estimates GLP-1s could boost US GDP by 0.4% via increased productivity and healthcare savings, assuming a baseline adoption of 30 million users. The article notes a Cornell study found GLP-1 users cut grocery spending by over 5%, impacting food and beverage industries, and raising concerns about exacerbating socioeconomic divisions due to drug accessibility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists claim a significant breakthrough in invisibility technology for Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft, making their signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. Traditionally, AEW&C aircraft are vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions, which make them visible from hundreds of kilometers away. The new method, based on frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, rendering the signal chaotic and obscuring its directional origin from adversaries. This innovation is described as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the stealth and survivability of these critical command nodes in military operations.</p>
