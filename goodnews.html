          <p>Markets across the Middle East mostly closed higher on Sunday despite the United States entering the conflict between Israel and Iran by striking three Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, fueled by expectations that Washington's involvement would help end the conflict. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decrease, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher, as Gulf countries have called for appeasement and supported a peaceful resolution to isolate themselves from any significant short-term market impact.

          <p>Reem Raouda, a parenting expert, suggests using specific phrases to encourage children's cooperation rather than resorting to threats or bribes. Instead of saying "Because I said so," explain the reasoning behind decisions to foster respect. Replace threats with phrases that give children agency over their behavior, like "When you're ready to do [X], we can do [Y]." Validating a child's emotions and inviting problem-solving can also lead to better cooperation and emotional resilience. The key is to create an environment where children feel respected, safe, and involved.</p>

          <p>Despite facing challenges such as tariffs, ongoing inflation, labor shortages, and higher financing costs, small business owners in the US remain relatively optimistic. Multiple surveys indicate that while optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth, many small businesses report business growth and have maintained or grown their workforce. The top concerns of small business owners have shifted from inflation to taxation, and uncertainty remains. However, most small business owners report their businesses as currently successful and see growth in the past year, maintaining employment levels and reporting average financial results.

The LDP's setback in the election could erode Ishiba's authority and influence the national political landscape.

Schmidt's remarks about the Lions' "southern hemisphere centre partnership" and Nucifora's response highlight the psychological sparring that is part of Lions tours. The article traces the history of mind games on Lions tours back to 1896 in South Africa, citing examples of psychological tricks and trash talking. Verbal jousting is as much a part of the deal as the rugby itself.</p>
