        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a significant manpower shortage, Ukraine's military strategy is showing signs of success in its war of attrition against Russia. By leveraging advanced drone technology and implementing measures to conserve soldiers, such as better artillery use and troop rotation, Ukrainian forces are inflicting steady losses on the enemy while minimizing their own casualties. This article suggests that Russia's attempts to capture key strategic cities have been largely unsuccessful, and time may now be shifting to Ukraine's favor. Commanders on the front line are focused on avoiding direct contact, using technology to counter Russia's larger army and seemingly expendable troops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the psychological relationship between wealth and happiness, arguing that contentment, not money, is the true key to a fulfilling life. The author suggests that happiness is found in appreciating what one already has, rather than constantly desiring more, a concept illustrated by his grandmother-in-law who lived happily on a meager income. True wealth is described as psychological, stemming from low expectations and the realization that one has enough, regardless of their material lifestyle. The central thesis is that happiness is simply the gap between one's expectations and their circumstances, making contentment the ultimate financial skill.</p>

          <p>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, has invested $2 billion in the prediction markets platform Polymarket, valuing the company at approximately $8 billion. The move, which caused ICE's shares to rise, signals a significant step for prediction markets into the financial mainstream. Polymarket, which recently received approval to launch in the U.S., aims to combine its consumer focus with ICE's institutional scale. The deal comes as the prediction market industry is projected to grow substantially, potentially taking market share from the sports gambling sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed by more than 225% after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a Biden-era decision that had blocked the Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road opposed by some for its potential environmental impact. The investment underscores a strategic push to reduce reliance on China's dominance in the critical minerals market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Diversification Strategies Amid S&P 500 Record Highs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 continues to reach new record highs, some financial advisors are cautioning investors against over-reliance on the index for diversification. They note that the market capitalization-weighted index is heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, creating potential volatility risks. To mitigate a possible pullback, experts suggest alternatives such as total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. The key recommendation is to build a balanced portfolio with broader exposure to different asset classes to weather periods when the large-cap index may underperform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Abundant Private Capital Allows Tech Startups to Delay Public Offerings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The median age of companies going public has risen to 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018, as a surge in private capital allows startups to mature longer before an IPO. The growth of alternative investment sources like venture capital, private equity, and sovereign wealth funds provides ample funding, reducing the need to raise capital publicly. This trend has led to a swelling number of private "unicorns" and allows companies to avoid the regulatory burdens and short-term pressures of public markets. Consequently, companies are achieving much larger revenues before their public debut compared to previous decades. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unseasonably warm and sunny weather in the United Kingdom has led to numerous sightings of ladybirds swarming in and around homes. Experts explain that this is normal behavior for this time of year, as the insects seek sheltered, warm places to enter a state of winter inactivity similar to hibernation. The boom in the ladybird population is linked to a very warm spring and summer, which also caused a surge in aphids, their primary food source. The species most commonly found indoors is the invasive harlequin ladybird, which outcompetes some native UK species for resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have proposed the creation of an "open and shared sustainable mega constellation" (OSSMC) of satellites, aiming to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded low-Earth orbit. The project would utilize artificial intelligence to manage a global network, promoting equitable access to space resources for all nations. This initiative is presented as a solution to prevent orbital space from being monopolized by a few powerful entities, such as SpaceX's Starlink, which plans for tens of thousands of satellites. The proposal aligns with China's broader goal of fostering international cooperation in space exploration and technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between pretax (traditional) and Roth 401(k) contributions, financial planners suggest looking beyond your marginal tax rate to your effective tax rate. Your marginal rate is the tax on your last dollar earned, while your effective rate is the total tax paid as a percentage of your total income, which is often much lower. Since your effective tax rate in retirement may be lower than your current marginal rate, making pretax contributions during high-earning years could be more advantageous than commonly believed. This approach encourages a multi-year tax planning perspective, aiming to pay taxes when your overall rate is lowest. (not investment advice)</p>

While the overall number of homes sold has decreased, the proportion bought by investors has grown, indicating their continued significant role in providing market liquidity. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, still dominate the market, accounting for over 90% of investor-owned homes. In contrast, large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters, often shifting capital towards build-to-rent communities rather than exiting the market entirely.
