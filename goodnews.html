          <p>Amber heat health alerts have been issued across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C, posing significant risks to health and social care services. The UK Health Security Agency warns of increased demand on services, difficulties managing medicines, workforce challenges, and potential rises in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with health conditions. The rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing hot weather from Western Europe. Some locations in Lincolnshire and Suffolk have already met the heatwave threshold, with temperatures expected to remain high through Friday.</p>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan warned that US dollar-backed stablecoins could accelerate the ‚Äúdollarisation‚Äù of the international monetary system. He expressed concerns that while other countries are considering their own local-currency stablecoins, only USD-backed stablecoins could have a worldwide influence. This comes as the US Senate passed stablecoin legislation establishing federal guardrails for US dollar-pegged stablecoins, creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. Stablecoins aim to combine the efficiency of digital assets with the reliability of traditional money by pegging their value to fiat currencies.</p>

While there may be personal costs to keeping a commitment when tired or overwhelmed, breaking that commitment can also damage friendships. Friendship researchers suggest that if canceling is necessary, it's best to avoid last-minute cancellations, be honest, and have a good reason, while those being canceled on should offer grace and understanding.</p>
