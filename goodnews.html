          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:34:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert who studied over 200 kids introduces 'emotionally safe parenting' as a superior style that focuses on emotional attunement and resilience. This approach emphasizes accepting children's emotions without dismissal, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents prioritize inner healing and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves inner reflection, empathy, setting boundaries with compassion, and modeling healthy conflict resolution. The optimism score is 80.</p>
