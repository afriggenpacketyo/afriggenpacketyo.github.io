        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential successor for the Fed chair, expressed strong support for initiating a rate-cutting cycle within two weeks, citing the rapid deterioration that can occur in labor markets. He believes current interest rates are 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points above their "neutral" level, warranting multiple cuts over the next few months, with the pace adjusted based on incoming data. Waller, who notably dissented from the July decision to hold rates steady, also acknowledged that tariffs could slow growth but does not foresee a recession in his economic forecast. He further reiterated the critical importance of the Fed's independence, assuring that the central bank will maintain its apolitical stance regardless of leadership changes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has ruled that cutting-edge whole genome sequencing DNA testing can be used in the upcoming trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, setting a new precedent for the state. This advanced method can extract DNA from degraded samples, linking Heuermann, his ex-wife, and daughter to hair strands found on victims. Prosecutors view this as a major victory, while the defense challenges the lab's licensing and the method's accuracy. The technology, which analyzes thousands of DNA variations, is widely used in forensics but marks a significant first for murder trials in New York, potentially strengthening the prosecution's case which also includes other evidence like internet searches and burner phone pings.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts offer a secure, FDIC-insured way to save with fixed interest rates, making them attractive in an inflationary economy. For a $50,000 deposit, the "best" rate isn't always the highest, as short-term CDs currently offer higher rates (e.g., 4.25% for 3 months) but yield less overall interest than longer-term options (e.g., 4.10% for 2 years). Savers must weigh their goal of securing a high rate versus maximizing total interest earned, as early withdrawal penalties can be costly. This article provides a breakdown of potential earnings for different CD terms, helping investors make informed decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis star Novak Djokovic advanced to the US Open semifinals after defeating American Taylor Fritz in a challenging four-set match, despite facing an unusually hostile crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Fans cheered for Djokovic's faults and actively tried to get under his skin, prompting him to confront the chair umpire during the late-night match. Djokovic, who saved 11 of 13 break chances and won many long rallies, described the victory as a "grind," highlighting his resilience. His triumph ensures the American men's singles Grand Slam drought continues since Andy Roddick's win in 2003. Djokovic is now set to face world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated semifinal clash.</p>

          <p>China commemorated the 80th anniversary of its victory in World War II with a grand gala at the Great Hall of the People, following a massive military parade earlier in the day. President Xi Jinping and members of the Politburo greeted surviving Chinese veterans, emphasizing remembrance and reinforcing the Communist Party's narrative of its 14-year struggle against Japanese aggression. The elaborate event, titled "Justice Will Prevail," featured a blend of song, dance, poetry, and drama, showcasing China's growing military might and rising diplomatic stature on the global stage. This celebration serves to underscore China's historical perspective on the war and its current geopolitical position, particularly in challenging the US-dominated global order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet shares jumped 9% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in an antitrust case against Google, allowing the tech giant to avoid a breakup. Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search but will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The ruling also permits Google to continue making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine, though exclusive contracts are prohibited. This outcome is seen as a "monster win" for Google, removing a significant overhang on its stock and bolstering confidence in its core search business and AI initiatives like Gemini.

          <p>England and Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton is reportedly nearing a significant move to rival club Manchester City ahead of Thursday's transfer deadline. With only a year remaining on her contract and no renewal agreed, Manchester United is keen to capitalize on her transfer rather than losing her for free next year, a situation they've faced with other key players recently. In a related development, England midfielder Jess Park is expected to move in the opposite direction, from City to United, and is undergoing a medical examination. United views Park as a high-quality addition, indicating a strategic player exchange between the two prominent football clubs to strengthen their respective squads.</p>

The proposed settlement requires Disney to pay the civil penalty, comply with privacy rules, and implement a review program for YouTube video designations. Disney stated the settlement is limited to its content on YouTube's platform, affirming its commitment to children's privacy and compliance standards.</p>

Rauch argues that this system, developed over centuries, is crucial for navigating disagreements peacefully and staying grounded in reality, especially against modern disinformation campaigns. They explore how authoritarian regimes weaponize confusion and how the human mind often chafes against the uncertainties of a reality-based community. The article emphasizes that despite constant attacks and the decline of traditional media, the inherent human need for reliable information and reality's ultimate triumph will ensure the constitution of knowledge endures, though it requires continuous defense.</p>

The Mercosur agreement, which now requires approval from at least 15 EU member states, would progressively remove tariffs on 91% of EU imports and allow Mercosur agricultural goods into the EU with fewer restrictions. Despite opposition from some EU agricultural sectors concerned about competition, the Commission stressed the economic benefits and robust safeguards for sensitive products. The Mexico deal also aims to boost trade, particularly benefiting EU agriculture exporters and strengthening global partnerships.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" is a global hit, upending K-pop stereotypes by featuring a girl band, HUNTR/X, who are powerful, quirky, and demon-hunting superheroes. The film challenges the image of perfectly styled idols, instead portraying young women who make mistakes, argue, and enjoy life while saving the world. Professor Ray Seol notes this concept offers a new perspective on female representation in K-pop. The movie also breaks musical ground by using behind-the-scenes artists for character voices, like EJAE, whose song "Golden" stormed global charts, reflecting a cultural shift towards stories of resilience and overcoming obstacles, and resonating with diverse audiences worldwide.</p>

          <p>"Phantom energy," or vampire energy, refers to the electricity consumed by devices when they are plugged in but not actively in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of home energy use. Appliances like internet-connected TVs can draw significantly more power in standby mode than regular ones. This wasted electricity contributes to climate change by increasing demand for emissions-releasing power sources. Experts recommend unplugging chargers and unused appliances, or disabling smart features, to reduce both utility bills and carbon emissions. Individual actions, even small ones, can collectively lead to substantial reductions in U.S. emissions and influence broader societal norms towards sustainability.</p>

          <p>A fact-check by DW's data-driven journalism team debunks President Donald Trump's repeated claim that Democrat-led cities inherently have higher crime rates. While a majority of large U.S. cities are led by Democrats and larger cities tend to report higher crime, data analysis shows no direct causal link between a mayor's party affiliation and crime rates. Research from Harvard, MIT, and Boston University, spanning nearly three decades and 400 cities, concluded that mayoral political affiliation has "no detectable impact" on crime or arrest rates. The FBI also advises against ranking cities by crime data without considering complex socioeconomic and geographic variables, noting overall U.S. violent crime has decreased significantly since 1993.</p>
