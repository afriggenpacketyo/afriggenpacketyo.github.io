          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard released statements asserting new intelligence indicates severe damage to Iran's nuclear program, requiring years to rebuild. This contradicts an earlier assessment that suggested a shorter setback. The statements did not address questions about Iran's remaining nuclear capabilities or the movement of enriched uranium.  President Trump claimed the strikes prevented Iran from moving enriched material, and announced upcoming U.S.-Iran talks.</p>
