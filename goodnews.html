          <p>U2 is back in the studio after an eight-year hiatus, prompted by drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s recovery from neck surgery. The band members discussed their recent writing sessions, emphasizing the unique chemistry they rediscovered in creating new music using just bass, drums, guitar, and vocals. Bono noted that this traditional setup feels like an original idea in 2025. They reflected on their career, including stadium tours and revisiting past hits, but expressed their primary interest in creating the 'sound of the future,' which they believe is theirs to make. The band received fellowship of the Ivors' songwriting academy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass' public safety initiatives to avoid city worker layoffs. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than since 1995, and scales back new hires for the Fire Department. Council members voiced concerns over public safety cuts, while others defended the budget as promoting equity and inclusion. The plan aims to avert about 700 city employee layoffs through potential union concessions and tapping into budget stabilization funds.</p>

The country also has a vested interest in addressing climate change after experiencing extreme weather events that caused significant economic damage. The green transition offers economic opportunities and can drive progress across political and economic divides, especially in international investment.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, through airport screening programs. Cases have been reported in international travelers arriving in multiple states. The variant is dominant in China and rising in Asia, prompting health authorities to urge masking and stockpile resources. Preliminary data suggests the variant may be more transmissible, leading the FDA to consider updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming season.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rose to 3.5% in April, the highest level in over two years, driven by surging rice prices. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing rate hikes to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and yen appreciation. Potential oversupply from U.S. tariffs and government subsidies may further reduce inflation.</p>
