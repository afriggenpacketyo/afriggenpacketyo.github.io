          <p>As artificial intelligence usage grows rapidly, researchers are uncovering more cases of potentially harmful AI responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models exacerbate these issues. While red teaming, involving testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is a valuable evaluation method, there are currently insufficient people working in red teams. Researchers recommend adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives to improve understanding of the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases That Hinder Children's Cooperation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, has identified five phrases that often lead to defiance in children. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying. You're fine," trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the expert recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries, such as explaining reasons for decisions and acknowledging feelings. By creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, parents can foster trust and emotional resilience in their children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for the weight loss injection Mounjaro will be available at GP surgeries in England, but only for those who meet very strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. The first group eligible includes individuals with a BMI of 40 or over and four out of five specific conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Some GP practices warn that few patients will qualify immediately, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned about potential supply shortages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become a global leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. The Chinese government initiated plans to dominate future technologies, and the country is now far ahead in the EV sector. This was achieved through long-term planning, significant government subsidies, and dominance in critical supply chains for battery production. Chinese EV makers are now looking to expand their sales overseas, making EVs a mainstream reality in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is considering setting up a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This development follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, though known as a party drug, is being explored for its potential to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy. While esketamine, a nasal spray form of ketamine, has been approved for treatment-resistant depression in Scotland, intravenous ketamine has not, though it can be prescribed 'off-label'.</p>

Ohtani showed progress in his pitching, striking out two in a scoreless inning.
