          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, according to preliminary results, ending two decades of leftist rule. The election occurred amidst Bolivia's worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a US dollar shortage, 23% inflation, and a devalued currency. Paz and his rival, Jorge Quiroga, both campaigned on promises to stabilize the economy, restructure state-owned businesses, and attract foreign investment, while aiming to maintain social welfare programs. Paz's victory signals a significant shift in Bolivia's alliances, moving away from China and Russia towards stronger relations with the United States.</p>

          <h2>LiDAR Founder Challenges Elon Musk's Vision-Only Self-Driving Approach</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, the world's leading LiDAR maker, asserts that a multi-sensor system is safer and more effective for self-driving vehicles than Tesla CEO Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu argues that vision-only systems struggle with "corner cases" and cannot achieve higher levels of driving automation (Level 3 or 4) without additional sensors like LiDAR. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu highlights significant cost reductions and performance improvements in LiDAR technology. Other auto executives, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, also emphasize LiDAR's "mission critical" role for enhanced safety and perception in diverse driving conditions.</p>

          <p>Analysts polled by Reuters anticipate a slowdown in China's economic growth for the third quarter, with official data expected to confirm a 4.8% GDP increase year-on-year, down from 5.2% in the previous quarter.

Retail sales and industrial production are also expected to show slower growth in September. Despite these forecasts, official data for September has indicated continued resilience in China's exports amidst ongoing tensions with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles art exhibit, "Monuments," features 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson. Curator Hamza Walker aims to challenge the "Lost Cause ideology" by presenting these figures as symbols of white supremacy and slavery. Artist Kara Walker's reconstructed "Unmanned Drone" sculpture of Stonewall Jackson further reimagines these historical figures. The exhibit opens amid ongoing debate about Confederate symbols and their place in public spaces, offering a critical perspective on American history and its interpretations.</p>

          <p>Career coach Helen Tupper suggests a simple linguistic shift from "I can't" to "I don't" to effectively set boundaries and push back at work. "I don't" is presented as a more definitive statement that discourages negotiation, helping individuals protect their personal time and prevent burnout. TV chef Lorraine Pascale shared her experience of burnout due to an inability to say no, which manifested physically and mentally. Experts emphasize adjusting goals to current capacity and sticking to routines to complete the "stress cycle" and improve well-being, highlighting the importance of self-care in demanding professional environments.</p>

          <p>Millions across India are celebrating Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, with traditional lamps, sweets, and family gatherings. This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of "green crackers" in Delhi, ending a ban in place since 2020, to mitigate air pollution concerns exacerbated during the winter months. While these crackers claim to emit less pollution, their actual effectiveness is debated, and past restrictions have often been flouted. Beyond fireworks, Diwali boosts the economy as people shop for new clothes, decorate homes, create rangoli designs, and worship Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, drawing participation from diverse communities.</p>

Blanchett, who lives locally, expressed awe for the project, which stores over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species globally. Initially seen as a "doomsday vault," the MSB now focuses on using its collection for environmental restoration projects worldwide, including re-seeding chalk grasslands and aiding recovery after Australian wildfires. King Charles also participated in a podcast about the initiative, highlighting concerns over plant species loss, as Blanchett emphasizes the critical role of these "insurance policies" for biodiversity.</p>

A personal exchange between Witkoff and Hamas's top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, who both had lost sons, transformed the negotiation dynamic. Trump's guarantee of U.S. backing for the deal, ensuring fair treatment and non-violation, ultimately helped secure the agreement, leading to a moment of shared relief and hugs between Israeli and Qatari negotiators.</p>

Past plans, like Deng Xiaoping's "Reform and Opening Up" in 1981, transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" and the outsourcing of millions of Western jobs. The 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, giving China a near monopoly on rare earth supply chains and global leadership in EVs and renewables. More recently, "high quality development" aims for technological self-reliance, challenging American dominance and sparking international diplomatic rows over Chinese tech.</p>

Skills minister Baroness Jacqui Smith emphasized that V-levels will build on the practical, employment-focused aspects of existing qualifications, allowing students to combine them with A-levels or T-levels.

The article argues that global supply chains and financial ties create strong domestic interests in avoiding war between major powers.
