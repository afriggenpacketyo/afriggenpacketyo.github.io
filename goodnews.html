          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely removed from the Boeing 737 MAX 8, some using emergency slides, as smoke was seen billowing from the aircraft. The fire department later confirmed they extinguished a fire, which the airline attributed to a maintenance issue with a tire. While five people were evaluated for minor issues at the scene, operations at the airport have since returned to normal.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has responded to critical comments made by NFL legend Terry Bradshaw, who had previously expressed disapproval of Rodgers joining the team. In an interview, Rodgers acknowledged Bradshaw's legendary status and suggested that Bradshaw's opinion was based on a public persona rather than personal knowledge. Extending an olive branch, Rodgers expressed a desire to get to know Bradshaw on a deeper level and even joked about Bradshaw's "chew on bark" comment. He emphasized his respect for past NFL greats who paved the way for current players.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is attempting to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter with remarkable accuracy. Despite its historical significance, the invention has been dismissed by some as mythical and was even removed from school curriculums. Supported by modern scientific principles and new clues, scientists are now aiming to restore the lost wonder and validate its advanced ancient technology.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed ICE train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were trapped inside a tunnel for over six hours due to a power failure. The outage occurred shortly after departure, disabling the air conditioning and lights and leaving passengers stuck in the heat. The rescue operation was prolonged when some individuals exited the train and walked into the tunnel, forcing a secondary power-down for safety reasons. All passengers were eventually evacuated via emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with two people receiving on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief to the team and its fans, who feared a more serious, long-term injury. Judge, who leads the major leagues in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days. He hopes to return initially as a designated hitter, as the injury primarily affects his ability to throw.</p>

          <p>With the intense emotional highs and lows of tournament football, experts are providing tips on how fans can manage the physical and psychological effects of stress. Psychologists explain that major matches trigger hormonal responses, including rushes of adrenaline and cortisol, which can elevate heart rates and impact behavior even after the game. To cope, they advise getting good rest, having a clear plan for match day, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. The article suggests reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system, which has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, leading to persistent cloud cover. This pattern has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring cold, deep ocean water to the surface, further cooling the air. While some residents enjoy the temperate weather, experts caution that the region's hottest days often occur in September and October.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to offer greater protection to pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, aiming to prevent establishments from facing closure due to new neighbors. The government hopes these reforms will help revitalize struggling town centers by making it easier to open new bars, expand outdoor areas, and promote live performances. The changes aim to reverse the steady decline in the number of pubs across the country.</p>

During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects.

In a short video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's newfound attention while steering the conversation back to its core business of data workflow automation. The move is a clear attempt by the company to manage the public relations fallout from the embarrassing incident.</p>
