His charisma and on-field achievements made him a cultural icon during Japan's rapid economic growth, and his retirement was a major national news event.

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's remarks about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst's comment, "Well, we're all going to die," made at a town hall meeting, drew criticism and prompted Scholten to enter the race. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and professional baseball player, aims to make the election a referendum on President Trump's trade policy, particularly its impact on Iowa soybean farmers. Democrats have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, making this a challenging but potentially impactful campaign.</p>

At about 10:46 a.m., Sunny jumped off a branch, flapped her wings, and flew away, while her sister, Gizmo, remained in the nest. Friends of Big Bear Valley noted that the eaglets had been practicing for days, flapping their wings and jumping on the outer rails of the nest. It is not yet clear where Sunny flew off too, but young eagles oftentimes return to the nest relatively quickly after their first flight.</p>
