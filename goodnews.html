          <p>This article discusses a Chinese team's development of an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers. The breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, allows drones to potentially outperform humans in complex flight missions. The article explains that aerobatic flight involves high-risk maneuvers rarely used in conventional flight, drawing inspiration from aerial acrobatics observed in nature. The article quotes Gao Fei, an associate professor at Zhejiang University, emphasizing the importance of transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards' for drone flight paradigms.</p>
