          <p>Chinese humanoid robotics startup X Square Robot has secured approximately $100 million in a new funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to around $280 million. The company, which aims to create "robotic butlers" within five years, also released an open-source AI model for robotics called Wall-OSS to accelerate development in the field. Despite the significant investment and ambitious goals, the startup acknowledges that AI for robotics lags behind conversational AI and that mass-market consumer robots are still years away. The company plans to prepare for an IPO next year while expanding sales to commercial clients.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by Chinese and American scientists has determined that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a finding that challenges previous models of the planet's composition. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, researchers found a solid core approximately 600km in radius, which is proportionally similar to Earth's. This discovery is significant because it was believed Mars had not cooled sufficiently to form a solid core, suggesting planetary cooling processes may be faster than previously thought. The finding places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as celestial bodies in our solar system confirmed to have solid inner cores.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a significant 1.5% rise after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation over the weekend. Investors reacted positively to the news, with the Topix index also climbing to a record high, reportedly due to excitement over potential pro-growth successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae. The market's response reflects anticipation of policies focused on deregulation and growth, despite the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar. This political shift introduces a period of uncertainty but has initially been welcomed by financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

During the arrests, police recovered approximately $10,000 in cash, 26 checks, and seized several firearms and drugs from the suspects' residences.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Suffolk, England, experienced the shock of a lifetime when she gave birth to a baby boy in a football club toilet, having had no idea she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson reported no symptoms, such as feeling the baby move, and attributed her hip pain to a pre-existing condition. The surprise birth occurred after a match attended by 600 people, where she felt a sudden urge to push in the restroom. This phenomenon, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects approximately one in 2,500 births, where the mother remains unaware of the baby until labor begins.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring its preservation ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2026. The carousel, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator and a subsequent ownership dispute. Built in 1926, the merry-go-round is one of the few remaining wooden carousels of its kind and features hand-carved horses by famed artist Charles Looff. The city plans to undertake significant repairs before reopening the attraction as part of a broader park restoration project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly allocating capital to Asia to capitalize on the region's booming artificial intelligence sector. According to Bank of America, a weakening U.S. dollar and the prospect of easier Federal Reserve monetary policy are driving this shift. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, investment has slowed this year, with inflows now evenly split between U.S. and international markets. The global AI market is projected to grow to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a substantial portion expected to be deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a spectacular "Blood Moon," visible to observers across Asia, as well as parts of Europe and Africa. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns perfectly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the moon a deep reddish hue. This color is the result of sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, where shorter blue wavelengths are filtered out, allowing longer red wavelengths to reach the moon. The event, which has captivated civilizations for millennia, was best viewed in Asia, including India and China.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland suffered a 3-1 defeat to Germany in their Group A qualifying match, despite a competitive performance for much of the game. Germany took an early lead through Serge Gnabry, but Isaac Price scored an equalizer for Northern Ireland from a corner. The game remained level until two quick goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz in the second half secured the victory for Germany. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill expressed disappointment but pride in his team's display, noting that defensive lapses and a lack of squad depth were key factors in the loss.</p>
