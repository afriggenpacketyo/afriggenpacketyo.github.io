          <p>Analysts suggest that China's recent anti-corruption crackdown within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) does not indicate a weakening of President Xi Jinping's control over the military. The article states that the campaign's effect on the military's war readiness and modernization remains limited. The investigation has targeted members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), including Miao Hua, and former defense ministers Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, all suspected of corruption. This sweeping campaign signals an effort to maintain discipline and loyalty within the ranks. </p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory following scrutiny over its experimentation practices. The White Coat Waste (WCW) project reported the lab allegedly pumped pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and subjected them to septic shock for deadly experiments. The announcement follows pressure from figures like Elon Musk and praise from groups like PETA. The closure reflects a broader trend of phasing out animal testing, with the FDA and EPA also announcing reductions in animal testing requirements. </p>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing, experts caution against over-relying on the procedure, citing costs and no guarantees. Egg freezing can cost upwards of $12,000, plus storage fees, and the medical risks increase with age. Critics also argue that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be doing so to keep female employees at their desks. Some fertility specialists also worry about the emphasis on profits, which may create warped incentives. </p>
