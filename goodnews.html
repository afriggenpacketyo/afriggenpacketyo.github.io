          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Jalen Carter was ejected from a game against the Dallas Cowboys after being seen spitting in the direction of Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott. The incident occurred after some trash talk between players, and the ejection sparked anger among NFL fans. The league could suspend Carter depending on his remorse, as respect for the opponent is a key talking point among the league, clubs, and players. Carter had a successful season in 2024, with 4.5 sacks and 42 total tackles, earning his first Pro Bowl selection. The incident raises concerns about player conduct and sportsmanship on the field.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have pledged to provide postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, including an international force on land, sea, and air. These troops would not be deployed on the frontline but would aim to prevent any new major aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the move as a serious concrete step, with the US contributions to the guarantees to be finalized soon. The Kremlin has stated that western countries cannot provide security guarantees for Ukraine that would suit Russia. This international effort underscores the ongoing commitment to Ukraine's security and stability.</p>

          <p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate in New York City after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of mayoral debates. Cuomo challenged Mamdani to five debates, pushing for other candidates to end their campaigns, but Mamdani responded by proposing a debate with Trump himself. Trump has expressed his dislike for a communist becoming mayor and suggested that some candidates should drop out to create a one-on-one race. The mayoral race is currently a four-man race, with Mamdani leading in the polls, and is generating significant political discussion.</p>

          <p>President Trump has warned that he will impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not shift production to the U.S., but will spare firms like Apple that expand investments domestically. Trump noted that Tim Cook would be in "pretty good shape" regarding the potential import levies. The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, and major companies like TSMC and Samsung Electronics have committed billions to building plants in the U.S. Trump offered few details on the tariffs, saying there will not be a tariff if companies are building or planning to build in the US. The move aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing in the semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that employers are increasingly emphasizing AI skills in job postings and are willing to pay premium salaries for them. Job postings that mentioned at least one AI skill advertised salaries 28% higher on average than those that listed none, representing roughly $18,000 more per year. The study also noted three fields with the largest premium: customer and client support, sales, and manufacturing and production. While many of the AI skills required high technical expertise, the most commonly-listed ones were often quite general, such as proficiency in the use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot. AI literacy is becoming essential across various career areas.</p>

          <p>Former US president Joe Biden has undergone surgery for skin cancer, according to his spokesperson. He had Mohs surgery, which involves removing layers of tissue and examining them under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Biden previously had a basal cell carcinoma removed from his chest in 2023, and his wife, Jill, also had two basal cell carcinomas removed. He also revealed in May that he had stage-four prostate cancer, which had spread to his bones, but the disease appears to be hormone-sensitive. His health continues to be monitored.</p>

          <p>A US lawyer named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Facebook for repeatedly suspending his account and falsely accusing him of "impersonating a celebrity." Zuckerberg claims his account has been disabled five times in eight years, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business.

          <p>China's recent military parade showcased new stealth drones, leading military observers to speculate about their capabilities. Some experts believe the advanced aircraft are capable of hypersonic cruising, improved stealth, and elevated air combat power. The aircraft displayed included reconnaissance-strike integrated drones, unmanned wingplanes, uncrewed air combat aircraft, and shipborne uncrewed helicopters. These drones are capable of stealth strikes, wide-area coverage, and autonomous coordination, creating a new style of future air combat. The GJ-11 drone, a strike-focused platform with a high degree of stealth, was among the identified aircraft. The developments indicate China's growing focus on advanced drone technology.</p>

He predicted that many major tech companies will start to develop agentic browsers, but that companies would be wary of the AI agents' autonomy.
