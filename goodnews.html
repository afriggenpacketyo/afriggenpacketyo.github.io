          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed that he recently underwent surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. The 58-year-old shared photos on Instagram showing a large bandage and subsequent stitches on the side of his jaw, using the experience to issue a public health warning. Ramsay urged his millions of followers to remember to use sunscreen, humorously noting that the procedure was not a facelift. The announcement was met with well-wishes from fans, who praised him for raising awareness about sun safety.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which humorously and pointedly explores the frustrations of dating despite achieving pop superstardom. Following her successful album "Short n' Sweet," this new work continues her collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff, blending '70s pop, disco, and country sounds. The album's lyrics detail encounters with incompetent and disappointing men, lampooning the modern dating scene from the perspective of a successful woman. While some lyrics are seen as less sharp than her previous work, the album is praised for its clever songwriting and Carpenter's versatile vocal performance.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, following their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" in what she later clarified was a reference to tennis etiquette, specifically a perceived failure to apologize for a net cord. Ostapenko stated that English is not her first language and that she understands how her words could have been offensive beyond the court. The incident had drawn criticism and sparked debate within the tennis community.</p>

The win extends the Red Roses' unbeaten streak to 29 games. For Samoa, a team that had to crowdfund its tournament participation, a successful penalty kick was a celebrated moment in a difficult match.</p>

          <p>Health experts are offering consolidated advice on managing screen time for children, emphasizing different needs at various developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-control. As children enter kindergarten and elementary school, limited and supervised screen time is advised to foster imagination, social skills, and a moral compass. While acknowledging the social necessity of digital interaction for adolescents, experts stress the importance of monitoring content, setting clear rules, and maintaining open communication to prevent potential harm and addictive habits.</p>

Since joining on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been in exceptional form, revitalizing his career after a season with limited playing time. His recent displays have intensified discussions about his exclusion from the latest England national team squad, with manager Thomas Tuchel citing strong competition for his position. Everton boss David Moyes praised Grealish's impact, suggesting the player is thriving with more consistent game time and a desire to prove his capabilities.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly during a family golf outing, putting an end to viral social media rumors about his death. The hashtags "Trump Is Dead" and "Where Is Trump?" trended after recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in should a tragedy occur, which fueled speculation. Trump, 79, was photographed at the White House before heading to his Virginia golf course. This appearance also follows recent public concern over his health after photos showed bruising on his hand, which his physician attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigations traced the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the disease.</p>

          <p>Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, recently described his financial journey, stating that after taking a decade to earn his first million dollars, wealth began to accumulate much more rapidly. He claims he can now earn as much as $5 million in a single week, attributing the acceleration to the principle of compound growth once a certain threshold is passed. Since reacquiring Barstool from Penn Entertainment for $1, Portnoy has expanded the brand's visibility, notably through a new content deal with Fox Sports for its college football coverage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three common heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. A UK-based study involving over 200 GP surgeries showed the device significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending data to the cloud for instant analysis. This innovation is being hailed as a potential game-changer for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner and improve outcomes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, offers a polished and well-crafted take on the 1984 Troma cult classic. While maintaining the original's gore and goofy parody, this version replaces the low-budget trashiness with higher production values and a more sincere emotional core. Dinklage plays a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, becomes a mutant hero fighting a villainous corporation run by a CEO played by Kevin Bacon. The film functions as a diverting homage that pokes fun at superhero tropes but may lack the offensive, outsider charm that defined the original.</p>
