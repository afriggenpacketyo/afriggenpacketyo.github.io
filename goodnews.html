          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of its emergency docket, which has seen a surge in appeals from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock, inevitably leading to more legal challenges requiring the court's intervention. He noted that the court has made procedural changes to handle these cases, including scheduling emergency oral arguments, and expressed a preference for more process. Kavanaugh also emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices, stating they are all patriots thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues, even when they disagree.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling extends their legal status and deportation protections while the case proceeds, with the next hearing scheduled for November. In a sharply worded order, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated the administration's decision appeared predetermined and motivated by racial animus, rather than an objective review of country conditions. The judge's order provides a reprieve for individuals who have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for years, some for over two decades.</p>

          <p>In the NFL's Hall of Fame Game, the Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Detroit Lions 34-7, with backup quarterback Trey Lance delivering a noteworthy performance. Lance, competing for the No. 2 spot, completed 13 of 20 passes for 120 yards and two touchdowns, appearing sharp and polished. Other key observations from the preseason opener included a strong showing from rookie cornerback Nikko Reed, who had a 46-yard interception return, and an early look at the Chargers' unresolved issues on the interior offensive line. The game also marked the official debut of the NFL's virtual measurement system for first-down rulings.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analysts' expectations. While AWS remains the market leader in cloud infrastructure, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates for the same period. AWS continues to be a major profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized the scale of AWS's business and highlighted ongoing supply constraints, particularly for power, needed to meet the booming demand for artificial intelligence services.

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump says will be his "gift to the country." The new building, which will replace the current East Wing, is intended to provide a permanent venue for large-scale events that are currently held in tents on the South Lawn. According to the White House, funding will come from President Trump and other "patriot donors." This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, continuing Trump's tradition of making significant changes to the White House.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a spectacular debut on the stock market, with its shares soaring 250% on the first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. The successful IPO has created immense paper wealth for its early venture capital backers, including Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia, who collectively hold a stake worth around $24 billion. The outcome is a significant win for the tech industry, which has seen a slow IPO market in recent years. Figma's public offering was unexpected, as it had previously agreed to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion before the deal collapsed due to regulatory pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Potato Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor Through Hybridization</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered that the modern potato evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers solved the long-standing puzzle of the potato's origin by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a hybridization event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancient tomato species provided the crucial genetic combination necessary for tuber formation. This discovery demonstrates how interbreeding between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and the emergence of new species, providing a fascinating insight into plant evolution.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, beating analyst expectations. Sales of the iPhone set a new June quarter record, and the services division also reached an all-time high. Despite the positive performance, the company provided little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, which has tempered investor enthusiasm. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that AI is a profound technology and that the company is significantly increasing its investment, but the stock remains an AI "show me" story for many on Wall Street.

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument to honor an individual African American at the state capitol, a site currently dominated by statues of White men, many with Confederate ties. The project, made possible by a bipartisan legislative push, is seen as a step toward telling a more complete story of the state's history. The 12-foot-tall sculpture is being created by artist Basil Watson to celebrate Smalls' journey and legacy.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell after its second-quarter earnings report, despite beating revenue and profit expectations. While the results were strong, a modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, AWS, and a mixed forecast for the next quarter disappointed some investors. However, this article argues the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as the core drivers of the company's value, AWS and advertising, both showed healthy growth. The analysis suggests the market is nitpicking, and that the long-term thesis for Amazon remains intact as it continues to lower costs and expand margins in its key high-growth businesses.
