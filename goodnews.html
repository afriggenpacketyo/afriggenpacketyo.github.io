          <h2>Chinese Study of Feather Fossils Reveals Bird Evolution</h2>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which were crucial for early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years. The study highlights the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as an essential feature of bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly.</p>

          <h2>Study Shows First Bacteria Encountered Can Protect From Hospitalization</h2>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study shows that beneficial bacteria can halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. One particular bacterium, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect, reducing the likelihood of hospitalization due to lung infections.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are concerned that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely. There are concerns about the potential harm to unborn babies and the lack of medical advice for those buying the drugs online. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant.</p>

This action marks a significant departure from the administration's defiant stance in other immigration matters.
