          <p>Lalo Schifrin, the Argentine-born composer, pianist, and conductor renowned for creating the iconic theme for "Mission: Impossible," has passed away at the age of 93. His prolific career spanned film and television, earning him six Oscar nominations and four Grammy Awards for scores like "Cool Hand Luke" and "Dirty Harry." Schifrin's instantly recognizable "Mission: Impossible" theme, written in an unusual 5/4 time signature, became a cultural touchstone and a hallmark of the long-running franchise.

          <p>A large, bright meteorite, described as a fireball, streaked across the skies of Georgia and South Carolina before exploding with the energy equivalent of 20 tons of TNT. NASA reported that the meteor, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It disintegrated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, creating a pressure wave that resulted in loud booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event, which experts suggest may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, a phenomenon typically active in late June.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city particularly vulnerable to the Urban Heat Island effect, an innovative project is transforming a single neighborhood block into a model for cooling dense urban areas. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, employs a multi-pronged strategy that includes planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with heat-reflecting light colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures are designed to combat peak temperatures that can be up to 20 degrees hotter than in greener areas. As climate change intensifies heat waves, this urban laboratory provides a practical template for other cities seeking to protect residents and improve livability through strategic green infrastructure.</p>

At a news conference, leaders from various Asian communities warned that the crackdown could easily expand into their neighborhoods. They emphasized that unity is crucial for protection, as both communities face fear and disruption from the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement, which has shifted focus to long-term residents without criminal records.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration may extend the 90-day pause on its 'reciprocal tariffs' scheme, which is set to expire on July 9, according to the White House. This development comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks aimed at securing concessions on the higher duties. A White House spokeswoman stated that the deadline is "not critical" and that the president could extend it if trading partners continue to negotiate in good faith. The policy applies country-specific tariffs to about 60 trading partners with significant trade surpluses with the U.S., with Japan facing a potential total tariff rate of 24 percent if a deal is not reached.</p>

Mac√≠as, leader of the powerful 'Los Choneros' gang and wanted in the U.S. on cocaine trafficking charges, was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape in early 2024 triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador, including riots, kidnappings, and the storming of a TV station, prompting the government to declare a state of internal armed conflict. President Daniel Noboa announced the arrest as a major victory, stating that Ecuador is awaiting a U.S. response regarding his extradition.</p>

As part of a plea deal, Navarro admitted to funneling tens of thousands of dollars in donations for personal use, including trips and legal fees, often through his mother and a friend. The felony conviction forfeits his right to vote or hold office, ending a controversial political career where he gained support from high-profile right-wing figures but never won an election.

This expansion contributed to what he describes as a 60-fold increase in rates, turning a narrowly defined, severe disorder into a much more common spectrum. His commentary provides a unique insider's perspective on the complex interplay between psychiatric definitions, clinical practice, and societal trends in public health.</p>

A 19-year-old in Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive the treatment, which targets a faulty gene that disrupts the immune system and has been fatal for several of her relatives. The drug, taken as a daily tablet, works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function normally. This breakthrough is the culmination of 12 years of research, moving from the discovery of the disease to an approved NHS treatment, potentially changing the lives of up to 50 patients in England.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Stock Market Rally is Broad and Bullish</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the current stock market rally is much broader than critics claim, refuting warnings that its narrow leadership made it unsustainable. He pointed to a diverse group of top S&P 500 performers from a single day to illustrate his point, including a solar company (Enphase), a copper miner (Freeport-McMoRan), a crypto platform (Coinbase), and a biotech outfit (Incyte). Cramer argued that this wide range of successful sectors demonstrates the market's underlying strength. He declared that those who bet against the market due to its perceived narrowness are now being proven wrong by the broad-based bullish activity. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the third consecutive year of collaboration for Lanthimos, Stone, and Plemons, following "Poor Things" and "Kinds of Kindness." The trailer showcases Lanthimos's signature bizarre and stylized tone, promising another uniquely unsettling cinematic experience.</p>
