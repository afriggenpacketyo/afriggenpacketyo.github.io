          <p>Brazilian police have arrested two suspects, reported to be fans of Lady Gaga, who were allegedly planning an attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach using improvised explosives. The suspects are part of an online group that promotes hate speech and encourages violence, with one also found in possession of child pornography. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans. The concert proceeded without incident, and Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the fact.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on track to become an official city named Starbase, pending final approval. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by local voters, most of whom are SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase has drawn criticism from those who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. SpaceX officials have said the city authority would streamline launch operations, but critics argue the beach closure authority should remain with the county government.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he refused to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence defied Trump by declining to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during a Congressional session targeted by rioters. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>
