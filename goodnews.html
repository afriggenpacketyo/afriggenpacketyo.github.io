          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has ranked 348 U.S. cities to identify the best job markets, with Bend, Oregon, claiming the top spot. The ranking was based on metrics including unemployment rate, income growth, health insurance coverage, commute times, and remote work prevalence. Bend was recognized for its low unemployment and a remarkable 44% median income growth from 2020 to 2023. Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington, secured the second and third positions, respectively. The report also highlighted cities excelling in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for employer-sponsored healthcare and Frisco, Texas, for remote work opportunities.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are experiencing a notable rotation as the new quarter begins, with many of the first half's winning momentum stocks selling off while undervalued laggards see a surge. Technology and communication services sectors, including high-flyers in AI and cybersecurity, faced declines. In contrast, previously underperforming sectors like healthcare and certain industrials, including names like Bristol Myers and Honeywell, have gained. Analysts are cautious about whether this shift in market leadership will be sustained or is merely a temporary fluctuation, advising investors to remain principled in their strategies.

          <p>A provision within the recently passed Senate budget package aims to eliminate federal income tax on tips for service industry workers, a key proposal from the Trump administration. The measure would create a new tax deduction, though the House and Senate versions differ on the deduction limit and income eligibility caps. Critics argue the temporary tax break, set to expire in 2028, would not benefit the lowest-wage workers who often have no federal tax liability to begin with. Proponents, however, claim it would increase the take-home pay for millions of workers in tipped professions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of high food prices, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had added to egg-based orders. The chain implemented the temporary charge in February after an avian flu outbreak caused egg prices to soar to record highs. Since then, wholesale and retail prices have begun to stabilize, allowing the popular 24-hour diner chain, which serves over 270 million eggs annually, to eliminate the extra fee. The move signals a welcome relief from the runaway food inflation that has frustrated consumers over the past year.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The proposed tax targeted projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, and industry groups warned it would have added billions to their tax burden. Following its removal, shares for major renewable developers like NextEra Energy and AES rose, along with solar-related ETFs. Despite this change, industry leaders remain critical of the overall bill, stating it still undermines America's progress in renewable energy and manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>
