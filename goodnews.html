          <p>Johnny 5, the youngest son of the late Jenni Rivera, has released his debut album titled "5 por 5," which features five songs spanning various genres, including corridos and experimental tracks blending banda sounds with alternative and rock elements. The album is a collaboration with producer Ulises Lozano, known as "El Licenciado" from the group Kinky, and includes a song called "72" dedicated to his mother, though he intends for it to resonate with any woman. Johnny 5 expresses that making music has been cathartic, helping him heal from past wounds, and he hopes his music can do the same for others, drawing inspiration from both old-school regional Mexican artists and English-language musicians like Michael Jackson and The Beatles. This release marks a significant achievement for Johnny, who lost both his parents at a young age, as he continues to honor his mother's legacy while forging his own path in the music industry.</p>

The company's Android smartphones and feature phones marketed from June onward will no longer include the Docomo emoji set, as Google's emoji have become more globally prevalent. The Docomo emoji were introduced in 1999 with the company's i-mode service, which is also set to be terminated in 2026. In 2016, NTT Docomo's set of 176 emoji was added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, recognized for their role in reasserting the human element in electronic communication.</p>

Many people are unfamiliar with portable toilets, leading to misuse and exacerbating the problem, and experts emphasize the importance of education and stockpiling portable toilets to prevent "toilet panic." Educators are now teaching elementary school students how to use portable toilets to prepare them for future emergencies, and the government is urged to prioritize sanitation in disaster planning.</p>

          <p>European startup founders and venture capitalists are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's intense "996" work culture (9 am to 9 pm, six days a week) in order to compete globally. While some argue that longer hours are necessary to catch up with the U.S. and China, many European leaders believe that sustainable innovation and work-life balance are more conducive to long-term success. Concerns have been raised about the negative impact of overwork on employee retention, wellbeing, and creativity. Instead of increasing working hours, founders are calling for more funding and resources to strengthen Europe's startup ecosystem and foster innovation.</p>

Registered nonresidents will receive information on local events and services, and the government hopes to encourage people to live and work in multiple areas to facilitate the flow of city dwellers into rural regions.

The Women's History Museum of Zambia is researching Sona and documenting other indigenous knowledge, aiming to challenge the misconception that African societies lacked their own knowledge systems.

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to combatting drug-resistant superbug infections. The pills, packed with beneficial bacteria, aim to flush out superbugs from the gut and replace them with a healthy microbial balance, and early data suggests promising results in tackling infections resistant to antibiotics. The study, conducted on 41 patients, demonstrated that patients were willing to take the pills and that the donor bacteria persisted in the bowels for at least a month. Scientists believe the donated bacteria can compete with superbugs for resources, potentially eliminating them or reducing their levels to a manageable state, while also increasing the diversity of gut bacteria, which promotes colonisation resistance.</p>
