          <p>China is planning to boost its gold production by 5-10% over the next three years, according to a recent action plan released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This initiative involves using new mining technologies and digging deeper to access gold reserves, driven by soaring demand amid geopolitical tensions. The ministry emphasizes that gold is a strategic mineral resource vital for maintaining national industrial and financial security, with the goal of promoting high-quality development and safety in the gold industry. China has been the world's top gold consumer for 12 years, producing 377.24 tonnes last year, making it the largest producer globally for 18 years. Optimism is high as China is attempting to take control of their gold production, but geopolitical tensions are still a concern.</p>

          <p>German police have initiated a nationwide operation targeting hate speech online, focusing on individuals suspected of inciting hostility and insulting politicians. The investigations primarily target radical right-wing material and unlawful insults, with North Rhine-Westphalia seeing significant police deployments. Authorities are urging the public to report instances of hate speech online, reflecting a growing concern over the rise in such violations. Recent data indicates a substantial increase in hate speech violations, having quadrupled since 2021, prompting the government to take decisive action to combat online extremism and protect public figures.

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched four individuals into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket as part of the Axiom Space Ax-4 mission, marking the fourth private mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew, including retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, will spend 14 days on the ISS conducting approximately 60 experiments across various scientific disciplines. The mission faced multiple delays due to weather and a leak on the ISS's Zvedzda service module, but NASA confirmed the pressure was stable before giving the go-ahead. This mission signifies the return to human spaceflight for Poland and Hungary after more than 40 years, and utilizes a brand new SpaceX Dragon spacecraft designed for transporting civil and commercial astronauts to low-Earth orbit. The launch represents the 18th time SpaceX has launched humans into orbit.</p>

Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes.

          <p>LaVon Bracy Davis defeated her brother, Randolph Bracy, to become the Democratic nominee for a state senate seat in Florida, in a local election marked by sibling rivalry. Their mother served as LaVon's campaign manager, and the Thompson family endorsed her as well. Ms. Bracy Davis is expected to win the general election in September in this liberal pocket of the state. The siblings have a history of serving in the state legislature, with Mr. Bracy having held a different seat in the state senate until he decided to run for the US House of Representatives in 2022.</p>

          <p>Michael Conforto had a strong performance in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against the Rockies, going two for five with a double and a three-run home run. This marked his first multi-hit effort since May 27 and his first game with multiple RBIs this season. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the upcoming month is critical for Conforto, with the team evaluating potential roster changes before the trade deadline. The Dodgers have remained wary of shopping for a potential replacement, as Conforto showed a long-awaited glimpse of his potential.</p>

          <p>China is implementing more strategies for foreign institutions to use the yuan, as international confidence in the U.S. dollar weakens. These actions aim to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar, even though it remains the world's primary currency. The People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng discussed ways to reduce excessive reliance on a single sovereign currency and announced plans to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai. Beijing is focusing on the futures market and promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan, but strict capital controls and geopolitical risks remain challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo has conceded in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary to state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in a stunning political upset. Cuomo, the state's former governor, was attempting a political comeback after resigning from office in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, had "won" the primary race. If elected, Mamdani would be the first Muslim and Indian American to lead the nation's largest city.</p>

          <p>A controversial proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was stripped from a Republican tax and spending bill for violating Senate rules. Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) had advanced the mandate to sell up to 3.3 million acres of public land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management for housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal didn‚Äôt pass muster under the Byrd Rule. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, but Lee has vowed to continue the fight.</p>
