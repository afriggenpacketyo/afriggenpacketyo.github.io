          <p>During a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was involved in an unusual incident on the sideline. While celebrating a play, Lamb, who was not playing in the game, inadvertently collided with a sideline official. Neither person was injured, but the Cowboys received a penalty for sideline interference because Lamb was standing in the restricted area. The referee explained that the contact resulted in an automatic foul, adding a bizarre moment to the preseason matchup.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a remarkable 13% weekly rally, its best in over five years, which this article attributes to a significant short squeeze. Despite negative sentiment from short-sellers, who bet against the company due to its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential antitrust issues, the stock soared. The rally was so powerful it masked negative trends in the broader market, as indicated by the disparity between the market-cap-weighted and equal-weight S&P 500 indexes. The squeeze was intensified by positive developments, such as former President Trump's endorsement of Apple's U.S. investment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and passed away at age 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a leader who dared to venture to places others would not. He praised Lovell's voyages as being driven not by fame but by the challenge of exploration itself. Lovell famously reported "Houston, we've had a problem" after an oxygen tank explosion crippled his spacecraft, leading to a "successful failure" where the crew returned safely against all odds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is a crucial tool for career advancement, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She suggests that a personal brand, defined as what people know you for, allows introverts to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents, which might otherwise be underestimated. Chan recommends starting with small, consistent actions, like posting one professional update a week or sending one networking email a month, to build visibility. She emphasizes that a brand is built through both online presence and offline interests.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores the Theological and Enigmatic Core of Novelist Muriel Spark's Work</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Frances Wilson's new biography, "Electric Spark: The Enigma of Dame Muriel," highlights the often-overlooked religious dimension of the celebrated comic novelist's work. While known for her wit, Muriel Spark was a devout Catholic convert whose writing was deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job. The article posits that Spark explored theological themes of divine judgment and human fallibility through her narrative structure, often playing God with her characters by revealing their fates early in her stories. This technique forced readers to focus not on what would happen, but on the complex interplay of providence and free will.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old man from Ohio, Jason Lee, and his family saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical. The primary motivation was to allow their young son to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to immerse themselves in the culture. The career break has been transformative, allowing them to focus on health, family, and re-evaluating their professional goals, leading them to prioritize happiness over high salaries. The experience has been so positive that they are now expecting their second child, born in Taiwan, before returning to the U.S.</p>
