          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against a Trump administration order that suspended access to asylum for individuals crossing the southern border. The court determined that the president does not have the authority under the constitution or federal law to implement such a sweeping ban. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by several immigrant rights groups, including the ACLU. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president cannot create an alternative immigration system that bypasses laws enacted by Congress.</p>

          <p>Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne is set to perform his final show, reuniting with his original Black Sabbath bandmates for a farewell concert in his hometown of Birmingham. The 76-year-old frontman, whose career has been marked by both musical innovation and legendary debauchery, has faced numerous health issues, including Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. The event, titled "Back to the Beginning," will be held at Villa Park and feature performances by bands influenced by Sabbath. Despite previous retirement teases, this concert is widely seen as the definitive swansong for the "Prince of Darkness."</p>

          <p>The South American trade bloc Mercosur and the four-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have finalized a free trade agreement after a decade of negotiations. The deal, announced at a summit in Buenos Aires, aims to create a trade area covering nearly 300 million people by eliminating most customs duties. The EFTA bloc consists of non-EU members Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland. This agreement follows a similar, but still unratified, deal between Mercosur and the European Union, which has faced opposition from some EU nations over agricultural competition concerns.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers will have three players in the National League's starting lineup for the 2025 MLB All-Star Game: designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, catcher Will Smith, and first baseman Freddie Freeman. Despite having a record eight finalists, the team fell short of matching the all-time mark of five starters from a single club. The other five Dodgers finalists, including Mookie Betts and Max Muncy, were not selected by fans in the final phase of voting.

          <p>Switzerland, the host nation for the Women's Euro 2025 soccer tournament, lost its opening match 2-1 to Norway in a sold-out stadium in Basel. Despite taking an early lead, the Swiss team conceded two goals in the second half, including an unfortunate own goal, becoming the first host to lose their opening game. Coach Pia Sundhage remains optimistic about advancing to the quarter-finals, urging her team to focus on upcoming matches.

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted the recent airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have been invited by President Trump to the White House for the July Fourth holiday. However, they are expected to maintain a low profile, with their identities remaining undisclosed for security reasons. The invitation follows a public dispute over the effectiveness of the bombing mission, with Trump insisting the sites were "obliterated" and criticizing news reports that cited a more modest initial intelligence assessment. The White House celebration is also slated to include flyovers by B-2, F-22, and F-35 aircraft.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have struck a new trade agreement, establishing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports and averting a much higher 46% levy that was set to take effect. As part of the deal, President Trump announced that Vietnam will grant U.S. products tariff-free access to its markets. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a practice the administration claims is used to circumvent tariffs on Chinese products. The deal comes as many other US trading partners are still negotiating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer identified two major stories influencing current market behavior: developments in global trade and the weakening U.S. dollar. He pointed to the new trade deal between the U.S. and Vietnam, which established a lower-than-expected tariff, causing stocks like Nike and Williams-Sonoma to rise. Cramer also noted that the U.S. dollar's decline to a four-year low is a positive trend for American consumer packaged goods companies. He explained that a weaker dollar makes their exported products more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new essay, adapted from a book on the film "La Bamba," reflects on the lasting impact of Ritchie Valens, who died in a 1959 plane crash at age 17. It highlights how Valens transformed traditional sounds, like the Mexican folk song "La Bamba," into rock and roll anthems, pioneering a new Chicano sound. The article also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic, noting how the re-recorded soundtrack by Los Lobos introduced his music to a new generation. The author argues that Valens set the stage for the global success of Latin music.</p>
