Farage emphasized that these measures are intended to support lower-paid workers and families, rather than promoting a "benefits culture." The party also aims to raise the income tax threshold to ¬£20,000, funding these initiatives by scrapping net-zero climate measures and cutting public sector diversity initiatives. However, Stuart Adam, a senior economist, raised concerns about the feasibility of funding these expensive proposals. </p>
