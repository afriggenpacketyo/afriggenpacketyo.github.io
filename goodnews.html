          <p>Harvard's Kenneth Rogoff and Yu Yongding, formerly an advisor to China's central bank, discuss the US dollar's future and the potential of the Chinese yuan. Yu Yongding asserts that foreign investors' demand for US assets, particularly Treasury bonds, will gradually decline, making it increasingly difficult for the US to sustain its balance of payments and maintain a strong dollar. Rogoff has previously warned of a crisis of legitimacy for the US dollar, while Yu advocates for a free-floating yuan and broad fiscal stimulus in China. This discussion highlights the shifting dynamics in the global financial hierarchy and the potential challenges to the dollar's dominance (not investment advice).</p>
