          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate reduction, a rare occurrence that signals broadening support for looser policy. Policymakers cited concerns about inflation remaining above their target and the unpredictable effects of new tariffs, even as recent data showed moderate economic growth.</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered widespread alerts, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are generated. Key factors include an earthquake's magnitude, its location underwater, and the vertical movement of the seafloor which displaces massive volumes of water. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use deep-ocean pressure sensors to improve predictions, and safety officials stress the importance of heeding evacuation warnings and moving to higher ground immediately.</p>

Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed dense communities of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the Earth's crust, providing new insights into chemosynthetic life forms.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex and often contradictory research on how screen time affects child development, challenging the widely held belief that it is inherently harmful. Some academics argue that concrete scientific evidence for negative outcomes is lacking and that much of the data relies on flawed self-reporting. Conversely, other researchers point to correlations between rising social media use and teen depression, advocating for parents to delay smartphone access, which has left the scientific community divided.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. While initial warnings prompted evacuations in some areas, the threat to the U.S. was later downgraded, with Hawaii experiencing only minor flooding and small waves. However, advisories and evacuation orders remained in effect for parts of Japan and several South American countries, as powerful, long-period waves continued to travel across the ocean.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 quake off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly minimal tsunami damage in most areas. Scientists explain that the tsunami's primary energy was directed into a largely empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with the quake's specific characteristics, meant that areas like California and Hawaii were spared the catastrophic waves seen in past events.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the era of "comfort TV" may be waning, as evidenced by the popularity of anxiety-inducing shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt." These series use hyperrealistic techniques, such as single-take sequences and real-time narratives, to immerse viewers in high-pressure environments that mirror the stresses of modern life. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be cathartic for audiences, who relate to the characters' struggles for excellence in chaotic workplaces.</p>
