          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's policy of only allowing two gender options on U.S. passports. The policy, which eliminated the "X" designation and suspended a policy allowing individuals to identify as the opposite sex or as intersex or nonbinary, was deemed discriminatory. The judge stated that the policy is rooted in prejudice towards transgender Americans and would cause them psychological distress and fear for their safety.

The article suggests that European governments should leverage NATO's infrastructure to prepare for a future where they may need to act without US support.

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in UK waters as species shift habitats in response to rising ocean temperatures. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, noting that the North Sea could become a biodiversity hotspot. The analysis aims to guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as they change habitat.</p>

          <p>The G7 summit in Canada, hosted by Mark Carney, was overshadowed by the conflict between Israel and Iran and President Trump's early departure. Despite these disruptions, the summit addressed issues such as trade, Ukraine, and climate change. Leaders discussed potential trade deals, including a Canada-US agreement, and expressed support for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine. The summit also highlighted the challenges of balancing competing interests and maintaining unity among member nations.</p>

          <h2>Australia Removes Plasma Donation Restrictions for Gay and Bisexual Men</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 21:34:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has lifted blood and plasma donation restrictions for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. The new rules allow most people in a sexual relationship of 6 months or more with a single partner to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality. Lifeblood hopes the changes will provide a much-needed boost to supplies.</p>
