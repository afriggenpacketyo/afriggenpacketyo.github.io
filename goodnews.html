          <p>Southern California Edison has announced it will create a compensation program to directly pay victims of the deadly Eaton fire for their losses, a move aimed at avoiding protracted legal battles. The fire, which killed 19 people and destroyed over 9,400 structures, is suspected to have been caused by Edison's equipment, though the official investigation is ongoing. The utility has hired the consultants who managed the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to design the program, which will be open to those who lost property, were injured, or lost family members.</p>

          <h2>New Analysis Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Can Significantly Reduce Health Risks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new large-scale analysis published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with major health benefits, challenging the more commonly cited 10,000-step goal. The research, which reviewed dozens of studies, found that a 7,000-step count was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and significant reductions in the risk of dementia, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The authors propose that 7,000 steps could be a more realistic and achievable public health target for many individuals.</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded overall revenue and earnings projections, with total revenue growing nearly 8% year-over-year. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading as its software revenue of $7.39 billion slightly missed analyst expectations. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware and that geopolitical tensions prompted cautious behavior from a few clients. Despite the software miss, IBM's consulting and infrastructure segments performed strongly, and the company maintained its full-year guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates, with net income declining 42% from the previous year.

The company is currently overhauling its business model, moving away from open seating and introducing assigned seats, and noted that initial sales of its new restrictive basic economy fares had a temporary negative impact on revenue.

          <p>Australia has lifted strict, long-standing biosecurity restrictions on beef imports from the United States, a move that follows an extensive scientific and risk review. The curbs were first imposed in 2003 after the detection of mad cow disease in the U.S. This decision is seen as a significant step that could ease trade tensions, potentially helping Australia in its negotiations with the Trump administration to remove tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports. The U.S. has recently improved its cattle tracking systems, satisfying Australian biosecurity concerns.</p>

          <p>China is planning to build a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, which is projected to be the world's largest, producing three times the electricity of the Three Gorges Dam. While intended to meet local demand, its primary purpose is to export power, which could significantly boost China's geopolitical influence in South Asia. Observers suggest that by providing electricity to power-strapped countries like Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, the project could become a major strategic tool, strengthening Beijing's sway in a region where it competes with India for influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report delves into the history of the word "OK," one of the most universally recognized terms on the planet. Scholars trace its origin to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston, where it first appeared in print as a playful, misspelled abbreviation for "oll korrect" (all correct). The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently matched the initials. Its simplicity and versatility allowed it to thrive in the telegraph age and spread globally with American influence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on profits from home sales, a move aimed at stimulating the housing market. Currently, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for joint filers are subject to this tax, impacting a significant number of homeowners in high-value areas. The proposal, which follows the introduction of a similar bill in the House, could unlock equity for long-term homeowners but faces questions about its potential cost and broad congressional support.

          <p>Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have joined Democrats in backing a bill to shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The proposed CANADA Act would exempt small businesses from the duties as Trump threatens to impose a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods. The senators argue that the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade, drive up costs, and threaten jobs in their states. The legislation sends a message to the administration about the negative impacts of the trade dispute.</p>
