          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being transformed into a space for healing, art, and reparative history through collaboration between 1504, a narrative studio, and the Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation. The initiative aims to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities through creative storytelling, inviting people to feel the weight of the past. The project includes a site-specific sculpture memorializing "hush harbors," places where enslaved people worshiped and resisted, and dialogues between descendants of enslavers and the enslaved. The exhibit "Out of Whole Cloth" tells the stories of three families of free people in post-Emancipation Alabama. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, arguing the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage. The lawsuit was filed by Democratic state attorneys general who argued the policy was an attempt to coerce them into adhering to Trump‚Äôs immigration agenda. The states contended that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose such conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. </p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution. Local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 have reduced the share of waste consisting of plastic bags collected during shoreline cleanups by as much as 47%. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full bans, while partial bans were the least effective. California's statewide ban, which initially reduced plastic bag litter, led to an increase in waste due to a loophole allowing thicker plastic bags. </p>
