        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and giving them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrated that tellurium nanowire implants can convert light signals into electrical signals, bypassing damaged photoreceptor cells. This advance holds promise for treating human blindness and potentially enhancing vision beyond normal capabilities. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, making it suitable for this application.</p>

The TSA clarified the issue in a humorous social media post, emphasizing that Costco cards do not meet the requirements for REAL ID compliance.

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, addressing China's demographic challenges. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce, making the need to boost birth rates increasingly urgent. Traditional expectations placing the burden of childcare on women persist in China, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>Japan and the European Union are preparing to launch an "alliance" framework to beef up their companies' competitiveness by promoting trade and economic security cooperation, diplomatic sources said Saturday, facing concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and Chinese trade practices. The creation of the "Japan-EU Competitiveness Alliance" is expected to be announced at a regular summit meeting being arranged for July, when Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is likely to host European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, they said.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty won the 157th Belmont Stakes in Saratoga Springs, New York, defeating Journalism in a rematch of the Kentucky Derby. This victory marks Sovereignty as the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont. The race was held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the distance to 1 1/4 miles. Jockey Junior Alvarado, who also rode Sovereignty to victory at the Derby, was his mount on Saturday.</p>
