          <p>Saudi Arabia, through its Public Investment Fund-owned company Humain, is aggressively pursuing a strategy to become the world's third-largest artificial intelligence provider, following the United States and China. The kingdom plans to leverage its abundant land and energy resources to build extensive data center capacity, aiming for 1.9 gigawatts by 2030 and six gigawatts by 2034. This initiative, launched in May, seeks to diversify the economy away from oil, with Humain focusing on full-stack AI capabilities, strategic technology partnerships, and significant investments in companies like Groq, AMD, and Nvidia. The ambitious plan faces competition from the UAE and questions regarding the environmental impact and ability to attract AI talent.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle rose by approximately 5% following the announcement of a limited-edition collaboration between the apparel company and football star Travis Kelce. This partnership, featuring Kelce's sportswear brand Tru Kolors with vintage-inspired T-shirts and varsity jackets, was strategically revealed just a day after his highly publicized engagement to Taylor Swift. The timing capitalized on significant public attention, mirroring previous celebrity collaborations that have influenced stock performance, such as the one with Sydney Sweeney. This strategic marketing move aims to boost American Eagle's sales and brand visibility, leveraging Kelce's current pop culture prominence and the associated media buzz to attract consumers.</p>

          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley has announced his six wildcard picks for the upcoming tournament, selecting Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Patrick Cantlay, and Sam Burns. Bradley, despite being ranked 11th in the world, made the significant decision not to become the first playing captain since 1963, emphasizing that he had decided "a while ago" not to play. This completes the US team, which will seek to win back the trophy they lost in the previous edition when they face Europe from September 26-28. Notable absentees include Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka, underscoring the competitive nature of the selections and the challenges of forming a winning team.</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite a decline in overall sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range, now expecting a 5% to 6% decline, and revised its earnings per share guidance upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged economic pressures but highlighted initiatives like reintroducing petite sections, adding jewelry, and expanding lower-priced exclusive brands to drive future growth. These positive results, including improved sales trends in July and reduced inventory, offer a crucial boost for the struggling department store amidst its ongoing turnaround efforts and leadership changes.

          <p>The David Frum Show features a discussion with leading classicist Mary Beard on the misuse of history in contemporary politics, particularly the polemical comparisons to ancient Rome. Frum argues that modern fascism, thriving on culture wars and the hunt for enemies, has reemerged, using new technologies and rejecting formal democratic processes. Beard emphasizes that while historical comparisons are tempting, they often oversimplify complex realities, noting Rome's vast knowledge deficit compared to modern states. The conversation explores the differences between the Roman Republic and Empire, the fluidity of "barbarian" identities, and the economic myths surrounding Roman trade, advocating for a nuanced understanding of history to address modern challenges.</p>

          <p>US retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are employing distinct "front-loading" and supply chain diversification strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Abercrombie, with a diverse supply chain, has shifted global production and managed expenses, while Best Buy front-loaded freight but is less reliant on China. Discount retailer Five Below, heavily exposed to Chinese tariffs, leverages inventory flexibility and opportunistic purchasing. Industry experts note that tariff impacts will vary, with large-scale food/consumable retailers better positioned to absorb costs, while general merchandise retailers may face greater challenges, ultimately affecting consumer prices.

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a locked guesthouse room in Sichuan province. Realizing the door's malfunction and lacking her phone, she bit her finger and used her blood to write "110 625" (the emergency number and her room number) on a pillow. She then bravely threw the pillow from the sixth-floor window. A vigilant food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the unusual distress call and immediately alerted the police, leading to her successful rescue. Zhang was subsequently awarded 3,000 yuan ($419) by local authorities for his quick-thinking and life-saving intervention, underscoring the power of community awareness.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unearthed a bizarre armored dinosaur, Spicomellus afer, in Morocco, distinguished by metre-long spikes fused directly onto its neck bones, earning it the nickname "punk rocker." Living 165 million years ago, this species is the oldest known ankylosaur, a group of armored dinosaurs, and its elaborate spikiness is forcing experts to rethink the evolution of these creatures. Previously, it was thought ankylosaurs developed simple armor that became more complex over time to fend off predators like T-Rex. This discovery suggests early ankylosaurs might have used their elaborate structures for display, later co-opting them for defense.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand in the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5% and comparable sales dropping 11%. However, the company's overall performance was significantly bolstered by a strong 19% growth from its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. Abercrombie & Fitch narrowly beat Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, but tightened its earnings forecast due to a nearly doubled $90 million in net tariff costs. The company is not planning broad price increases, instead relying on new categories, international expansion, and strategic partnerships like the NFL deal to drive future growth.

This surge indicates a strategic refocusing of Chinese capital, with funding notably diminishing in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East. Kazakhstan emerged as the primary destination for this investment, securing $23 billion, including a massive $12 billion aluminum complex.

          <p>A landmark federal court ruling on Google's default search contracts, potentially costing the company over $26 billion annually (with $20 billion going to Apple), is imminent. While this could impact Google's search traffic, analysts suggest Apple faces a larger financial hit. Paradoxically, some economists believe Google might benefit long-term by being freed from these costly deals, allowing it to redirect resources towards artificial intelligence and cloud services, particularly its Gemini platform. This antitrust case, which found Google holds a search monopoly, aims to foster competition, but Google's dominance remains strong, even in markets where default choices were mandated.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed deep regret, acknowledging this and "other dark chapters" of systematic discrimination. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also apologized, as approximately 150 affected women are currently suing Denmark for compensation.
