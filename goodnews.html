          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise. Yusuf, a wealthy businessman, provided financial support and helped broaden the party's appeal by being a minority-ethnic figurehead. He also contributed to building the party's infrastructure. His departure highlights the challenge Reform UK faces in hiring and retaining staff to build a sustainable political organization. The party's history of internal conflicts suggests this will be a difficult task, requiring more than just Nigel Farage's leadership.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a surge of cheap exports, causing concern among Asian economies about potential harm to local industries. However, this influx of low-cost goods could provide relief to inflation-burdened economies, potentially easing the cost-of-living crisis for consumers. Economists suggest that this could allow central banks to consider further rate cuts to stimulate growth. Despite potential trade tensions, the situation presents a silver lining for economies seeking to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered 150 years after his birth as a significant voice for democracy.

          <p>India's central bank has implemented a larger-than-expected interest rate cut, lowering the benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This move, the third consecutive rate cut since February, aims to address softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth amid global uncertainty. The decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, but the central bank maintains its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral," signaling limited room for further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

The report analyzed millions of job ads and company financial reports, revealing that productivity growth is higher in AI-exposed industries.

The study suggests that AI enriches automatable jobs by allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks, ultimately making them more valuable.</p>
