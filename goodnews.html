          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited six Western Balkan nations to discuss their potential EU membership, economic growth, and necessary political reforms. During her trip, she praised Montenegro as a "frontrunner" for accession while urging Serbia to align with EU sanctions against Russia and improve its record on the rule of law and media freedom. The visit highlights the EU's geopolitical interest in stabilizing the region and countering Russian influence, though von der Leyen emphasized that accession criteria will not be lowered for candidate countries.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced plans to soon advance a bill imposing new economic sanctions on Russia, stating that "the time has come" for a vote. The legislation, which has strong bipartisan support with 85 co-sponsors, aims to increase pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. The bill's progress had previously been stalled due to other foreign policy priorities and White House concerns over implementation details. The renewed push follows a recent phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, with lawmakers aiming to send a clear message to the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for 30-year mortgages have fallen to their lowest level in a month, averaging 6.27%, creating a more favorable market for prospective homebuyers. However, this article advises buyers to act strategically, recommending they secure a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen their offers and begin their home search promptly. It also cautions against assuming rates will continue to fall, as market conditions can shift unexpectedly, and warns that the traditional spring buying season may start early due to pent-up demand. Buyers should be prepared for increased competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's latest film, "It Was Just an Accident," which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, is an incisive thriller that questions the nature of revenge and memory. The story follows a group of former political prisoners who kidnap a man they believe was their torturer, identified only by the distinctive squeak of his prosthetic leg. As they debate whether to execute him, their uncertainty and trauma come to the forefront, turning the film into a powerful meditation on how citizens can move on from state-sanctioned cruelty. The film deftly blends genres to explore the lingering effects of oppression.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued its winter outlook for 2025-2026, forecasting warmer-than-average temperatures for most of the contiguous United States.

The forecast covers the months of December, January, and February but does not offer specific predictions for snowfall amounts.</p>

          <p>The J. M. Smucker Company has filed a federal lawsuit against Trader Joe's, accusing the grocery chain of trademark infringement over its crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Smucker's alleges that Trader Joe's product is too similar in its round, disc-like shape and crimped edges to its own popular "Uncrustables" brand. The lawsuit claims that Smucker's has invested heavily in marketing the unique design of its product, which is protected by trademarks. The company is seeking damages and a court order to halt the sale of the Trader Joe's version.</p>

          <p>UCLA's offense has seen a dramatic turnaround since tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel was promoted to play-caller and brought in his former mentor, Noel Mazzone, as an advisor. After an 0-4 start, the Bruins have won two straight games, with their scoring average nearly tripling. The partnership reverses their previous roles, when Neuheisel was a backup quarterback under Mazzone, then UCLA's offensive coordinator. Their reunion has injected new energy and strategic clarity into the team, with observers noting a return to the successful space-and-matchup offensive philosophy that Mazzone implemented in his first tenure.</p>
