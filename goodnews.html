          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill that would provide a tax break on tip income for workers, with both President Trump and Vice President Harris supporting the measure. If enacted, workers could deduct all 'qualified tips' from 2025 through 2028, but the bill's benefits would largely accrue to moderate to middle-income workers, with limited impact on part-time employees or the lowest-income tipped workers. Experts raise concerns about potential issues, including the misclassification of income as tips and shifts in compensation structures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is directing Pfizer and Moderna to broaden the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines regarding the risk of heart injury side effects, particularly in young males aged 16 to 25. The new warnings, prompted by data from the agency's safety surveillance system and published research, indicate a higher incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in this age group. The FDA emphasizes that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risks, while also providing radical transparency.</p>
