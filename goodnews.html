          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to provide customers with clearer information about ticket prices. The probe was initiated after complaints regarding the pricing for Oasis's reunion tour, where the company was found to have potentially misled fans about expensive "platinum" tickets that offered no extra benefits. Under the new agreement, Ticketmaster will give 24 hours' notice if tiered pricing is used and offer more detailed price information to customers waiting in online queues.</p>

Her body was found beside a road in Barcelona province under suspicious circumstances, with evidence suggesting it had been moved.
