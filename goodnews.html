          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:06:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, a tsunami warning for Hawaii was downgraded to an advisory and later lifted. The event prompted evacuations and shelter openings, but the resulting waves were relatively small, causing minor shoreline flooding without substantial damage. Alerts were also issued for the U.S. West Coast and other Pacific nations, but the widespread, catastrophic impact that was initially feared did not materialize. Officials confirmed that wave heights had peaked and the immediate threat had subsided.</p>

          <h2>New Report Finds Cases of Noncitizen Voting in US Elections Are Exceedingly Rare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread political claims about noncitizens influencing U.S. elections, a new comprehensive report confirms such instances are extremely rare and not part of any coordinated effort. The research, conducted by the Center for Election Innovation & Research, reviewed state-level data and found that official investigations consistently uncover only a minuscule number of cases. Election experts note that safeguards and the severe legal consequences, including deportation, serve as powerful deterrents. The report concludes that allegations of widespread noncitizen voting often stem from misunderstandings or political fabrications.</p>

          <h2>Research Reveals Great Tit Songbirds Engage in 'Divorce' Behavior</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study on Great Tits, a common European songbird, has found that some mated pairs effectively "divorce" at the end of a breeding season. Using radio tags to track their social interactions, researchers at the University of Oxford observed that while many pairs remained together through the winter, others gradually drifted apart. These "divorcing" birds associated with each other less and less over time, suggesting they were forming new social bonds ahead of the next breeding season. The findings underscore the complex and significant role of social relationships in the animal kingdom.</p>

          <p>The term "dude" has a rich history that traces back to the 1880s in New York City, where it was used to describe overly fashionable, effeminate young men. The word likely referenced "Yankee Doodle" and was popularized by a poem meant to mock the trend. It later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting western "dude ranches" in elaborate cowboy attire. By the mid-20th century, the term was adopted by Black and Mexican American communities as a marker of solidarity before entering mainstream surfer and skater culture, eventually becoming a widely used, gender-neutral term of familiarity.</p>

          <p>Colombian winger Luis Diaz has completed a transfer from Liverpool to German champions Bayern Munich for a reported fee of £65.5 million. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract, ending his tenure at Anfield where he won four major trophies, including the Premier League. In a farewell message, Diaz stated he was leaving with a sense of "duty fulfilled" and paid tribute to his late teammate Diogo Jota. Diaz was a key player for Liverpool, known for his dribbling and goal-scoring, and his departure will create a void on the team's left flank.</p>

          <p>After days of deadly border clashes, Thailand and Cambodia have reaffirmed their commitment to a ceasefire, a move that followed a China-brokered meeting in Shanghai. The initial ceasefire agreement had been shaky, with both sides accusing the other of violations. However, the diplomatic intervention from China, which positioned itself as a constructive mediator, appears to have stabilized the situation. The conflict had killed at least 41 people and displaced over 260,000, but there are now signs of calm returning to the border region.</p>

          <p>Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice for artificial intelligence, highlighting a significant split with Meta, which has refused to endorse the guidelines. While Google expressed hope that signing would promote access to AI tools, it also voiced concerns that the EU's approach could slow innovation and harm Europe's competitiveness. Meta previously called the code an overreach that would "stunt" the industry. The guidelines are designed to help companies comply with the landmark EU AI Act on issues of transparency, safety, and security.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has publicly backed new head coach Ruben Amorim's strict approach to transforming the club's culture, which he described as having been "toxic" and "unhealthy." Shaw stated that Amorim demands 100% effort and will not hesitate to sideline any player, regardless of their status, who fails to meet his standards. This comes after a disappointing season and the exclusion of five senior players from the squad. Shaw emphasized that the senior players must reinforce this new mentality to restore a positive and winning environment at the club.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. The slowdown brings inflation almost to the bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range, strengthening the case for an interest rate cut at its next meeting. The RBA has already cut rates twice this year but held them steady in its last meeting to confirm the downward trend. Analysts now believe this new data provides sufficient evidence for the bank to proceed with another cut to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The bank also confirmed it is on track with its integration of Credit Suisse and will continue its share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>
