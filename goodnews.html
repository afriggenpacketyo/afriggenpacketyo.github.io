        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest three potential scenarios for gold prices in June 2025, including stabilization, a drop, or a rebound, contingent on factors like Federal Reserve policy, geopolitical conditions, and economic data. Gold prices could stabilize if the Fed holds rates steady and no major changes occur in global conditions. Conversely, prices might drop if the Fed raises rates or trade wars are resolved, prompting capital to flow from gold to treasuries. A rebound could occur if economic data weakens, leading the Fed to lower rates and spurring gold demand. (not investment advice) The author's tone is cautiously optimistic, highlighting the potential for both positive and negative influences on gold prices.</p>
