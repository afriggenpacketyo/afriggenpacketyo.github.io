The defense budget is set to more than double by 2029, reaching 3.5% of GDP, driven by growing security concerns and pressure from the U.S. for increased military spending.

          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only play a limited role in the future financial system due to lacking key characteristics of traditional currencies. The BIS suggests that stablecoins rely on pseudonymity, making them susceptible to illicit use. Instead, the BIS proposes a unified platform for tokenized central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds to form the basis of the next-generation monetary and financial system. This warning comes as major economies consider adopting stablecoins to further globalize their currencies.</p>

          <p>Mark Walter's acquisition of the Lakers raises questions about the future of broadcasting for both the Lakers and Dodgers. While the possibility of a joint Dodgers-Lakers channel exists, it appears unlikely in the short term due to existing lucrative deals with Charter Communications. The long-term solution might involve exploring league-wide streaming packages, allowing both teams to capitalize on the changing media landscape. Walter's expanded portfolio, including the Sparks, could lead to further consolidation and strategic partnerships in the sports and entertainment industry.</p>
