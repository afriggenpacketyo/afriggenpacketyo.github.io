          <p>A London court has affirmed a 2020 law in the Cayman Islands that provides legal recognition for same-sex civil partnerships. The ruling by the privy council, the final court of appeal for the British overseas territory, rejected a challenge arguing the governor overstepped his authority by enacting the law after the local parliament voted it down. This decision is seen by advocates as a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights and could set a precedent for other British overseas territories. The case originated from a lawsuit by a lesbian couple who were denied the right to marry.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is accelerating its plan to move washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, an investment of $490 million. This move, which will create 800 new U.S. jobs, is primarily driven by a desire to avoid high tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by the Trump administration. The company stated that while its long-term strategy involves manufacturing products closer to where they are sold, the current tariff environment made the decision more urgent. The new Kentucky facility is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will close. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system is being analyzed for its potential to deter threats from China in the Indo-Pacific. The concept, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, aims to create a shield to protect the U.S. from long-range missiles using a network of satellites and space-based sensors. While proponents believe it could enhance U.S. security and deter military actions near regions like the Taiwan Strait, significant questions remain. Analysts are scrutinizing the project's feasibility, technological challenges, and multibillion-dollar cost as the U.S. seeks to maintain a military edge over China.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a surge in inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory before the tariffs took effect. Companies have also been absorbing some of the costs to avoid alienating consumers and have utilized legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts warn that these are temporary measures and that consumers will likely see higher prices in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

This move marks the company's first venture into making private equity accessible on the blockchain and is part of a broader expansion of its cryptocurrency services in Europe. Due to the EU's more flexible regulatory environment, which lacks accredited investor rules, a wider range of investors can access these assets. The company is promoting the launch by giving away tokens, but a similar offering is not expected in the U.S. soon due to regulatory hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to ease some U.S. financial sanctions against Syria, a move the White House says is intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The order cancels a 2004 declaration that froze Syrian government assets but keeps other sanctions in place, including those targeting the former Assad regime. The action follows a meeting between Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that sanctions were hindering his transitional government's ability to function. The order directs a review of remaining sanctions and could provide leverage in normalizing regional relations.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied for a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, Circle would become one of the few crypto-native firms to receive such a federal license, allowing it to establish the First National Digital Currency Bank. This move aligns with the company's goal of integrating stablecoins into the traditional financial system and would help it comply with emerging U.S. regulations.

The plan, intended to create land for affordable housing, faced bipartisan opposition from lawmakers in other Western states who feared losing public access. Lee stated he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign interests or large corporations.

          <p>As part of a cost-saving initiative, Buckingham Palace has announced that the royal train will be taken out of service by 2027. The decision was revealed in the annual royal finances report, which highlighted the high cost of the train, including a single two-day trip that cost over ¬£44,000. The tradition of a dedicated train for the monarch dates back to Queen Victoria, but its infrequent use has raised questions about its value for money. The Royal Family will continue to use regular train services and helicopters for travel. Before its decommissioning, the train will take a final tour around the UK.</p>

This article calculates the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit in both, finding the results to be very close. For example, a 6-month CD at 4.49% would yield slightly more than a money market account at 4.40%. The key difference is that CD rates are fixed, guaranteeing a return, while money market rates are variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as expected later this year.
