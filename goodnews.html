        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Country singer Luke Bryan has strongly condemned the practice of throwing objects at artists during performances, calling the perpetrators "idiots" and describing it as a "deterioration of the moral fabric." His comments follow an incident at the North Dakota State Fair where he was hit in the face with a small beach ball-like object while on stage. Bryan explained that while this particular object was not dangerous, the trend is frustrating and causes unnecessary concern among his family and friends. He also recalled fans throwing expensive cell phones on stage, viewing it as a sign of entitlement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Widespread online rumors claiming that the U.S. government is distributing new stimulus checks to taxpayers are false, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Congress has not passed any legislation authorizing such payments, and no new economic impact payments are scheduled for distribution. The confusion may stem from a separate, expired deadline for claiming a 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit or a proposed bill by Senator Josh Hawley, which has not passed. The IRS has clarified that past stimulus payments were authorized by specific acts of Congress in response to economic crises, and no such authorization is currently in place.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is reviewed as a worthy modern Western that explores the lives of a struggling ranch matriarch and her rodeo-star daughter in South Dakota. Directed by Kate Beecroft, the movie employs a docu-fiction approach, casting first-time actors to play versions of themselves in a story drawn from their own experiences with horses, family, and financial hardship. While the review notes that the film doesn't achieve the seamless transcendence of similar works like "The Rider," it praises the authentic portrayal of resilience and the compelling performances of its real-life subjects, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Finds Trump's Claims of 'Out of Control' Crime in Washington D.C. are Misleading</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 13:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of crime statistics reveals that President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force is based on misleading claims. While D.C. did have a high murder rate in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024. According to the city's Metropolitan Police Department, violent crime has seen a 26% reduction this year compared to the same period in 2024, continuing a downward trend. This data contradicts the administration's narrative of a current, escalating crisis and aligns with a broader national trend of decreasing crime rates reported by the FBI.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such an intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument posits that government support is necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The potential deal, which could utilize funds from the CHIPS Act, aims to bolster domestic high-end technology production. The move is framed as a strategic necessity to ensure the U.S. maintains control over critical technology, especially in light of the rise of superintelligent AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are prioritizing the repayment of credit card debt, which collectively stands at $1.21 trillion amid high interest rates. However, with about 45% of adults carrying balances on multiple cards, managing payments can be complex. The article outlines several strategies for tackling this debt, including debt management plans through credit counseling agencies, which can lower interest rates and consolidate payments. Other options discussed include debt settlement, issuer hardship programs, and debt consolidation loans, all aimed at simplifying repayment and reducing the overall financial burden for consumers.</p>

For Meta, potential buy levels are cited around $738, $722, and a more significant drop to $638. For Microsoft, suggested entry points are around $502, $455, and $438.

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It explores Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her focus on the moral education of young people under the influence of a charismatic, god-like teacher. The story centers on the recollections of Brodie's students, especially Sandy, whose journey into adulthood and conversion to Catholicism is framed as a way of dethroning her former mentor. The analysis highlights Spark's realistic portrayal of how influential figures can leave an indelible mark on a person's life, even long after their direct influence has waned.</p>

The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the Premier League champions until 2031. Leoni, who only made his senior debut in 2023, is seen as a strategic signing to provide defensive cover and build for the future, especially with captain Virgil van Dijk now 34. Despite his limited top-flight experience, Leoni's impressive aerial ability and composure in possession attracted interest from several top clubs before he opted for the move to Liverpool.</p>

The news, combined with disclosures of new stakes by investors Michael Burry and David Tepper, has provided a significant boost to the company's stock.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, centered in the Geysers geothermal steam field. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 4.0, but such events are common in this volcanically active area, home to a major geothermal power facility. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, these minor quakes are often induced by the power generation process itself. This involves the withdrawal of steam and the injection of reclaimed cold water, which can cause the surrounding rock to contract and shift, triggering small seismic events that are not related to major fault lines like the San Andreas.</p>
