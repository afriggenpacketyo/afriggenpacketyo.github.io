          <p>President Trump celebrated the NATO allies' commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, calling it "The Hague Defense Commitment" and a "monumental win" for the United States. Trump stated that this agreement would add over $1 trillion a year toward common defense, alleviating the financial burden on the United States. He framed this as a victory for Europe and Western civilization, emphasizing the importance of shared responsibility in defense spending. This commitment reflects Trump's long-standing push for NATO allies to contribute more to their own defense. </p>

          <p>President Trump refuted an early Pentagon report suggesting that joint U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities only set back the program by months, asserting that the facilities were "totally obliterated." Trump cited additional intelligence and reports from Israeli and Iranian sources to support his claim, emphasizing the severity of the damage. He dismissed the need for further negotiations with Iran, stating that the "war is done" and he does not foresee Iran resuming nuclear activities. The president also likened the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II, expressing optimism about future U.S.-Iran relations and noting Iran's agreement to a ceasefire. The article highlights the conflicting assessments and the political implications of the strikes. </p>

          <p>House Republicans, led by Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, are working to reinstate the National Coal Council, which was effectively disbanded during the Biden administration. Representatives Michael Rulli and Riley Moore are spearheading the effort to support the clean coal industry, citing energy security concerns amid Middle East instability. They argue that the Biden administration's actions against the council were a deliberate attempt to eliminate coal jobs and increase reliance on foreign energy. The revived council is intended to promote lower-emissions technology and support the increasing electricity demands of AI data centers, aligning with President Trump's focus on clean coal. </p>

While FedEx's stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to profit guidance that was slightly below Wall Street expectations, the company remains focused on its long-term cost-cutting initiatives.

          <p>The UK government plans to acquire at least 12 new US-made F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that this procurement responds to a growing nuclear threat. The new jets can carry conventional weapons but can also be equipped with US-made nuclear bombs, requiring authorization from NATO's nuclear planning group, the US president, and the British prime minister for their use. The decision follows a Strategic Defence Review and aims to strengthen the UK's nuclear posture. </p>
