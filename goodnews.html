          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton shared his struggles with anxiety and self-doubt after facing injuries and negative social media comments. Haliburton's openness highlights the mental health challenges faced by athletes, as further supported by a study at Bundesliga club Hoffenheim, which found that a significant percentage of players experienced depressive and anxiety symptoms during the season. The study also indicated that female players reported higher depression scores than male players, potentially due to lower levels of professionalism and support in women's football. Haliburton's ability to turn things around after his struggles emphasizes the importance of addressing mental health in sports. (optimism_score: 60)</p>
