          <p>Eliana Pinckney, daughter of Reverend Clementa Pinckney who was killed in the Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting ten years ago, shared her reflections on the tragedy and its impact on her life. Despite the pain, Pinckney, now a professional actress, focuses on putting good into the world and wishes for growth for the shooter, Dylan Roof, rather than harboring hatred. Other survivors and family members of victims have also spoken about forgiveness and healing in the years following the shooting, emphasizing the importance of finding peace and resilience. Pinckney is giving life lessons in resilience and forgiveness, both on and off the stage.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, according to Global Energy Monitor (GEM). This trend could help advance the clean energy transition while potentially reducing a surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. Ninety former coal mines in mainland China are now operating as solar-power facilities, with additional projects in the planning stages, and similar projects are being pursued in other countries as a way to address land-utilization issues and promote a just energy transition.</p>

          <p>Goliath, a Gal치pagos tortoise at Zoo Miami, celebrated his 135th birthday and first Father's Day after successfully mating with Sweet Pea, resulting in the first Gal치pagos tortoise hatchling born at the zoo. The hatchling is healthy and active, though it has limited interaction with its parents, as is typical in the wild. The zoo has submitted applications to Guinness World Records to recognize Goliath and Sweet Pea as the oldest first-time parents in history. The Philadelphia Zoo also recently welcomed four Gal치pagos tortoise hatchlings, marking a similar milestone for their nearly century-old parents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing a Trump administration executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity on passport applications, including selecting "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. This decision expands on a previous ruling and is based on the finding that the policy discriminates against transgender Americans and lacks a rationale related to an important governmental interest. The Justice Department has appealed the April ruling.</p>

          <p>Texas has stopped providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting course after completing only 65 miles of the planned barrier. Lawmakers approved a new budget that does not include continued funding for the wall, which had been a multibillion-dollar priority for Governor Greg Abbott. Abbott's office stated that President Trump's aggressive efforts to curb immigration allowed the state to adjust its border security efforts. The remaining funds will allow work on the wall to continue through 2026.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on the sidelines of a G7 summit to reset India-Canada relations after nearly two years of dispute. The dispute stemmed from New Delhi's alleged involvement in the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in Canada. Carney invited India to the summit due to its importance in global supply chains, and the leaders reaffirmed the importance of Canada-India ties based on mutual respect and sovereignty. Canada is home to the largest Sikh population outside of India, and this community expressed concerns about the invitation.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, is considered a milestone for the crypto industry and for President Trump's digital asset empire. It sets requirements for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, while granting authority to the Treasury Secretary. The bill now heads to the House, where it faces further hurdles and potential reconciliation with a similar bill.</p>

This decision follows similar announcements from other companies and comes amid growing concerns about the health effects of synthetic food dyes. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has laid out plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity among Americans. Earlier on Tuesday, Kraft Heinz said it would not launch products with artificial colors in the United States effective immediately, and would aim to eliminate synthetic dyes from existing items by the end of 2027.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming mayoral primary election, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the process continues in rounds until only two candidates remain. This system has led to unique alliances among candidates, including cross-endorsements, and aims to provide voters with more choices. Full results will not be reported until a week after the primary, on July 1, due to the complexity of tabulating the ranked-choice ballots.</p>
