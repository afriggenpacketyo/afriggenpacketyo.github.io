          <h2>Tesla Launches Model Y in India at a High Price Point Amid Steep Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. This premium pricing is a direct result of India's substantial import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle to compete with luxury brands like BMW rather than mass-market EVs. Analysts suggest this initial launch is a strategic move to "test the waters" and build a brand presence, rather than aiming for high sales volume immediately. The company's future pricing and manufacturing decisions in India will likely depend on potential changes to trade policies and the development of the local EV ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Veteran spinner Liam Dawson has been called up to the England cricket squad for the upcoming fourth Test against India, marking his potential return to Test cricket after an eight-year hiatus. The 35-year-old's inclusion comes after off-spinner Shoaib Bashir was ruled out for the remainder of the series due to a broken finger. Dawson's selection is a recognition of his exceptional domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. His recall sees him chosen over fellow left-armer Jack Leach, who holds a central contract with England.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Introduces Grants Up to £3,750 to Boost Electric Vehicle Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:36:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is rolling out a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars priced under £37,000. This initiative is part of a £650 million program aimed at helping the country meet its goal of banning new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030. While the government and some industry figures welcome the move to make EVs more affordable, critics argue it forces consumers toward a product they may not want. Concerns also persist about the adequacy of the UK's public charging infrastructure, which many see as a primary barrier to widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX capsule carrying the four-person crew of Axiom Space's fourth private mission has successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding a 20-day journey that included 18 days docked at the International Space Station. The mission was commanded by veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson, who extended her U.S. record for cumulative time in space. She was joined by national astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking a significant return to space for these nations. During their time on the ISS, the crew conducted approximately 60 scientific experiments, making it Axiom's most research-intensive private mission to date.</p>

          <p>CMBI, the brokerage subsidiary of China Merchants Bank, has been granted a virtual asset license by Hong Kong regulators, allowing it to offer services such as crypto trading, custody, and advisory. This move provides the firm with regulated entry into Hong Kong's expanding digital asset market, a key development as the city positions itself as a crypto hub. The licensing reflects a broader trend of mainland Chinese financial institutions with international operations seeking to engage with the growing global crypto industry. However, these operations must adhere to strict regulations that prevent direct participation from mainland China, where crypto activities are heavily restricted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a lighthearted interview, President Donald Trump suggested he could potentially issue an executive order to change the American term "soccer" to "football," aligning the U.S. with the terminology used in most of the world. The comments were made during an interview at the FIFA Club World Cup final, which was held in New Jersey. While it is unclear how serious the president was about the proposal, his presence at the final and his remarks indicate a growing interest in the sport. Trump appeared alongside the winning team, Chelsea, as they celebrated their victory over Paris St. Germain in the newly expanded tournament.</p>

          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson has signed a two-year deal with Premier League club Brentford, completing his return to English football after a brief stint with Ajax. The 35-year-old former Liverpool captain, who left the Dutch club by mutual consent, brings extensive experience, having won numerous major trophies during his 12 years at Liverpool. Brentford's manager highlighted Henderson's leadership qualities as a key reason for the signing, aiming to fill the experience void left by recent departures.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company has received a green light from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to China, reversing a previous ban. The decision comes after intense lobbying from tech leaders who argued that restrictions on sales to the world's largest tech market were hindering U.S. competitiveness. The prior ban was based on national security concerns that the chips could be used for military purposes. This policy shift is expected to significantly boost Nvidia's revenue and ease trade friction, though some analysts caution that Chinese firms will remain focused on domestic chip development due to policy unpredictability.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are a rapidly growing segment of the cryptocurrency market, attracting interest from major companies and prompting new legislation in the U.S. Congress. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value by being backed by reserves of a stable asset, typically the U.S. dollar. This stability makes them a potential tool for instantaneous, low-fee global money transfers, revolutionizing payments for businesses and consumers. However, critics raise concerns about the safety of reserves, their potential use in illicit activities, and the systemic risks they could pose to the broader financial system if not properly regulated.

          <p>In her new memoir, "The Dry Season," author Melissa Febos chronicles her decision to abstain from sex and dating for a year at age 35 to reset her life after a series of obsessive relationships.

Febos discovered she had more energy for her creative work, friendships, and political activism, and developed a deeper understanding of her own needs. She found that withdrawing from sex made other aspects of her life more sensual and ultimately enabled her to form the healthy, honest partnership she now has.</p>

          <p>After a slow start, England's Lionesses have secured a spot in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with strong performances, drawing comparisons to their victorious 2022 campaign. An analysis shows that while they have scored fewer goals overall, the scoring has been more distributed among players this year. The team has directed more of its attack down the right flank to leverage Lauren James's talent. Defensively, they have conceded more goals than in the entire 2022 tournament, largely due to a tough opening match against France. However, tactical changes and effective use of substitutes have helped the team regain its form, demonstrating their ability to grow into a tournament.</p>
