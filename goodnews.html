        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly pursuing an equity stake in Lithium Americas, a Canadian mining company, leading to a significant 100% surge in its stock. This proposed investment is linked to renegotiating a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a critical source of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The White House aims to mitigate taxpayer risk and strengthen the U.S. critical mineral supply chain, marking a continued effort to take direct ownership in vital resources. This potential deal, which could require Canadian approval, signifies a strategic move in securing future energy independence. (not investment advice)</p>

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that 1.6 million individuals voluntarily self-deported, while 400,000 were removed by federal law enforcement. This initiative, described as making American communities safe and ending open borders, includes ramping up deportation capacity with new detention facilities like Alligator Alcatraz.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell indicated the league might renegotiate its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. This accelerated timeline could add billions to the NFL's revenue, driven by the league's dominant TV viewership and recent lucrative deals secured by other sports leagues. While requiring agreement from current partners like Disney and Amazon, this move offers both stability for media companies and increased financial flexibility for the NFL, potentially impacting the salary cap and team valuations. Regulatory considerations, such as ESPN's pending deal, and a potential 18th regular-season week could influence the timing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft is diversifying its artificial intelligence strategy by integrating Anthropic's models into its Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant for commercial clients, moving beyond its primary reliance on OpenAI. This strategic step allows users in Microsoft's Frontier program to choose Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 for complex tasks like information gathering and report generation. The article highlights the increasingly complex and competitive AI landscape, with OpenAI also expanding its partnerships while Microsoft develops its own in-house AI, MAI-1-preview. This move signals a significant strategic shift as AI models become more commoditized and competition intensifies among tech giants.</p>

          <p>Avani Yaltho's podcast, "The Things We Buried," won NPR's Student Podcast Challenge for its moving exploration of a disappearing way of life in Kerala, India. Through intimate interviews with her grandparents, Avani contrasts their childhood memories of open communities and shared resources with the profound impact of urbanization and globalization on the region. The article highlights her evocative storytelling and the challenges of capturing the sounds of a bygone era, such as the absence of specific bird calls. It ultimately reflects on how some comforting traditions, like a curry leaf tree, can still take root and thrive in new environments.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that advanced artificial intelligence models can now pass Level III of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, a feat previously challenging due to its essay questions. Developed by researchers from NYU Stern School of Business and Goodfin, the study found frontier reasoning models like o4-mini and Claude Opus succeeded using "chain-of-thought prompting." While this marks a significant technological leap in specialized financial decision-making, experts believe AI will not entirely replace human CFAs due to the irreplaceable need for human context and intent assessment.

          <p>New home sales surged by an unexpected 20.5% in August compared to July, reaching the highest level since January 2022 and marking the largest one-month gain in three years. This significant jump occurred despite average mortgage rates being higher at the time, potentially influenced by increased builder incentives. The median price of a new home also saw a slight increase year-over-year, though many builders reported cutting prices in September. While strong sales reduced inventory, single-family housing starts and permits slowed, suggesting builders anticipated less demand. Economists are awaiting further data to confirm if this trend will continue with recent rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wells Fargo is aggressively expanding its credit card business, aiming to challenge larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, especially after the recent lifting of the Federal Reserve's punitive asset cap. The bank has launched at least nine new credit cards since 2021 and significantly increased advertising, leading to a 9% jump in credit card revenue last quarter. Despite a previous setback with the Bilt partnership, Wells Fargo leverages its vast existing customer base for cross-selling, a strategy analysts describe as a "natural evolution." While the bank remains prudent with credit extension due to economic uncertainties, its growth in receivables and overall balance sheet expansion post-cap lift is a key focus for investors.

          <p>Ford Motor is offering special financing to subprime buyers with FICO scores below 620 for its F-150 pickup trucks, aiming to boost sales before the end of the third quarter.

Ford Credit states it only finances creditworthy customers using a proprietary scoring model, with only 3-4% of its financing going to "higher risk" consumers since 2024. This promotion comes as affordability remains a significant concern in the automotive industry and follows a recent Federal Reserve rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

While European defense firms saw their shares rise, a German CFO noted Trump's comments reaffirm existing warnings about Russia's intentions rather than fundamentally changing the industry's situation.

While Southeast Asian nations aim to diversify to avoid over-reliance on any single power, many remain highly exposed to China in key sectors.
