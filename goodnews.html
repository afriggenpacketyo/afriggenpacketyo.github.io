          <p>The Fundstrat Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (GRNY), created by market strategist Tom Lee, has rapidly grown to $1.5 billion in assets just eight months after its launch. The active stock fund has outperformed its benchmark, the MSCI USA Large Cap Index, delivering a return of about 14% this year. The "granny shot" strategy involves selecting stocks that align with multiple long-term investment themes, such as AI, cybersecurity, and millennial-driven trends, to ensure consistent performance. The fund's rules-based process aims to increase the likelihood of steady results over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Report Highlights 'Bridge Strategy' to Maximize Social Security Retirement Benefits by Delaying Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:37:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center suggests that retirees can significantly increase their lifetime income by using a "bridge strategy" to delay claiming Social Security benefits until age 70. Waiting past the full retirement age can boost monthly payments by 8% annually, a return difficult to match elsewhere. However, only about 10% of beneficiaries wait until 70, with many claiming early at 62 and receiving permanently reduced payments. The strategy involves using other funds, such as investment portfolios or annuities, to cover living expenses during the gap years, thus securing a larger, inflation-protected income stream for life.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of July 10, 2025, average national interest rates for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.70%, while a 15-year mortgage is approximately 5.88%, according to Bankrate data. Although rates remain higher than in recent years, they may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profile, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s. It is also recommended to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts is a low 0.38%, consumers can earn substantially more by using high-yield savings accounts, which are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30% in July 2025. These accounts, often provided by online banks with lower overhead costs, can generate significantly more interest over time compared to traditional accounts. Experts recommend choosing high-yield options and comparing different online banks to find the best rates and lowest fees. This strategy allows savers to maximize earnings on their emergency funds and other savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Premier League is discussing plans with the International Football Association Board (Ifab) to introduce "Ref Cams" during matches, potentially as early as next season. These small cameras, mounted on the referee's ear, would provide broadcasters and viewers with a unique, on-field perspective of the action. Following successful trials by FIFA at the Club World Cup, the technology could first be tested in the Premier League's US Summer Series. The move, which would require approval from the clubs, is seen as a way to enhance the viewing experience for fans.</p>

This recent surge continues a strong performance for the cryptocurrency, with investors anticipating further gains as corporate adoption grows and potential crypto legislation moves through Congress.

The denim maker now expects revenue to grow 1% to 2%, an improvement from its previous forecast, and delivered second-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations. The company stated it plans to absorb some of the financial impact from new tariffs, which it estimates will be around $25-$30 million for the rest of the year.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will now consider drug affordability when awarding new "national priority" vouchers, which can reduce drug review times to as little as one or two months. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary stated that this move aligns with the Trump administration's goal of lowering drug prices for Americans. The program aims to incentivize companies to address U.S. national interests, such as developing innovative cures and increasing domestic manufacturing. However, it is unclear how the FDA will assess affordability, as drug prices are typically set after approval.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. continues to threaten trade partners with tariffs, analysts recommend that Beijing adopt a pragmatic, long-term strategy to strengthen its own economic alliances. This approach involves offering tangible benefits like broader market access and greater regional integration to its neighbors and trade partners. By doing so, China can build a more unified regional market and create a collective counterweight to Washington's protectionist policies. This shift in strategy aims to move beyond strongly worded warnings to create a more resilient economic bloc in preparation for future negotiations.</p>
