        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Changes in toilet habits can be indicators of underlying health issues, and it's important to consult a doctor if these changes persist. Experts recommend seeking medical advice for major changes in stool, blood in the stool, changes in urine, frequent or infrequent urination, mucus in the stool, and pain or straining during bowel movements. It is important to be aware of one's baseline 'normal' and to seek medical attention if deviations from that baseline occur, as early detection can lead to better outcomes.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., will host a large military parade to mark the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday and Flag Day. The parade, expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, will feature thousands of soldiers, aircraft, vehicles, and animals. While Trump's birthday is not officially linked to the event, he has long desired a large-scale military parade. The event has drawn criticism from some lawmakers who view it as a costly vanity project and an inappropriate display of military might.</p>
