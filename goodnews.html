          <h2>Netflix Stock Reaches All-Time High Amid Unprecedented Winning Streak</h2>

          <p>Netflix's stock has achieved an unprecedented 11-day winning streak, trading at all-time high levels since its 2002 IPO. This surge follows a strong earnings report revealing a 13% revenue increase in Q1 2025, driven by subscription and advertising growth. Netflix has outperformed traditional media stocks, which have been negatively impacted by market volatility stemming from Trump's trade policies. Despite price hikes, Netflix seems to have maintained its value proposition for consumers, although the company has stopped sharing membership numbers. The article suggests that Netflix's resilience in the face of economic uncertainty has bolstered investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has rebounded from April's downturn, fueled by optimism surrounding potential trade discussions. However, anxieties persist among investors regarding the economic ramifications of President Trump's policies, particularly tariffs. The S&P 500 has recovered to pre-tariff levels, supported by a positive jobs report and indications of willingness from both the U.S. and China to engage in trade talks, though a deal remains distant. Despite this recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, and companies are struggling to forecast future performance due to trade policy uncertainty. The article underscores the market's sensitivity to the Trump administration's economic policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist after a three-year investigation. The BfV cited the party's actions against the constitution's fundamental principles, including human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law. This designation is likely to further isolate the AfD, despite its electoral strength as the country's largest opposition party. The article notes that mainstream parties have shunned the AfD, denying it governing coalition roles, and the BfV's decision may strengthen efforts to keep the AfD out of key parliamentary roles.</p>

          <p>Temu, the online retailer known for ultra-discounted items shipped directly from China, has halted direct shipping to the U.S. as the de minimis tariff loophole expires. The company has shifted its website to only display products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. The end of de minimis and Trump's new tariffs on China have forced Temu to raise prices and alter its selection of goods. The article explains how the change will impact Temu's business model and prices for American shoppers.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos, founder and executive chairman of Amazon, plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing on Friday. The stake would be worth about $4.8 billion at the current price. While profit and revenue topped estimates, the company's forecast for operating income in the current quarter came in below Wall Street's expectations. The results show that Amazon is bracing for uncertainty related to President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.</p>
