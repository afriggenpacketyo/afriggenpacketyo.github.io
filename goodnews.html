          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at revitalizing the nuclear power industry, leading to a rally in nuclear stocks. The orders focus on small, advanced reactors and streamline the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) licensing process, mandating decisions within 18 months. The actions also support uranium mining and domestic enrichment, while creating a regulatory framework for building reactors on federal land. The article notes that advanced reactor companies Oklo and NuScale saw significant gains, as well as Constellation Energy and Cameco Corp.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, Harvard University sued the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security moved to block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accuses the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù against the university. Harvard sought a temporary restraining order, arguing the ban would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university, which was granted by a Boston judge. The conflict stems from the administration's claims of antisemitism and liberal biases on campus.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during construction. The FAA directed "go-arounds" for the commercial aircraft out of caution, citing inconclusive data on the helicopter's location. The Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety concerns after the incident, which follows a deadly midair collision earlier this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge John Bates stated that the order infringes on the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments, resembling a "screed" with "a great deal of animosity" towards the firm. The executive order had instructed officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearances and terminate government contracts. This is the second setback for Trump's efforts to punish law firms involved in legal challenges against his administration.</p>
