          <p>Twenty-two state attorneys general are pressing Senate leaders to swiftly confirm Ed Martin, President Trump's nominee for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, before a May 20 deadline. Concerns are rising that if Martin is not confirmed, judges on a court led by a Trump-antagonist could select a temporary replacement. The attorneys general argue that crime has spiraled in the nation's capital under the Biden administration, and Martin has already shown leadership in restoring the rule of law during his interim period. They cite Martin's actions against pro-Hamas protestors and Chinese-backed hackers as evidence of his effectiveness.</p>

          <p>President Trump downplayed concerns about the impact of his new tariffs on China, suggesting that American children can be content with fewer toys. He stated that a young girl does not need 37 dolls and can be happy with just a few, even if they cost slightly more. Critics, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have criticized Trump's comments as being out of touch with the struggles of working-class families. Republican strategist Karl Rove likened Trump to "Mr. Scrooge" for his remarks on potential toy shortages.</p>

          <p>Hawaii lawmakers have passed a first-of-its-kind bill that will increase the state's lodging tax and impose a new tax on cruise ship bills to fund environmental protection and strengthen defenses against natural disasters. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to the existing tax on short-term accommodations and an 11% tax on cruise ship bills. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects like beach replenishment and clearing flammable invasive grasses.

While Alpine has declined to comment, sources indicate the switch is nearing finalization before the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix. The decision comes despite Doohan recently out-qualifying his teammate, Pierre Gasly, but he has also experienced several incidents and crashes this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This May, qualifying for a HELOC depends on sufficient home equity, strong credit, a low debt-to-income ratio, and stable income. Most lenders want at least 15% to 20% equity, a credit score of 620 or higher, and a DTI below 43%. To improve approval chances, check your credit report, lower your DTI by paying off debts, shop around for lenders with different criteria, or add a co-applicant. Homeowners with high equity have a strong starting point, but lenders are cautious due to the economic climate.</p>
