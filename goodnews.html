          <p>The potential revival of the Constitution Pipeline project is creating a political tug-of-war between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul, with Coterra Energy positioned to benefit significantly. The pipeline project, which was shelved five years ago, has resurfaced after Trump lifted a stop-work order on the Empire Wind 1 project. Coterra CEO Tom Jorden has emphasized the importance of the Constitution Pipeline, which would originate in their Marcellus field in Northeast Pennsylvania and extend into the New England market. If the pipeline were to be built, Coterra would commit to delivering long-term volumes into the line, representing a potential future opportunity for growth in the Marcellus.

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed barriers in 401(k) plans to buying cryptocurrency and related digital assets, rescinding guidance put in place by the Biden-era Labor Department in 2022. The previous guidance cautioned employers to exercise "extreme care" before making crypto investments available to their workers, citing "serious concerns" about the prudence of exposing retirement savings to crypto given "significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss." The Trump Labor Department has withdrawn that guidance in full. Philip Chao, a certified financial planner, suggests that the Labor Department move signals to employers that they can add digital assets to their 401(k) lineups at will and without consequence.

The move also comes as US President Donald Trump's elevation of Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the Department of Health and Human Services has pushed concerns about processed foods to the front of public health debates.
