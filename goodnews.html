          <h2>California Bill Aims to Ban Face Coverings by Law Enforcement Officers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 17:50:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed bill in California seeks to make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty, requiring them to be identifiable by their uniform and name or identifier. State Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin introduced the bill to promote transparency and public trust in law enforcement. They cited recent incidents where federal officers conducted raids while covering their faces, raising concerns about accountability and potential impersonation. The bill would not apply to the National Guard, SWAT teams, or officers responding to natural disasters, aiming to balance transparency with operational needs.</p>

          <p>Arkansas' Gage Wood pitched a no-hitter in the College World Series, striking out a record 19 batters in a 3-0 victory against Murray State, marking the first CWS no-hitter in 65 years. Wood's performance was the third no-hitter in College World Series history, joining Jim Ehrler of Texas in 1950 and Jim Wixson of Oklahoma State in 1960. The junior right-hander's bid for a perfect game ended in the eighth inning when he hit a batter, but he finished strong with consecutive strikeouts to end the inning. Arkansas advanced to another elimination game, while Murray State concluded their first CWS appearance with a 0-2 record.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a significant increase after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The approval came with the condition that the companies sign a national security agreement with the U.S. government, which includes a golden share granting the U.S. president "total control". The U.S. government will have veto power over decisions such as relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters, moving production or jobs outside the U.S., renaming the company, and closing plants.
