          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump over 10% after it reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stabilization in travel bookings. While the airline had previously cut its outlook due to lower-than-expected demand, its third-quarter earnings and revenue projections have now surpassed Wall Street expectations. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while corporate travel has leveled off, travelers are still booking flights, albeit closer to their travel dates. The airline's growth was bolstered by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large, orange-hued full moon, known as the 'buck moon,' will be visible over the United Kingdom, with peak viewing on Thursday evening. The moon's low position in the sky, a result of a major lunar standstill that occurs every 18.6 years, will cause it to appear larger and take on an orange color due to sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere. The name 'buck moon' originates from Native American traditions, referring to the time of year when new antlers grow on buck deer. The phenomenon will be visible in the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

          <p>An international conference aimed at rebuilding Ukraine is underway in Rome, with leaders urging private businesses to invest in the war-torn country's recovery now, despite the ongoing conflict. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy opened the event, which is expected to secure over €10 billion in investments through various deals and a new equity fund. Amid uncertainties about future U.S. military support, European leaders emphasized that rebuilding Ukraine is a strategic investment in a resilient nation. Zelenskyy reiterated his call for a coordinated, Marshall Plan-style effort and the use of frozen Russian assets for reconstruction.</p>

          <p>After a historic performance last year where he won three stages and the green jersey, Eritrean cyclist Biniam Girmay is facing a more challenging Tour de France this year. Despite a strong second-place finish in the opening stage, the 25-year-old has been hampered by a knee injury, though he still aims to win a stage and contend for the points classification. Girmay, who remains the sole African rider in this year's race, acknowledges his role as a representative for his continent. His coach notes that while Girmay remains unchanged by his success, he has matured as an athlete.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturer Nvidia briefly reached a historic market valuation of $4 trillion as its stock price surged, fueled by intense investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The California-based company, led by Jensen Huang, has become a central player in the AI boom, supplying critical hardware to tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. This milestone reflects Wall Street's strong conviction that AI is the future, with Nvidia positioned as a primary beneficiary. The company's value has recovered strongly after an earlier downturn, reporting nearly $19 billion in recent quarterly earnings despite US export controls limiting sales to China.

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, Darcy Deefholts, has been rescued after being feared lost at sea, having spent the night on an uninhabited island several miles offshore. Deefholts went missing after going for a surf near Wooli, New South Wales, prompting a large-scale search by police and marine rescue teams. He was found safe the following day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles from the coast. His father, who had made an emotional plea for help, described the rescue as a 'one in a million miracle,' and Deefholts is now receiving medical treatment.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory in her legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules. The European Court of Human Rights' Grand Chamber ruled that the Swiss Federal Supreme Court violated her right to a fair hearing when it upheld regulations requiring her to reduce her natural testosterone levels to compete. Semenya, who has differences of sexual development (DSD), has been barred from her signature 800m event since 2019. While the ruling does not immediately overturn the athletic regulations, it keeps her legal challenge alive and could send the case back to the Swiss court.</p>

          <p>Temperatures across the United Kingdom are set to rise, with a heatwave forecast to peak over the weekend, potentially reaching 34°C (93°F). The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for all regions of England, warning of potential impacts on health services. This will be the third time this year that some areas have met the official heatwave threshold, defined as three consecutive days above a certain temperature. Climate scientists reiterate that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent, intense, and prolonged due to climate change, impacting both human health and wildlife.</p>

          <p>Following its use in New York City's mayoral primary, this article explores how ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California's political dynamics. Unlike New York's partisan primaries, California's top-two 'jungle primary' system could interact with RCV in unique ways, potentially eliminating the need for primary elections in many local races and saving taxpayer money. Proponents argue RCV fosters less negative campaigning and could give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races. However, the potential for strategic crossover voting could lead to more centrist outcomes or, conversely, push candidates toward more extreme positions to capture second-choice votes.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent trip to South Carolina is being widely interpreted as an early exploration of a 2028 presidential bid. While Newsom framed the visit as an effort to help the Democratic party and connect with rural communities, his presence in the crucial early primary state drew significant attention. He was joined by influential Rep. James Clyburn, who called him a 'hell of a candidate.' Newsom used the platform to position himself as a leader of the resistance against the Trump administration, touting his state's legal battles against the White House and railing against what he called 'America in reverse.'</p>

          <p>DC Studios is betting that its new 'Superman' film can save its film franchise after a series of recent box office disappointments. Under the new leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran, the movie is intended to kick-start a new, more cohesive era for DC's superheroes, a model that has long been a challenge for the Warner Bros. brand compared to rival Marvel. While Superman is a global icon, the character's earnest, nearly invincible nature has made him difficult to adapt for modern audiences. The film, directed by Gunn, faces the monumental task of restoring faith in the DC brand.</p>
