          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is directly challenging President Trump over immigration raids in her city, accusing him of creating fear among immigrants and potentially devastating the local economy. Bass criticized Trump for misrepresenting the National Guard's role and wasting resources on unnecessary troops. This marks a shift from Bass's previous approach of avoiding public disputes with other elected officials, particularly Trump. The mayor has warned that L.A. is becoming a testing ground for Trump to usurp the authority of Democratic mayors and governors, as the raids have caused significant disruption and trauma among residents. </p>

          <p>Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, has resigned after Donald Trump attempted to fire her, accusing her of being partisan and a supporter of DEI. The Smithsonian Institution had previously rebuffed Trump's attempt to fire Sajet, asserting its independence. Sajet stated that stepping aside was the best way to serve the institution. The resignation comes after Trump announced he had fired Sajet, citing her Democratic political donations and rejection of a pro-Trump painting. </p>

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock dropped after the air taxi maker announced it sold $850 million worth of shares to support new infrastructure, AI software, and its Launch Edition program. The funding round included the sale of 85 million shares at $10 apiece, giving the company a pro forma liquidity position of roughly $2 billion. The stock offering follows President Trump's executive order creating a pilot program to support eVTOL vehicles. Archer has partnered with United Airlines to roll out an airport air taxi service and will display its Midnight eVTOL aircraft at the Paris Air Show. (not investment advice)</p>
