        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily from Newark Liberty International Airport, representing about 10% of its schedule, after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the cancellations to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and technological problems within the Federal Aviation Administration. Kirby stated that the airline had no other choice but to reduce flights to protect customers, urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were causing delays at Newark, and Kirby noted that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark had recently left their positions after technology failures.
