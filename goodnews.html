          <h2>Study Reveals High-Dose Radiotherapy May Paradoxically Promote Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 01:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre has found that high doses of radiation therapy, commonly used to target and destroy cancer cells, can paradoxically promote the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly exposed to radiation. Led by biochemist Yang Kaiting, the research demonstrated that while radiotherapy effectively controls localized cancer tumors, it may also inadvertently stimulate distant metastasis, acting as a double-edged sword. This groundbreaking work highlights the complex and sometimes counterintuitive effects of cancer treatments, suggesting the need for more refined and targeted approaches. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fujirebio Holdings, a Japanese company, will launch the first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the United States starting in late June, following FDA clearance. The test, designed for individuals 55 and older exhibiting signs of the disease, detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's. This non-invasive method, taking approximately 30 minutes from blood draw to diagnosis, is expected to be more accessible and less costly than specialized PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid tests. The availability of this blood test is considered a crucial step in facilitating the widespread use of new Alzheimer's treatments. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, predicting it would be completed by the end of his term. The system, designed to protect against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, faces technical, logistical, and financial hurdles. Trump has said the project will cost $175 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates it could cost between $161 billion and $542 billion. General Michael Guetlein of the Space Force will oversee the project, which aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. </p>

Koizumi's commitment to easing these concerns signals a proactive approach to tackling the issue and stabilizing rice prices for consumers. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While media attention often focuses on young men supposedly shifting to the far right, a more significant trend is the sharp leftward turn among young women. Research indicates that young people generally hold more progressive values than previous generations, and the gender gap is primarily due to young women's increasing support for left-leaning policies and values. This shift presents a political opportunity for center-left parties, which should prioritize the values of female voters, such as climate action and a strong welfare state, rather than chasing an outdated interpretation of the "working-class" voter. This strategy could transform political discourse and encourage greater participation from young women in elections. </p>

          <p>Chengdu, a city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young people seek a more relaxed lifestyle compared to the hypercompetitive coastal cities. The city's appeal reflects a growing disillusionment among young people who see an economy that is no longer creating the opportunities it once did. Chengdu offers a vibrant LGBTQ community, a thriving hip-hop scene, and a plethora of teahouses, making it an attractive alternative to the stressful environment of megacities. The influx of transplants has led to increased housing prices, but the city remains more affordable and offers a better quality of life. </p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a shortage of professionals caused by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. However, the profession is plagued by high tuition costs, leading to significant debt, and alarming suicide rates, which are four times higher than the general population. The increasing willingness of owners to spend on pet care has made investments in veterinary medicine popular, leading to corporate-owned clinics and rising prices. Despite the pressures, students are drawn to the field by their love for animals and are seeking support and mentorship to navigate the challenges. </p>
