          <p>Erling Haaland showcased a commanding all-around performance, scoring two goals to lead Manchester City to a 3-0 victory over Manchester United. Beyond his offensive prowess, Haaland made crucial defensive contributions, including multiple clearances during a period of pressure from United. Manager Pep Guardiola praised the striker, stating he is even better this season than during the team's Treble-winning year. The performance highlighted Haaland's development into a more complete player, contributing significantly on both ends of the pitch.</p>

          <p>The small tourist town of Stanley, Idaho, narrowly avoided destruction from two separate wildfires during the "unprecedented" 2024 fire season, a story that remains relevant amid ongoing wildfire threats in the western U.S. Heroic firefighting efforts and favorable weather shifts saved the town and the nearby Redfish Lake Lodge from the Bench Lake and Wapiti fires. The incident serves as a case study on the growing risk to communities in fire-prone areas, highlighting how even with early-season resources, a combination of extreme drought and multiple simultaneous fires can push a region to its limits.</p>

          <p>England's men's cricket head coach, Brendon McCullum, has indicated that the selection for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia will be straightforward, calling the team "pretty settled." The main point of discussion is expected to be the choice of a second spinner to back up Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that up to seven specialist seam bowlers could be included in the 17-player squad and that Ollie Pope would continue to serve as the backup wicketkeeper. The squad is scheduled to be announced in the week of September 22, ahead of the tour beginning in November.</p>

          <p>British supermarket chain Sainsbury's has officially terminated talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise subsidiary, Argos. The decision was made after JD.com reportedly sought to proceed only on "materially revised" terms, which Sainsbury's concluded were not in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the collapse of the potential deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying retail operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>
