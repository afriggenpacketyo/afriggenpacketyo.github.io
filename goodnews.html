          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca expressed his belief in Acheampong's potential to become a top defender for Chelsea, emphasizing that the best plan for his development is to remain with the team. Sources close to the player have refuted suggestions of his frustration at the club, highlighting his recent five-year contract and breakthrough season. A loan move would only be considered if all parties agree it is the optimal path for his career progression.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have been sent back to China as their loan agreement expired. The pandas‚Äî24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring‚Äîwere part of a successful joint breeding program that began in 1994 and produced 17 cubs. Their departure, which was marked by a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors, leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo. Those two are also scheduled to return to China next February, potentially ending the era of "panda diplomacy" in the country for now.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower incidence of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, surveying nearly 12,500 employees. While 30.9% of the total cohort showed depressive symptoms, those who adhered more closely to a Japanese diet were less likely to report them. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, prevalent in the diet, may play a role in supporting mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The May 16 escape, which authorities have called the worst in recent state history, involved inmates breaking through a faulty cell door and a wall. Only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by Kat Sadler, explores dark and taboo subjects through the lens of a financially and romantically struggling family. The show, starring Sadler and her real-life sister Lizzie Davidson, follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate life with a twisted and scheming perspective. Sadler notes that the show is influenced by their all-woman upbringing and observations of the modern world, including what she calls the "bleak" dating scene. The series satirizes the pressures to be in a relationship, presenting being single as the characters' "worst nightmare."</p>

Research from Chubu University has shown that the cactus, known for its high mineral and fiber content, may enhance immune function. Farmers in Kasugai, a city known for cactus cultivation, are now growing edible varieties and marketing them for both human consumption and as pet food. Experts see great potential in the resilient plant as a sustainable food source, aligning with a UN recommendation highlighting its value in the face of climate change.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential of bacteriophages, or "phages," which are viruses that prey on bacteria, as a solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. The author participates in an experiment, collecting samples from his home and discovering a phage capable of killing a patient's persistent infection in a lab setting. Phage therapy is a century-old idea that was largely abandoned with the advent of antibiotics but is now being revisited as superbugs become more common. While challenges remain in bringing this treatment to mainstream medicine, it offers a promising alternative for fighting incurable infections.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing unprecedented views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Using a specific radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate foliage and clouds to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. The first images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, offering scientists a powerful new tool to understand these vital ecosystems. Over the coming years, the data will be used to create a global 3D map of forests, enabling more accurate estimates of their role in mitigating climate change.</p>

Feeling isolated, she spent hundreds of hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she knew from her more outgoing elementary school days. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation. The project not only helped Schafer feel "seen again" but also prompted feelings of regret among her classmates for not having paid more attention to her, serving as a powerful lesson in connection.</p>

Hazlewood was the chief architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the hosts' top order.
