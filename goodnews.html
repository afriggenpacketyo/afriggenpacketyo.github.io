          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has completed a 62-mile, 12-day swim around Martha's Vineyard, aiming to become the first person to accomplish this feat and change public perception of sharks. Pugh began swimming multiple hours a day in the frigid waters to raise awareness about the plight of sharks as the film "Jaws" nears its 50th anniversary, which he says maligned the animals. Despite the challenges, Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, hopes his swim will highlight the need for shark conservation, given that around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day.</p>
