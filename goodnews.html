          <p>President Trump pardoned reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been serving prison sentences since 2022 for bank and tax fraud. The couple, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were convicted of conspiring to defraud banks out of millions and concealing income from the IRS. Trump stated that the Chrisleys received "pretty harsh treatment", and their lawyer claimed they were targeted due to their conservative values. The Chrisleys' daughter, Savannah, spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, thanking Trump for standing up against political prosecutions. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of insuring exposure to U.S. government debt has been rising, with credit default swaps (CDS) hovering near their highest level in two years, signaling investor nervousness about the U.S. government's ability to pay its debt. The surge in demand for CDS contracts is seen as a hedge against political risk and fiscal policy concerns, particularly the unresolved debt ceiling. While investors are pricing in increased concerns, industry watchers suggest it reflects anxiety about U.S. fiscal policy rather than an expectation of imminent default. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a tax cut package that could raise the debt ceiling, pending Senate approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump says the Boeing 747-8 gifted by Qatar is too big to be his personal plane, despite intended as a replacement Air Force One. Trump now considers it a gift to the nation, not a perk for him, as it is being refitted for military standard. The original offer sparked criticism, particularly following Trump's visit to Qatar focusing on trade deals. He criticized Boeing for delays in replacing the current Air Force One, which dates back to the early 1990s, necessitating an expedited replacement from another country.</p>

Former Chelsea players praised Palmer's genius and maturity, highlighting his impact on the team's success.

          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. The change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, aims to lower household bills and cut emissions by making heat pump installations easier. Consumer groups, however, warn that the changes will not help renters or leaseholders, and the high upfront costs remain a barrier. The government also aims to give 300,000 households upgrades to improve their energy efficiency and lower bills.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will spend more than ¬£1 billion to develop battlefield technology and establish a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command. The funding, a result of the government's strategic defence review, aims to speed up decision-making on the battlefield and enhance cyber capabilities. The MoD said the new Digital Targeting Web would better connect soldiers with key information, while the Cyber Command would oversee military cyber operations. The extra investment is possible due to the government's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.</p>

          <p>President Trump pushed back on a new acronym, "Taco," used to describe a way to profit from his negotiating style, where he often reduces tariff levels after initially proposing high rates. Trump responded with sarcasm and indignation, defending his actions as strategic rather than "chickening out." He cited his reduction of tariffs on China and his interactions with the European Union as examples of successful negotiation. The acronym refers to the idea that Trump always "chickens out" in trade talks.</p>
