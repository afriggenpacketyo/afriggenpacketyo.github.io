          <p>A couple volunteering at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks and is believed to have been part of a larger, brightly painted ornamental arch and gate. Experts suggest the carving represents the end of the Severan wars and the establishment of the fort at the site. The Vindolanda Trust curator noted that similar finds from Roman Britain are increasingly rare, highlighting the importance of the discovery.

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth, recognized for his opposition to Nazi rule. Mann's literary works and political essays reflected his life as an exile after escaping Germany in the 1930s. He gained global recognition for novels like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," and he used his platform to criticize the Nazi regime and advocate for social democracy. After emigrating to the US, Mann continued to speak out against fascism through radio broadcasts to Germany.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell advised Princeton graduates to "guard" their integrity amidst ongoing criticism from President Donald Trump. In his commencement address, Powell emphasized the importance of doing what is right and maintaining honor. This comes as Trump has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates, even threatening to fire him. Powell has maintained a wait-and-see approach, focusing on economic data and the Fed's mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, independent of political pressure. Powell's commitment to integrity underscores the importance of independent decision-making in economic policy.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure projects across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. This investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. Reeves aims to address regional disparities by directing more funds to areas in need, including the "Red Wall" constituencies. The transport investment is part of a five-year funding allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32, doubling the current spending allocation by 2029-30.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the Model Y. Despite a global sales slump, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with Model Y sales soaring 122.5% year-over-year. However, total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. The company's global sales have been affected by increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, although recent shifts indicate a potential recovery. Tesla faces tighter competition, particularly from Chinese EV makers like BYD, which has been expanding globally.</p>
