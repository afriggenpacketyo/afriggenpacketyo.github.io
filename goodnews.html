          <p>Microsoft is set to reduce its workforce by approximately 3%, impacting around 6,000 employees across various levels and geographical locations. The layoffs are part of a broader streamlining effort focused on reducing management layers and enhancing efficiency within the company. This move follows Microsoft's recent quarterly earnings report, which showed strong sales and profits, with revenue up 13% from the same period last year. Microsoft had previously conducted a major workforce reduction in 2023, cutting 11,000 jobs worldwide, and this new round of layoffs is intended to minimize redundancy and position the company for continued success in a dynamic marketplace.</p>

          <p>Audra McDonald's portrayal of Rose in the Broadway revival of "Gypsy" is receiving critical acclaim for its raw and devastating exploration of the character's psyche.

The New York Times article discusses how McDonald's interpretation exposes a deeper, more visceral level of emotion, making the show feel both familiar and startlingly new. The performance culminates in "Rose's Turn," a number that leaves audience members feeling sucker-punched by its emotional intensity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is initiating a scientific review aimed at removing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market by October 31. While fluoride is known to strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, the FDA cites studies suggesting ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and could be associated with thyroid disorders, weight gain, and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has a history of questioning fluoride's safety, supports the move, though dental experts largely disagree, citing decades of data showing fluoride's safety and effectiveness in preventing dental decay.</p>

          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, such as easing inflation and a steady job market, credit card debt forgiveness remains a relevant option for many Americans struggling with high-interest debt. While the economy may show signs of stabilization, the cost of carrying credit card debt remains high, making it difficult for households to catch up. Credit card debt forgiveness offers targeted relief by drastically reducing the debt obligation, providing a path out of a seemingly endless debt cycle. The article advises considering debt forgiveness if debt feels unmanageable, falling behind on payments, or exploring alternatives have proven unfeasible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DA Davidson analyst suggests that Alphabet (Google) would be better off undergoing a "big bang breakup" by spinning off its individual businesses into separately traded entities. The analyst argues that Google's current market capitalization is undervalued due to its low earnings multiple and that a breakup would allow its businesses to be valued more highly, comparable to their peers. Proposed spinoffs include YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo, and its AI segments, potentially increasing Google's overall value to $3.7 trillion.

          <p>In this installment of "Dear James," James Parker addresses a reader's persistent stage fright, which manifests as physical anxiety during public speaking or presentations. Parker, drawing from his own experience with a childhood stammer, suggests meditation as a tool to cultivate a detached awareness of one's anxiety. By observing the chaos without being consumed by it, one can gradually disengage from the cycle of panic. The article offers a personal and introspective approach to managing performance anxiety.</p>
