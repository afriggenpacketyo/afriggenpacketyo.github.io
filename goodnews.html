        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached all-time highs, driven by positive sentiment surrounding U.S. trade negotiations and the resolution of a digital services tax dispute with Canada. Technology giants like Amazon and Alphabet saw premarket gains after Canada scrapped its planned tax on U.S. tech firms. The market's upward momentum is also supported by investor expectations of potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and a recent stress test finding major U.S. banks well-capitalized, suggesting continued economic resilience.

          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax on U.S. technology firms, paving the way for the resumption of critical trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed tax a "blatant attack." The tax would have imposed a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users of companies like Google and Meta. Canadian officials stated the reversal aims to make vital progress on a new economic and security relationship ahead of a looming tariff deadline.</p>

The hires, who all completed their undergraduate studies in China before pursuing advanced degrees in the U.S., highlight both the intense competition for top AI experts and the significant pool of Chinese talent in the field. The move comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg invests billions to build a leading AI division, reportedly offering massive bonuses to lure engineers from rivals.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a link between age-related hearing loss and a deficiency in a specific protein within the cochlea, the part of the inner ear responsible for hearing. The study, conducted on monkeys, provides a detailed molecular map of the aging process in the primate auditory system at a single-cell level. Scientists also found that the diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of hearing loss in the animals, suggesting a potential future clinical treatment for the common condition, also known as presbycusis, in humans.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink and competitors like Precision Neuroscience and Synchron, are on the verge of commercializing brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. These surgically implanted devices translate thoughts into commands, enabling individuals with paralysis to control computers, smartphones, or generate speech. While Neuralink has garnered significant public attention, the underlying technology has been developing for over two decades. The first generation of commercial products aims to restore communication and digital access, marking a major leap from experimental research to life-changing tools for people with severe disabilities.</p>

          <p>A new law has taken effect in France banning smoking in many public outdoor areas, including parks, beaches, and near schools, as part of a government effort to create a "tobacco-free generation." The ban is specifically aimed at preventing children from being exposed to smoking, with violators facing fines of up to several hundred dollars. While polls show public support for tighter restrictions, some smokers view the measure as excessive. The move represents one of Europe's most restrictive outdoor smoking bans, though it currently does not apply to e-cigarettes or outdoor cafe terraces.</p>

Simultaneously, Reddit is licensing its data to Google and OpenAI and has launched its own AI-powered "Reddit Answers" feature.

          <p>For the first time in its history, the Wimbledon Championships will proceed without human line judges, fully adopting electronic line-calling technology across all courts. The move eliminates a tradition dating back 148 years, replacing the on-court officials with an automated system. While the technology is intended to increase accuracy and speed up play, some players and traditionalists lament the loss of a human element and personality from the game. The change also raises questions about the future career path for tennis umpires, as line judging has long been a crucial training ground.</p>

The agreement reduces tariffs on the first 100,000 vehicles annually and eliminates them for aerospace exports. However, the deal leaves the UK steel and aluminum industries in a precarious position, as they still face a 25% tariff that could double if a separate agreement is not reached by a July 9 deadline, creating significant uncertainty for producers.

This resurgence, the best first-half performance since 2021, was driven by increased participation from international investors and strong post-listing returns for new stocks.
