          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, defeated Australia 47-7, securing their place in the World Cup quarter-finals where they will face Scotland. Despite a somewhat unsteady first half, the team rallied to extend their winning streak to 30 consecutive Test matches. Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scored two tries in the decisive victory. However, the win was tempered by injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman, which could pose challenges for the team as they advance in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference in Birmingham demonstrates the party's significant and rapid expansion over the past year. The event, held at the large NEC venue, has adopted the scale of a major party conference while maintaining an insurgent, grassroots energy. Political editor Chris Mason notes the professionalization of the party's structure, with regional stands and a growing volunteer network, attracting disaffected voters from both the Conservative and Labour parties. Leader Nigel Farage's call for "discipline" among activists underscores a serious ambition to move beyond protest and become a major political force.</p>

The final is a highly anticipated rematch of their recent Wimbledon clash, where Sinner's aggressive play secured him the win.

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire governor of Illinois, is increasingly taking on a prominent role within the Democratic Party as a vocal opponent of Donald Trump. As a scion of the Hyatt Hotels family, Pritzker has used his personal wealth to support his political ambitions, notably helping bring the Democratic National Convention to Chicago. He has positioned himself as a key figure in the party's more combative wing, frequently using his platform to directly challenge Trump's policies and rhetoric. This profile highlights his rise as a significant force in national Democratic politics.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a significant reshuffle of his ministerial team, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Key moves include Yvette Cooper's shift from the Home Office to the Foreign Office, with Shabana Mahmood taking over as the new Home Secretary. The reshuffle involves numerous changes in junior ministerial roles across various departments, including the appointment of business leader Jason Stockwood to the House of Lords as a business minister. These changes are seen as an attempt by the Prime Minister to reset his government's agenda and tackle key issues like illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>A new environmental chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a multimillion-dollar buyout deal led to the departure of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a large-scale, five-year restoration effort aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants and promote the regrowth of native grasslands. While the transition is a major conservation opportunity, it has also created tension over the loss of multigenerational ranches.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage in Rome, celebrating a greater sense of acceptance within the Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, stating it is time to "restore dignity to everyone," which was met with a standing ovation. Participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming tone, which they hope will be continued by his successor, Pope Leo XIV. The event, listed on the Vatican's official Jubilee calendar, marks a significant shift from 25 years ago, when a similar pilgrimage was met with official resistance.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing locked magnetic pouches, such as those made by Yondr, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches upon entering school, which they carry with them but can only be unlocked at magnetic stations at the end of the day. The policy aims to reduce distractions and improve student engagement, a move supported by many educators who felt phones were hindering learning. While some students have welcomed the change, others have expressed frustration and sought ways to circumvent the system.</p>

The alert, designed to warn of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks, will cause compatible phones to vibrate and emit a siren sound for about 10 seconds. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that revealed technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed.
