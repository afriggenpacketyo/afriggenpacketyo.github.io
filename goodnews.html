          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Russia from May 7th for four days to attend the Victory Day ceremony in Moscow, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. During the visit, Xi is expected to engage in "strategic communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin on bilateral ties and major international and regional issues. The two leaders are also expected to sign several bilateral accords, further strengthening the relationship between Russia and China amidst Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion. Russia and China have been strengthening their ties in recent years, with Beijing opposing Western sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine that started in February 2022.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long fight for justice after the murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights in California. After Catina was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Steven Burns, the Salarno family had to navigate a system that often prioritized the rights of the accused over the victim. Harriet Salarno started Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws, allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing and ensuring children are accompanied by a support person when testifying. The family has attended 13 parole hearings to keep Burns behind bars, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to justice and victims' rights.</p>

          <p>Chinese government scientists report successful weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4% across 8,000 sq km. The operation generated more than 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. The test was detailed in a peer-reviewed paper published in Chinese-language journal Desert and Oasis Meteorology. This demonstrates China's growing capabilities in weather modification technology, potentially addressing water scarcity in arid regions.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and alleged Russian interference. The constitutional court found issues in the financing and organization of the leading campaign, with allegations of pro-Georgescu messaging spread via inactive social media accounts as part of a "Russian hybrid attack." While far-right candidate George Simion is expected to advance to a second-round run-off, pro-western candidates are also vying for the presidency, with the election drawing criticism from US and Russian officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article criticizes the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches, arguing that it's another way of making mothers feel guilty. While acknowledging concerns about ultra-processed foods and their nutritional value, the author argues that the criticism often ignores the social, political, and economic factors that influence parents' choices. She highlights the pressure on mothers to engage in "intensive mothering" and the moral judgment associated with choosing convenience over cooking from scratch. The author calls for a more supportive society that facilitates good food choices for parents and children, rather than simply condemning pureed fruit.</p>
