          <p>Most of England is under heat health alerts as the country prepares for a second heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach into the 30s Celsius. An amber alert, affecting regions including London and the south-east, indicates that the heat could impact the entire population and various health services. The high temperatures coincide with major events like the Glastonbury Festival and the start of Wimbledon, with Monday potentially becoming the hottest day of the year so far. This event occurs as scientists note that climate change is making such heatwaves more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Germany is planning to build Europe's largest military, driven by the war in Ukraine and concerns over a potential new Trump presidency. The German government intends to change its constitution to increase defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, a move that was previously unthinkable. This historic rearmament will be financed through a special fund and a temporary suspension of the country's 'debt brake,' aiming to create a more robust armed forces without immediately cutting social programs. The decision reflects a profound change in Germany's post-war defense posture.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the essence of the LGBTQ+ Pride movement is its diversity and that attempts by some conservative gay figures to promote 'respectability politics' are misguided. The author criticizes efforts to mute more flamboyant or gender-nonconforming members of the community to gain broader acceptance, referencing historical figures like Jose Sarria and the Stonewall Riots. The piece specifically calls out Richard Grenell's recent comments, asserting that the movement's progress has always been driven by a broad coalition, not a narrow, heteronormative ideal.</p>

          <p>In a significant local political development, voters in Huntington Beach, California, have passed two ballot measures that rebuke the city's conservative-led council. Measure A successfully dismantled a parent review board that would have controlled the selection of children's books, restoring authority to professional librarians. Measure B blocked the potential privatization of the city's library system, an idea the council had been considering. The outcome is seen as a grassroots victory against the council's MAGA-aligned agenda and a testament to community organizing across political lines.</p>

          <p>A new play by Jake Brasch, "The Reservoir," which recently opened at the Geffen Playhouse, tackles themes of family dysfunction and addiction. The review finds that while the play has noble intentions and features some strong performances, it often relies on familiar sitcom-level humor and theatrical tropes. The protagonist, a young man struggling with alcoholism, interacts with his four eccentric grandparents, who serve as a chorus to his recovery journey. The critic suggests the play's writing and staging lack depth and nuance, making it a well-intentioned but flawed production.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economist Argues Payment Platforms like WeChat and Alipay Give China an Edge in Stablecoin Development</h2>

          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China holds a significant "comparative advantage" in the global development of stablecoins. He argues that the country's mature third-party payment platforms, such as WeChat and Alipay, already function in a similar manner to stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender backed by central bank money. This existing infrastructure and its relatively mature regulatory framework position China to be a leader as stablecoins become more prominent in the global financial landscape.
