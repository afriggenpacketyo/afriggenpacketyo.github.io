          <h2>Sales of New US Homes Surge Unexpectedly in August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 12:52:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. saw a significant and unexpected increase of 20.5% in August compared to the previous month, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This surge occurred despite mortgage rates being relatively high during the period, surprising many economists and analysts. The median price of a new home sold in August was $413,500, an increase of 1.9% year over year. Experts suggest the strong sales may be partially attributed to builder incentives and note the data's large margin of error, awaiting future revisions for a clearer picture.

          <p>A family of three has become the first to be resettled in the UK under its new "one-in, one-out" migrant treaty with France. The agreement stipulates that for every migrant returned to France who crossed the Channel illegally, the UK will accept a refugee with a valid protection case. This arrival follows the deportation of four migrants from the UK to France under the pilot scheme, which was announced by leaders of both nations in July. The UK government states the policy sends a clear message to people-smuggling gangs that illegal entry will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers along the Texas Gulf coast have recently encountered multiple "pink meanie" jellyfish, a rare and massive species that can weigh over 50 pounds and have tentacles reaching up to 70 feet. Jace Tunnell of the Harte Research Institute noted seeing more than ten of the creatures, which are known for their distinct color and their diet of smaller moon jellyfish. First identified as a new species in 2011, pink meanies thrive in warm waters and follow the blooms of their prey. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be relatively mild.</p>

          <p>In a recent "Morning Meeting" segment, CNBC's Jim Cramer declared that aerospace company Boeing is his "favorite stock" in the Investing Club's Charitable Trust portfolio. This endorsement comes as U.S. lawmakers are reportedly pushing for China to place new orders for Boeing aircraft as part of a potential trade agreement. Additionally, Boeing has partnered with Palantir to integrate AI into its defense and space operations. Cramer and his team view the recent 10% dip in Boeing's stock price as a buying opportunity to scale into the position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian-based mining company Lithium Americas surged by over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal is part of renegotiations for a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. An administration official stated that if the loan repayment schedule is extended, the government wants a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. The move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains vital to U.S. interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Oregon's oldest unidentified-person case, police have exhumed the partial remains of a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," nearly 80 years after her dismembered body was found in 1946. The remains were discovered in a burlap sack in the Willamette River, and an initial examination determined she was a middle-aged woman who died from blunt-force trauma. Crucial evidence, including the remains, had been missing from police custody since the 1950s, but investigators recently located them interred at a cemetery. Authorities are now hopeful that modern forensic testing can finally identify the victim.</p>

          <p>Music icon Mariah Carey is releasing "Here for It All," her first new studio album in seven years, a project she created while mourning the deaths of her mother and estranged sister, who passed away on the same day last year. Carey described the period as extremely difficult but found some healing in her final moments with her mother. The album reflects her resilience, and she describes its sound as "new Mariah, but still sounds like Mariah." She has also collaborated with artist Anderson .Paak on several tracks, sparking playful dating rumors that the two have brushed off.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed by New York Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 as the city's first-ever "rat czar," has resigned from her position. Corradi was tasked with tackling the city's significant rodent problem, estimated to include around 3 million rats, with a $3.5 million budget. During her tenure, she implemented initiatives such as rat birth control and public awareness campaigns, which appeared to yield some positive results, with calls to the city's 311 service about rats decreasing. Mayor Adams praised her work and stated that the city's efforts to mitigate its rodent population would continue "at full steam."</p>

          <p>A wave of anti-corruption protests, driven by Generation Z, has swept across several Asian nations, including Nepal, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Young activists are using social media platforms like TikTok, encrypted messaging apps, and AI tools to organize and spread their message, often targeting the perceived lavish lifestyles of "nepo kids" of political figures. These digital-first movements have fostered a sense of cross-national solidarity, with protesters sharing symbols and hashtags. While the protests have led to significant offline consequences, including violence and government resignations, observers question whether this digital outrage can translate into long-term, fundamental change.</p>

          <p>A wildfire near the north shore town of Paia on Maui prompted door-to-door evacuations and the activation of emergency sirens on Tuesday. The fire grew to over 100 acres, creating a "dangerous threat to life and property" and stoking fears of a repeat of the devastating 2023 Lahaina fire. Paia, like Lahaina, is surrounded by dry brush, making it vulnerable. However, firefighters were able to halt the blaze's forward progress, and evacuation orders were lifted later in the day as the immediate threat receded and residents were able to return home.</p>

This marks a substantial increase from the 2 billion monthly users the company last reported in October 2022. The growth solidifies Instagram's position as one of the world's largest social networks, joining its sibling platforms Facebook and WhatsApp in the exclusive 3-billion-user club. Meta acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion when the app had a much smaller user base.</p>

          <h2>Newly Discovered Colossal Object Could Be a Primordial Black Hole, Challenging Cosmological Models</h2>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a mysterious, massive object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this discovery would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from quantum fluctuations just after the Big Bang, predating any stars. While further observation is needed to confirm the object's nature, its existence could force a significant revision of our understanding of how the universe's first structures came into being, potentially giving black holes a more primary role.</p>
