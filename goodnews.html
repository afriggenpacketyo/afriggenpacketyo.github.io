        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. military strikes in Iran, concerns arose about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices, including gasoline. Initially, oil prices surged but later declined as experts predicted Iran was unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions could still impact the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups posing significant risks. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though deemed unlikely, could cause prices to spike dramatically, affecting economies worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, set to begin within six hours, involving two 12-hour ceasefire periods initiated by Iran and followed by Israel. Neither Israeli nor Iranian officials have publicly confirmed Trump's announcement. Trump congratulated both countries for their stamina, courage, and intelligence in ending what he termed 'The 12 Day War.' The announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets two days prior, escalating the conflict that began with Israeli strikes on Iranian military and nuclear targets on June 12.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Constitution divides war powers between Congress, which has the power to declare war, and the president, who serves as commander-in-chief. President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran without Congressional consultation has drawn criticism, highlighting the ongoing tension between the executive and legislative branches regarding military action. While Congress is granted the authority to declare war, presidents have historically engaged in military actions without formal declarations, leading to debates over the limits of executive power. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert Congressional authority, but its effectiveness has been debated, with presidents often sidestepping its requirements.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, highlighting the challenges faced by original animated movies in the current market. Analysts suggest that the film's performance may have been affected by competition from other family-friendly movies and a lack of familiarity with the title among audiences. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience over the summer, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and plans to continue investing in original animated content alongside sequels and franchises.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a U.S. analyst, China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it due to rising Middle East tensions. Instead, China is expected to prioritize quiet negotiations and its own self-interests, rather than direct military intervention. This approach is consistent with China's past actions, such as its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. While China relies heavily on Middle Eastern oil, its response will likely be shaped by economic interests and strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target of spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. The split target is designed to accommodate both US President Donald Trump's calls for increased spending and the financial constraints of EU countries. The government aims to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with the 1.5% resilience element being met the year after next.</p>
