The e-commerce platform also provided a strong third-quarter forecast, with expected revenue growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage rate. The positive results suggest Shopify is successfully navigating trade uncertainties, with its CFO noting that a previously anticipated negative impact from tariffs did not occur, and merchant sales volumes grew significantly.

          <p>This article examines the roles of annuities and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) in retirement strategies, concluding neither is universally superior. CDs offer simplicity and FDIC-insured principal protection, making them suitable for short-term goals, but their returns may not outpace inflation. Annuities are designed to provide guaranteed lifetime income, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, though they are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on individual needs, such as income requirements, risk tolerance, and longevity expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has announced plans to increase its investments in the United States by an additional $100 billion. The White House stated the funds would encourage the domestic manufacturing of Apple components, adding to a previous commitment to spend $500 billion in the U.S. This move is seen as an effort by Apple to mitigate the impact of potential new tariffs on its products, which are largely manufactured in China. The company's CEO, Tim Cook, is expected to make the formal announcement at the White House.</p>

The restaurant, co-led by executive chef Ian Robinson, has been recalibrated with a warmer atmosphere and a focus on inventive, seasonal vegetable dishes. While maintaining an izakaya format with small plates, the review highlights the kitchen's exceptional skill in plant-centered cooking as its most compelling feature.

          <p>Candy manufacturer Mars has entered a partnership with biotech company Pairwise to use CRISPR gene-editing technology to improve its cocoa supply. The collaboration aims to develop cacao plants that are more resilient to diseases, heat, and other climate-related threats that endanger global chocolate production. By using precise gene-editing tools, the companies hope to accelerate the development of stronger, more sustainable crops compared to traditional breeding methods. This initiative reflects a growing trend of major food companies turning to biotechnology to protect their supply chains.</p>

          <p>This article from the CNBC Investing Club explains the rationale behind selling a portion of its holdings in the semiconductor company Broadcom. Despite maintaining a positive outlook on the company's AI-related business, the decision was made to lock in a 238% gain and manage risk. The move was prompted by concerns about potential profit-taking across the hot AI chip sector, as seen with the recent drop in AMD's stock post-earnings. The trim is described as a prudent measure to avoid being "too greedy" with a high-performing stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona Diamondbacks designated hitter Lourdes Gurriel Jr. has set a new MLB record by hitting a home run off the fastest pitch ever recorded for a homer since tracking began in 2008. During a game against the San Diego Padres, he hit a 439-foot, two-run shot off a 103.9-mph fastball from reliever Mason Miller. The historic home run tied the game in the eighth inning, though the Diamondbacks ultimately lost. Gurriel became only the second player known to hit a home run off a pitch thrown faster than 103 mph.</p>

          <p>A scientific study published in the journal Nature has discovered that trees possess a rich internal microbiome, similar to the human gut. Researchers found that an average tree contains approximately one trillion microbial cells, including distinct communities of fungi, bacteria, and viruses specialized for different parts of the wood. The study suggests these microbiomes are unique to each tree species and likely play a crucial role in tree health and defense. This finding opens a new frontier for understanding forest ecosystems and environmental science.</p>
