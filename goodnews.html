        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. Reports suggest the bid was around £110 million plus add-ons, falling short of Newcastle's valuation, which is believed to be approximately £150 million. Isak, who was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, is reportedly keen on exploring a move despite his club's qualification for the Champions League. It remains uncertain if Liverpool, which has already spent heavily this summer, will return with an improved offer for the Swedish international.</p>

          <p>Over two years after suffering a cardiac arrest, basketball player Bronny James has revealed he still experiences lingering health issues, notably a weakened immune system that causes him to get sick more easily. This affects his conditioning, a key area his coach, JJ Redick, believes is crucial for his development into a fantastic NBA player. Despite the health challenges, James has shown significant progress in the G-League and is working to overcome the physical and mental hurdles from the life-threatening event.

          <p>Joby Aviation is partnering with defense giant L3Harris to develop a next-generation military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The collaboration will integrate Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems, with testing expected to begin this fall. Unlike Joby's commercial electric air taxis, this military vehicle will be powered by a gas turbine. The partnership aims to create a smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable aircraft for low-altitude support, reflecting a strategic shift in military aviation inspired by recent global conflicts.</p>

          <p>The Labubu doll, a small, monster-like figurine from Chinese toy retailer Pop Mart, has become a global phenomenon, particularly after being seen with celebrities like Rihanna. The dolls, sold in "blind boxes" that add to the thrill of collecting, have been described as a form of "social currency," creating an in-group for those who follow the trend. Despite recent price increases and difficulties in purchasing due to high demand and measures against resellers, the craze shows no signs of slowing down. Fans and collectors continue to gather at events and participate in online communities, fueled by the hype and the joy of unboxing.</p>

This will be the fourth round of subsidies this year, bringing the annual total to the targeted 300 billion yuan. The country's trade-in program has already generated over 1.7 trillion yuan in sales in 2025, with a notable 40.3% year-on-year increase in new energy vehicle sales. These efforts come as national retail sales grew by 5% in the first half of the year, indicating a strengthening consumer market. (not investment advice)</p>

Founded by a former construction contractor, the company's technology analyzes millions of unstructured documents like blueprints and schedules to identify discrepancies and streamline workflows. This automation helps prevent costly rework and reduces the administrative burden in an industry that has been slow to digitize. The platform aims to address the nearly $1 trillion in lost productivity the sector faces annually due to inefficiencies and outdated processes.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer recounts her experience moving to Los Angeles and embracing a solo polyamorous, queer identity after the end of a monogamous relationship. She describes connecting with a partnered woman on a dating app who, along with her wife, introduces her to the local lesbian scene and a community of ethically non-monogamous people. Through these new relationships, which are joyful, shared, and expansive, the author finds a sense of belonging and authenticity she had been seeking. The experience reshapes her understanding of stability, which she now defines by honesty and community rather than exclusivity.</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, has persevered through the city's economic booms and busts by staying true to its Arts and Crafts roots.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has begun selling its first-ever assigned seats for flights starting next year, with prices varying based on route, travel date, and seat location. A sample roundtrip flight during a holiday weekend showed extra-legroom seats costing up to $96 each way, while preferred seats were priced around $41-$46. This shift away from its long-standing open-seating model is part of a broader strategy to increase revenue, following pressure from investors. The airline has also introduced bag fees and a basic economy fare, aligning its business model more closely with its industry rivals.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, even as net income fell 23% year-over-year to $7.1 billion.

The oil major achieved its highest second-quarter output since the Exxon and Mobil merger, pumping 4.6 million barrels per day. The company continues to focus on cost-cutting and shareholder returns, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

The congested schedule, which also includes expanded UEFA competitions, has already led to the scrapping of FA Cup replays.

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the trade of precious metals and gems, a sector previously exploited as a loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) to the country's financial crime watchdog within five days. This is China's first such regulation to expand supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector. The move aims to close a significant gap in the country's efforts to prevent illicit financial flows and enhance compliance with international anti-money-laundering standards.

This shift from informal "handshake agreements" has boosted total compensation, with median pay for CEOs at larger firms exceeding $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity, reflecting a growing formalization in this exclusive corner of the wealth management industry.

          <p>The European Union will begin replacing manual passport stamping with a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES) on October 12. Under the new system, non-EU travelers, including those from the U.K., will need to have their fingerprints and facial images scanned to cross an EU border. This digital record will be valid for three years, aiming to tighten security and eventually speed up border crossings. The scheme will be rolled out over six months, but governments have warned travelers to be prepared for potential delays during the initial implementation phase as the new checks are introduced.</p>
