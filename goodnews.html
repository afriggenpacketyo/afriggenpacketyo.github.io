          <p>Following two days of negotiations in Geneva, the White House announced a trade deal with China, though specifics remain unclear, while Chinese officials described it as reaching an 'important consensus'. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged 'substantial progress' but deferred details to a joint statement. The talks aimed to de-escalate the ongoing trade war triggered by increased tariffs from both sides. China indicated a willingness to establish a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues, emphasizing a desire for win-win outcomes. The potential deal could provide relief to the global economy, which has been impacted by trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, though Qatari officials dispute that the plane will be gifted during Trump's upcoming trip. The plane needs to undergo security checks before it can be accepted and is intended for the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the potential ethics violations of accepting such a gift. The trip will focus on strengthening ties between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister has announced plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system with stricter visa rules, including tightened English tests for applicants and their adult dependents. Most migrants will need to wait ten years before applying for settled status, instead of five, with a fast-track option for skilled workers in high-demand sectors. The changes aim to create a controlled, selective, and fair system, though critics warn they could split families. The government also plans to end care worker recruitment from overseas, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of existing overseas workers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a trade deal with China following a meeting between top officials in Geneva, Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the talks were 'productive' but did not provide specific details, promising more information on Monday. China was the biggest target, raising tariff rates to 145% on all goods imported from the Asian country with the exception of electronic goods such as semiconductors. China responded with reciprocal tariffs of 125% on most American goods, effectively starting a trade war that has led to a significant reduction of goods shipped to the U.S.</p>
