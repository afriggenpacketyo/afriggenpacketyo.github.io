The article also draws parallels between Cassian Andor, the main character, and revolutionary figures from Latin American history. The author argues that "Andor" serves as a reminder of the struggles for liberation and offers a template for confronting contemporary issues. </p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is considering implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into weather forecasting to enhance accuracy through deep learning. A new team was established in April to combine AI predictions based on historical weather data with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system would analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and generate forecasts for temperature, rainfall, and typhoon paths. While AI will play a significant role, human forecasters will still oversee the process and issue final reports. </p>

The Daily Express reports the prime minister has "opened the door" to a U-turn on cuts to the winter fuel payments, following a "backlash" from pensioners. Parking fines could "rocket" by 75%, the Daily Mail declares, in what the paper says would be a "major blow" for millions of "hard-pressed" motorists. </p>

          <p>A state environmental oversight board voted unanimously to rescind a controversial proposal that would have permitted California municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil that is currently required to be dumped at sites specifically designated and approved for hazardous waste. Environmental advocates and community members expressed concerns that the rollback could result in toxic dust blowing into communities near local landfills or dangerous chemicals leaching into groundwater. Heavily polluting industries have tainted soil across California. More than 560,000 tons of hazardous soil are produced each year in California as environmental regulators endeavor to prevent residents from coming in contact with chemical-laced soil and developers build on land in industrial corridors. </p>
