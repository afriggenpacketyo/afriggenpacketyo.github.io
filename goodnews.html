          <p>Actor Ty Burrell, known for his role as Phil Dunphy on "Modern Family," has expressed no regrets about leaving Los Angeles for a quieter life in Salt Lake City, Utah. He moved with his wife and daughters after the show concluded, embracing an outdoorsy lifestyle that he didn't experience growing up. While he is open to returning to acting, he currently focuses on voiceover work, which allows more family time. Several of his "Modern Family" co-stars, including Ariel Winter and Eric Stonestreet, have also relocated from Hollywood, citing desires for a more normal life and to escape the pressures of stardom.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian institution has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments in its National Museum for American History exhibit in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears of historical whitewashing. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any political pressure, explaining the placard was removed because it did not meet the museum's presentation standards. The section on presidential power limits already includes materials on the impeachments of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, and the new display will bring Trump's impeachments back into this historical context.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix after a tense battle with his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished second. Norris executed a bold one-stop strategy, which required a masterful defensive drive in the final laps to hold off Piastri's charge on fresher tires. George Russell of Mercedes claimed the final podium spot, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who started on pole, faded to fourth. The victory narrows the gap between Norris and Piastri in the championship standings as Formula 1 heads into its summer break, marking a significant result for both the driver and the McLaren team.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is part of a wider $19 billion airport overhaul and is designed specifically for international travelers with a focus on natural light and efficiency. Upon full completion in 2030, it will feature 23 gates, over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining space, and a resilient microgrid for independent power. The project aims to modernize the aging infrastructure of one of the nation's busiest hubs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering a compensation scheme for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans, which could cost between £9 billion and £18 billion. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, deemed exceptionally large commissions to be unfair. The proposed scheme would address these unfair cases, with the FCA estimating that most eligible individuals might receive under £950. The regulator is now consulting on the details of the scheme, which aims to provide clarity and a path for redress for affected consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce attorneys advise that individuals in a rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances, even without a prenuptial agreement. One key recommendation is to ensure full transparency and access to all joint financial information, including accounts, assets, and liabilities, while still married. This proactive approach prevents being locked out of accounts and provides a clear financial picture if a divorce proceeds. Another protective measure is a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided. These steps can provide security and clarity for both parties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert in conscious parenting suggests that instead of punishing or trying to control a child's tantrum, parents should focus on connection and validation to help soothe them. The article outlines seven calming phrases, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you," and "Your feelings make sense." This approach is designed to make a child feel safe and understood, which helps their nervous system regulate more quickly. By reassuring the child and setting compassionate boundaries without shame, parents can de-escalate outbursts and teach their children healthier ways to process and express their emotions over time.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it is working "at pace" on a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in the country. While a small number of children have been brought to the UK through private initiatives, this would be the first government-led medical evacuation scheme of the conflict. The plan, which could be operational within weeks and may involve up to 300 children, follows a Foreign Affairs Committee report that criticized the government's previous inaction. The move is a response to the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where many children have been killed or injured.</p>

The philosophy emphasizes prioritizing life experiences over material consumption. Adherents focus on defining what is "enough" for a happy life, thereby liberating their time from the traditional career path to pursue personal passions and family life. (not investment advice)</p>
