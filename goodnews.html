          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of approximately 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after their controversial deployment. The troops were sent by President Trump, against the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, to address protests related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions. While the Pentagon cited subsiding lawlessness, Newsom criticized the deployment as political maneuvering and called for the remaining forces to be sent home as well. The move signals a de-escalation of federal presence in the city.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets, with the country reportedly agreeing to lower its own tariffs on American products. As part of the deal, Indonesia has also committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural goods, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This agreement is the latest in a series of trade negotiations initiated by the White House after threatening widespread tariffs earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump, alongside tech and energy leaders, announced over $90 billion in new investments for Pennsylvania. The initiatives aim to establish a new artificial intelligence economy in the state, leveraging its energy resources like natural gas and nuclear power. Key projects include building new data centers to meet AI's high energy demands and an innovation center for workforce training. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event also highlighted a major partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, with organizers hoping it marks the beginning of Pittsburgh's transformation into a national AI hub.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at creating a pathway to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants. The legislation, co-sponsored by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), would establish a seven-year "Dignity Program" for those who have been in the U.S. for at least five years. Participants would need to pass background checks and pay restitution to gain legal work authority. The bill also includes provisions for increased border security funding and reforms to the asylum and visa systems.</p>

          <p>At an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh, Westinghouse interim CEO Dan Sumner announced a plan to build 10 new AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction to start by 2030. Each large reactor can power over 750,000 homes, representing a massive expansion of U.S. nuclear capacity. The announcement aligns with President Trump's executive orders aiming to quadruple the nation's nuclear power by 2050. This ambitious plan follows the completion of the only two new U.S. reactors in 30 years at Plant Vogtle, a project that also involved Westinghouse AP1000s.</p>

          <p>Tony Gilroy, creator of the "Star Wars" series "Andor," reflected on the show's 14 Emmy nominations, calling the project the "seminal creative experience" of his life.

In an interview, Gilroy discussed the satisfaction of seeing the show's cast and crew recognized and commented on the "spooky" experience of watching current events mirror the show's themes of rebellion and political turmoil. He noted that while the show was inspired by historical revolutions, its contemporary relevance has been unexpectedly striking.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, which shield migrants from deportation and provide work permits, arguing the situation in Afghanistan had improved. However, immigrant advocacy groups sued, and the court has paused the termination for one week to allow for legal briefings. The move provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program, which was implemented after the Taliban's takeover in 2021.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to Whoop, alleging the company is marketing its new "Blood Pressure Insights" feature as a medical device without proper regulatory approval. The FDA contends that the feature, which provides users with estimated blood pressure ranges, is intended for diagnosis or treatment of disease and therefore requires rigorous testing. Whoop has pushed back, arguing the FDA is "overstepping its authority" by trying to regulate a non-medical wellness tool. The company has 15 days to respond to the agency's concerns.</p>
