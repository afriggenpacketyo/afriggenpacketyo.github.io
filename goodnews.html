        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Industries Corp. experienced a significant stock decline after the Toyota Group revealed a 4.7 trillion yen ($33 billion) deal to privatize the company. The offer includes a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries shares at 16,300 yen apiece, which is lower than the previous day's price. This move is part of a broader trend in Japan where firms are facing pressure to unwind cross-shareholding ties, and the investment from Akio Toyoda is seen as symbolic to enhance group unity. Despite the special committee requesting a higher offer price, the offeror rebuffed, leading some analysts to view the deal as unattractive. Optimism that this deal will benefit Toyota overall is tempered by concerns about the offer's fairness to Toyota Industries shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece challenges the widely held belief that the "China shock" caused significant job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector. While acknowledging the decline in regional manufacturing, the author argues that cheap Chinese goods have made life more affordable for the average American. The piece references research by economists like David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson, who have studied the labor market adjustments to trade with China. The author suggests that the narrative of mass job losses due to Chinese competition may be overstated.</p>
