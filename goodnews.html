          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members safely deplaned via emergency slides after smoke was seen billowing from under the aircraft. The airline later confirmed the issue was related to a tire, and the Denver Fire Department extinguished a small fire. Five people were evaluated for minor injuries at the scene, with one transported for further medical attention, and passengers were rebooked on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a seismoscope reportedly invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat that has led some modern scholars to dismiss it as a legend. Despite its removal from the Chinese school curriculum, scientists are now using modern techniques and new clues to restore the ancient wonder. The goal is to validate the historical accounts of a device that was said to be "as accurate as the gods."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, marking the occasion with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the postal service played a crucial role in unifying the young nation. The new stamps feature Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general, and depictions of a postal worker through the seasons. The celebration comes amid recent discussions about the agency's future, including potential privatization, though the current postmaster general has stated his opposition to such a move.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis came as a relief, as a more severe injury could have resulted in a long-term absence for the star player. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks. He hopes to initially return to the lineup as a designated hitter once the strain has healed.</p>

          <p>A look back at the early 2000s MTV show "The Osbournes" highlights its groundbreaking role in creating the "reality sitcom" genre. The series, which followed the daily life of rock star Ozzy Osbourne and his family, blended mundane domestic situations with their spectacular fame, winning an Emmy and paving the way for shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." Producers describe it as an experiment that captured a surprisingly normal, albeit chaotic, family dynamic that resonated with millions of viewers. The show's success redefined reality television by focusing on the personal lives of celebrities in a way that had not been seen before.</p>

Despite threats and increasing offers of money, he stood by his principles, an act the Church has declared a martyrdom. Last month, he was beatified, a key step toward canonization, and his story of integrity is now being held up by the Pope as an example for young people to resist corruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain why watching high-stakes football matches can produce such strong physical and emotional reactions in fans. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, is activated as if the fan is participating in the game, leading to an increased heart rate and heightened senses. Experts advise fans to manage this stress by getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for a rare and healthy expression of emotion.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. Climatologists warn that despite the cold start, the Bay Area's hottest months are often September and October, so a heatwave is still possible.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to offer greater protection to pubs and live music venues from noise complaints made by residents of new nearby developments. Under the proposed changes, developers would be responsible for soundproofing new buildings, and processes for expanding outdoor areas would be streamlined. The government hopes these reforms will bring vibrancy back to struggling town centers and make it easier to open new hospitality businesses in disused shops. The move comes after several popular venues faced closure threats due to legal battles over noise levels.</p>
