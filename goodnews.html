          <p>Zara's parent company, Inditex, announced weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and indicated a slower start to the summer season due to broader economic uncertainties. The Spanish retailer's revenue for the fiscal first quarter was slightly below analyst forecasts, and summer sales growth decelerated compared to the previous year. Inditex, which owns brands like Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti, is considered a barometer for consumer sentiment and spending habits, and the company is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., its second-largest market. The company stated that the current environment is difficult to predict. The overall market sentiment is showing some signs of instability. </p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender track and field athlete, won two first-place medals at the California state championships and responded to the ensuing controversy with indifference. Hernandez, a Jurupa Valley High School athlete, became a focal point in the debate surrounding transgender athletes' participation in high school sports, drawing criticism and legal challenges. The California Interscholastic Federation adjusted its rules to allow biological females to receive first-place medals if displaced by a transgender athlete. Hernandez stated that the protests were "weird" and affirmed the intention to continue competing without backing down, focusing on personal performance rather than external criticism.

          <p>Mortgage application volume increased by 12.5% last week, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, and this surge is attributed to adjustments following the Memorial Day holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances slightly increased to 6.93%, while rates for 15-year fixed loans and Federal Housing Administration loans saw a slight decrease. The increase in purchase applications is partly attributed to a rise in available listings, with supply up about 31% compared to last year, and homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on the increased housing inventory. New monthly inflation data and trade talks with China are expected to influence bond markets. </p>

          <p>The article explores the cultural prioritization of romantic relationships over friendships, examining how society often undervalues platonic bonds. It references a study indicating that people lose close friendships when they enter romantic relationships, and it highlights the historical context where friendships were once as significant as romantic partnerships. The piece suggests that placing excessive pressure on romantic partners to fulfill all emotional needs can strain those relationships, and it advocates for prioritizing both love and friendship. It proposes that individuals should be intentional about nurturing friendships and recognize their distinct value. The author makes a case for a more balanced approach to relationships.</p>

Rodgers expressed a desire to give back to the game, share his knowledge with teammates, and help lead the team, and he hopes to have some of the Steelers' skill position players join him in California before training camp.

          <p>France is considering a ban on outdoor smoking, raising questions about whether the country can maintain its identity without cigarettes. The author reflects on personal experiences of learning to smoke in Paris and the cultural significance of smoking in French society.

While acknowledging the health risks of smoking, the author expresses nostalgia for the quality of time and the sense of pause that cigarettes once provided. The author contemplates the impact of the ban on French culture and its traditions of leisure and enjoyment.</p>

WhatsApp has applied to submit evidence to the court, and this intervention represents a major escalation in the dispute between the UK and the US.

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025, with over 2.2 million electrified vehicles registered from January to April, marking a 20% surge compared to the same period in 2024. This recovery offers relief to Europe's automotive industry, which has been grappling with rising production costs and competition from Chinese EV manufacturers. The primary driver of the rebound is attributed to an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15% from 2021 levels, and the transition remains patchy across Europe, with some countries lagging behind. Consumer skepticism about EVs and charging infrastructure remain critical barriers to widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>A court ruling ordering the Tokyo government and the state to compensate a company president and others for an unlawful investigation over a suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment has been finalized, with the parties giving up on appealing. The Tokyo High Court's May 28 ruling awarded Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two other men about 166 million yen in damages, and recognized their arrests and indictments as illegal. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation of the case, which involved the export of spray-drying apparatus that investigators suspected could be used in the process of making biological weapons. The case has concluded.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has expressed increasing optimism about quantum computing, anticipating that it will begin to solve real-world problems in the coming years. During his keynote speech at Nvidia's GTC Paris developer conference, Huang declared that "Quantum computing is reaching an inflection point." Quantum computers use quantum bits, or "qubits," to process larger volumes of data, facilitating breakthroughs in medicine, science, and finance. The quantum computing space has garnered investor attention, with stocks like Rigetti Computing and IonQ experiencing growth. The future of quantum computing is becoming more tangible.</p>

          <p>Spain record goalscorer Jenni Hermoso has been left out of their squad for the upcoming European Championships in Switzerland, despite scoring 57 goals in 123 appearances for her national side and playing a key role in Spain's World Cup victory in 2023. Head coach Montse Tome cited performance assessments and competition in her position as reasons for the omission. Hermoso was kissed by Spain's former football federation boss Luis Rubiales without her consent, and Rubiales was later found guilty of sexual assault. Spain's Euro squad includes two-time Ballon d'Or winners Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati. The team is strong.</p>

          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a record funding round to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. The Series A financing round was co-led by investors Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, and the company's CEO described nuclear fusion as the "ultimate" source of clean energy. If nuclear fusion can be replicated at an industrial scale, the International Atomic Energy Agency says the technology could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy that meets the world's demand. The company has a positive outlook.</p>
