Pitt jokingly expresses lingering bitterness over Cruise's victory, mentioning Cruise "pitted" him on the last corner. When asked about the possibility of working with Cruise again, Pitt playfully states he would consider it if he doesn't have to perform dangerous stunts like hanging from biplanes. Pitt also discussed his upcoming film, "F1: The Movie," where he enjoyed driving at high speeds, and reflected on the importance of surrounding himself with loved ones as he gets older.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 67% of newlyweds incurred debt to finance their weddings, prompting financial experts to offer advice on wiser borrowing strategies. While paying in cash is the ideal option, using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer can be a savvy approach if the debt is repaid within the promotional period. Personal lines of credit may also be suitable for larger expenses due to potentially lower interest rates. Experts stress the importance of planning for loan repayment to avoid financial strain after the wedding.</p>

          <p>A new proposal in California aims to require all local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to show their faces and be identifiable by their uniform. The bill, introduced by State Sens. Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, seeks to increase transparency and public trust in law enforcement. Officers who cover their faces while conducting official business could face a misdemeanor charge under the proposal. The senators cited recent instances of federal officers conducting raids while covering their faces and badges as a cause for concern.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary block on President Trump's policy that would prohibit foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S., pending further consideration. Harvard's lawyers argue that the policy violates First Amendment rights and exceeds the executive branch's authority, claiming it's retaliatory and discriminatory. The government argues that it doesn't "trust" Harvard to monitor foreign students and raised concerns about the university's "foreign entanglements." The judge questioned the government's rationale, noting that the concerns likely extend beyond Harvard.</p>
