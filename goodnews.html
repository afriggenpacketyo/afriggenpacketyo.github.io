        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black sees Europe aiming to secure an away victory, a feat not achieved since 2012. Key factors for success include a strong start in Friday's foursomes, which have historically set the tone, and effectively managing the notoriously boisterous New York crowd. European captain Luke Donald's calm leadership and experienced team contrast with US captain Keegan Bradley's more cluttered preparations and gaffes. With veterans like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose leading Europe, and Scottie Scheffler as the US standout, the competition is poised to be intense, potentially influenced by former President Donald Trump's presence.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized the need to prevent South China Sea disputes from defining the broader relationship with China during the farewell for Beijing's envoy. Marcos advocated for continued deepening of trade, cultural, and people-to-people interactions between the two nations. The Chinese embassy's statement affirmed this perspective, expressing a desire for Manila to work towards restoring bilateral ties. This diplomatic gesture reflects a mutual effort to de-escalate rhetoric and focus on other aspects of the relationship, despite persistent territorial disagreements in the region.

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's public irritation with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham highlights the party's internal struggles as it confronts the rising influence of Reform UK. Starmer, set to address global centre-left leaders, plans to emphasize a "politics of patriotic renewal" against what he calls "predatory grievance." The article suggests Burnham's consistent critiques, implying a lack of clear direction from Downing Street, have deeply irked the Prime Minister. Comparing Burnham's economic prospectus to Liz Truss's disastrous policies underscores the severity of Starmer's concern, revealing the intense internal dynamics within Labour as they seek to define their vision.</p>

          <h2>BP's Improved Performance Reduces Takeover Speculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 01:09:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy major BP has significantly improved its financial standing, leading to a decrease in takeover speculation that previously positioned it as a prime acquisition target. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since early April, outperforming rivals, driven by a strategic reset, leadership changes, cost-cutting success, and recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized BP's focus on growth to boost shareholder value, while British rival Shell denied earlier reports of acquisition talks. Analysts attribute the positive shift to stronger second-quarter results and the appointment of a new chair with a track record of successful turnarounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On "The Wayne Rooney Show" podcast, former England captain Wayne Rooney recounted a series of unusual and often humorous experiences from his football career's away matches. He detailed instances of external disruptions, such as fireworks exploding directly above his hotel room, and bizarre internal issues like a Sunderland dressing room being flooded by leaking toilets from an upper floor. Rooney also highlighted the stark temperature differences in various club changing rooms, with Chelsea often being stiflingly hot and Anfield notoriously cold. The article also touched upon the emotional challenge of returning to his former club, Everton, where the anticipated hostile reception even deterred his father from attending.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the popular Labubu monster toy, is reportedly pleased with the recent drop in its secondary market resale prices. While Labubu previously commanded markups of over 2,000%, Pop Mart aims for its art toys to be accessible to genuine fans, not just for profit-driven scalpers. The company increased production tenfold to meet demand, contributing to the price decline, which analysts also link to cooling demand in mainland China. The article highlights Pop Mart's pivot towards a more sustainable model, expanding globally and investing in original animation, to avoid being a "one-hit wonder" and alienating core customers.

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, clarified that pregnant women should take Tylenol if advised by a doctor, especially for high fevers. This statement counters President Trump's recent comments suggesting pregnant women avoid the painkiller due to an alleged link to autism, which medical experts dispute. While the FDA Commissioner Marty Makary noted an "association" but not a "causal relationship," the medical community fears patients might turn to unsafe alternatives. Dr. Oz emphasized consulting physicians and expressed personal caution regarding unnecessary acetaminophen use during pregnancy, advocating for transparency in health advice.</p>

          <p>China is set to open the Huajiang Grand Canyon Bridge in its mountainous southwestern Guizhou province, which state media describes as the world's highest bridge. Rising 625 meters (2,050 feet) from the river below, its deck is comparable in height to the Shanghai Tower, surpassing the previous record holder, Duge Bridge. The structure will also be the world's longest mountain bridge, spanning 2,890 meters in total, with a main span of 1,420 meters. This engineering marvel, crossing the deep "Earth's crack" gorge, further solidifies Guizhou's reputation as home to nearly half of the world's tallest bridges.</p>
