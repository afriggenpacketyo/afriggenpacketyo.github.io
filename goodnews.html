          <p>Chinese officials are emphasizing a recently enacted law designed to support the country's private economy, viewing it as a critical component for growth. The law aims to address challenges faced by private enterprises, including fair competition, market access, financial support, and legal protections. China's vice-minister of justice, Wang Zhenjiang, stated that the legislation is expected to stimulate internal momentum and creative vitality within the private sector, particularly as China focuses on domestic economic drivers amidst ongoing trade disputes with the United States. The law formally defines the legal status of the private economy and government support for the first time.</p>

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recently denounced attacks on the judiciary, highlighting increased threats and professional retaliation faced by judges.</p>

Boise's mayor, Lauren McLean, issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag. These actions serve as a direct reaction to measures in Utah and Idaho restricting the types of flags that can be flown on government property.</p>
