          <p>Asia-Pacific markets presented a mixed picture as investors evaluated Japan's latest trade data and the inauguration of its new political leadership, including the country's first female finance minister. Japanese exports rose 4.2% year-on-year, primarily due to strong growth in Asia, which helped to partially offset a decline in shipments to the U.S. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi index notably achieved a new closing record, marking its sixth consecutive winning session, influenced by significant corporate movements like LG Chem's stock surge.

          <p>British lender Barclays has upgraded its full-year financial guidance and announced a surprise £500 million ($667 million) share buyback, with plans to move to quarterly announcements. The bank now expects a Return on Tangible Equity greater than 11% and net interest income exceeding £12.6 billion for the year. Despite third-quarter pre-tax profit falling 7% below expectations, primarily due to a £235 million charge from the UK's car loans scandal, the investment banking division saw an 8% income increase. This strong investment banking performance has been instrumental in driving European financial stocks upward, with Barclays shares surging over 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is experiencing significant engineering hurdles that have pushed the potential launch of its foldable 18-inch iPad, internally codenamed J312, to 2029 or beyond. The company had initially targeted a 2028 release for this device, which is projected to cost around $3,000. Key challenges involve managing the device's weight, integrating desired features, and perfecting the complex and expensive 18-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology. This foldable tablet, resembling a Mac laptop when closed, is part of Apple's broader initiative to bring more innovative products to market, but its development illustrates the difficulties in pioneering new form factors.</p>

          <p>A landmark study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has, for the first time, systematically ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, uncovering substantial differences between drugs. The research, which analyzed 30 commonly used medications over an eight-week period, revealed impacts such as weight changes of up to 2kg and heart rate variations of as much as 21 beats per minute. Academics stress the clinical importance of these findings, advocating for a more personalized approach to treatment. This article suggests that antidepressants should be closely matched to individual patient needs and existing health conditions, moving beyond a "one-size-fits-all" prescribing model.</p>

          <p>India and the U.S. are reportedly nearing a significant trade agreement that could involve Washington substantially reducing tariffs on Indian exports, potentially from 50% to 15-16%. Concurrently, India is considering increasing its import quota for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S. This progress comes as U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him of New Delhi's intention to scale back Russian oil purchases. While Modi confirmed a phone call with Trump, his public statement focused on unity against terrorism, omitting any mention of Russian oil.

          <p>Netflix has declared itself "all in" on leveraging generative artificial intelligence across its streaming platform, identifying it as a "significant opportunity" to enhance various business functions. The company's recent earnings report underscored AI's role in refining title recommendations, bolstering its advertising operations, and supporting the creation of movies and TV content. Specific applications include using generative AI for de-aging characters in the film "Happy Gilmore 2" and assisting producers with wardrobe and set designs for the series "Billionaires' Bunker." While CEO Ted Sarandos asserts AI will augment storytelling without supplanting human creativity, concerns about job displacement and the ethical use of human-made content continue to resonate within the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral candidates are gearing up for their final debate, with Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani striving to maintain control of the race. Independent candidate, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, is aggressively urging Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out, contending that Sliwa's participation guarantees a Mamdani win. Cuomo aims to appeal to conservative and moderate voters by framing himself as a more viable option. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is anticipated to focus on local issues and deflect opponents' broadsides, while Sliwa remains steadfast in his campaign, seeking to transform his growing public profile into tangible voter support in the heavily Democratic city.</p>

The absence of LeBron James, who missed his first career season opener due to a sciatica injury, underscored the team's challenge. Coach JJ Redick highlighted the Lakers' struggles with 19 turnovers and a consistent "terrible third-quarter" trend that doomed them. While Austin Reaves contributed 26 points, the team's overall lack of offensive cohesion and depth proved insufficient against the Warriors, who had four players scoring in double-figures.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has prohibited gambling advertisements from Kwiff and Betway that prominently featured Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. The bans were imposed due to valid concerns that these ads held a strong appeal to individuals under the age of 18, thus contravening established advertising regulations. Kwiff's post on X promoted the British Grand Prix with Hamilton's image, while Betway's YouTube advert displayed football fans wearing Chelsea badges. This article underscores the regulatory body's commitment to safeguarding minors from gambling influences, citing Hamilton's substantial social media presence among under-18s and his involvement in child-rated media.</p>
