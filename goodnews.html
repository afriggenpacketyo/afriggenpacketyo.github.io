While some experts caution that the relationship between people involved is important for touch to be beneficial, Wood stresses the importance of consent and boundaries in her practice.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks, sparking outrage and protests. A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing potential violations of her due process and First Amendment rights, particularly regarding an op-ed she co-authored on Israel's war with Hamas. At a news conference, Ozturk thanked her community for their support, while Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed her home and vowed to continue fighting for her exoneration. The Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with a court order to transfer Ozturk to Vermont.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amid sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but increased transaction volume, attributed to efforts to defend market share. However, analysts note the importance of monitoring expansion beyond wealthier cities, and a large number of coffee shops have opened in second-tier cities. These trends suggest a shift in the coffee market towards broader accessibility and affordability in China.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the shift in Chinese consumer behavior towards favoring domestic brands amid rising global protectionism and technological rivalry. Consumption in China is becoming an emotional and cultural act, reflecting identity, confidence, and aspiration, and buying local is now a statement of resilience and national pride. Younger generations increasingly view domestic brands as markers of cultural identity and creative ambition, and market data underscores this trend, particularly in technology, fashion, and consumer goods. This shift reflects a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation and participate in shaping a confident national identity.</p>

This event is unusual because atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., but it may help alleviate recent droughts in certain areas of Florida.

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs, and President Trump claimed "great progress" was made, negotiating a "total reset." While there was no immediate confirmation of progress, the talks, which could help stabilize world markets, will resume Sunday. Previous to the meeting, initial discussions were likely about de-escalation, as high tariffs are unsustainable, and officials pushed the Trump administration to drop unilateral tariffs. The U.S. has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with a 125% levy.</p>
