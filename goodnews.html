          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha lauded the new Champions League format, emphasizing the exciting and unpredictable nature of the group stage. He highlighted that teams played each other only once, reducing the pressure of individual results and allowing lesser teams to compete with more energy. Journalist Nicky Bandini noted that the format benefitted PSG, allowing them to develop throughout the season, ultimately leading to their victory. The new format allowed for real-time observation of team development and the importance of finding form at the right time, as PSG demonstrated. The article suggests the format's success lies in its ability to foster competitive balance and provide opportunities for teams to evolve throughout the tournament.</p>
