          <p>Nippon Steel has finalized its $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, which includes an agreement granting the US government veto power over key corporate decisions. The deal, initially blocked by President Biden due to national security concerns, was restructured with the Trump administration's involvement to allow greater US government control. The agreement includes the authority for the US President to name a board member and a "golden share" that gives the US government veto authority over corporate decisions that could affect US jobs. This acquisition gives Nippon Steel further access into the growing U.S. market for high-grade steel. </p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. has finalized an agreement to make United States Steel Corp. its wholly-owned unit, with U.S. President Donald Trump reversing his initial opposition to clear the way for the deal.

As part of the agreement, the U.S. government will retain a "golden share," enabling it to veto significant management decisions. This move ensures the U.S. government maintains oversight over key aspects of U.S. Steel's operations despite foreign ownership.</p>

          <p>This article explores the life and career of Desi Arnaz, focusing on his pivotal role in revolutionizing the television industry. Arnaz, along with Lucille Ball, created "I Love Lucy," a show filmed on 35mm film, which enabled reruns and syndication, fundamentally changing television economics. The show was also created to save their marriage, as Lucy wanted Desi to be with her in California. Despite facing skepticism from CBS, Arnaz insisted on owning the rights to the show, a gamble that paid off immensely. Beyond his on-screen persona, Arnaz's innovations at Desilu Studios cemented his legacy as a visionary in television production.</p>

It also underscores his foresight in preserving episodes on 35mm film, leading to the creation of reruns and syndication.

          <p>The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, has canceled her planned appearance at Royal Ascot as she continues her recovery from cancer. She has been gradually returning to public duties since completing chemotherapy last fall, balancing her public responsibilities with her health needs. While Prince William attended the event, awarding race prizes, Kate's absence was noted, though she had appeared publicly at Trooping the Color and the Order of the Garter service recently. The royal family has not disclosed the specific type of cancer she is being treated for, but her focus remains on staying cancer-free.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits decreased to 245,000 last week, remaining near historically low levels.

Despite the overall low levels, recent weeks have seen claims at the higher end of the range, indicating a potential deceleration in the U.S. job market.

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to reach 30C (86F) in some areas, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. The Met Office requires temperatures to reach a threshold for at least three consecutive days to declare a heatwave, and that threshold varies from 25C across the north and west of the UK, to 28C in parts of eastern England. The warm weather is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot air from Western Europe. A recent Met Office study indicates a rapidly increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK, driven by climate change.</p>
