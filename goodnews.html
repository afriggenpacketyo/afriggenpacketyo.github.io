          <h2>Health Experts Analyze Nutritional Differences Between Cane Sugar and High-Fructose Corn Syrup</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 12:57:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following former President Trump's announcement about Coca-Cola potentially switching to cane sugar, health experts are weighing in on the differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. While cane sugar is less processed, both sweeteners have similar calorie counts and impact on blood sugar levels. Experts note that high-fructose corn syrup's slightly higher fructose content is linked to health issues like Type 2 diabetes and liver disease, and may cause more inflammation. Ultimately, dietitians emphasize that moderation is key, as excessive consumption of any added sugar is detrimental to health.</p>

          <p>The Washington Commanders are reportedly strengthening their defense by agreeing to a one-year contract with veteran pass rusher Von Miller. Miller, the NFL's active leader in career sacks, was recently released by the Buffalo Bills. Despite a recent decline in performance following an ACL injury, the 36-year-old is expected to provide a significant boost and veteran leadership to the Commanders' defensive line. This move is part of an active offseason for Washington, which has also made key acquisitions on offense to support rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a significant bill to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, after a rebellion by right-wing Republicans temporarily halted its progress. The conservatives initially blocked the bill, seeking to merge it with other measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. A deal was eventually reached to advance the legislation, which would be the first major crypto bill passed by Congress. The bill has faced criticism from some Democrats over consumer protection and potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto investments.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of charisma, defining it as a combination of influence and affability that makes individuals magnetic and persuasive. While some aspects of charisma may be innate, linked to attractiveness, intelligence, and extroversion, evidence suggests it can also be learned. Studies show that training in nonverbal communication, such as emphatic gestures and warm expressions, can measurably increase a person's perceived charisma. However, the article also notes a potential downside, as extremely high charisma can be linked to narcissism and may be perceived as less effective in leadership roles.</p>

          <p>As a U.S.-EU trade dispute looms, this article fact-checks President Trump's claims that Europe does not buy American cars or agricultural products. Trade data from 2024 shows these assertions are inaccurate. The EU was the fourth-largest market for U.S. agricultural goods, purchasing a record $12.8 billion worth, including soybeans and nuts. Similarly, while the U.S. imports more European vehicles, the EU still purchased about 165,000 American-made cars in 2024. The analysis provides context on existing tariffs and other market factors that contribute to the trade imbalance in these sectors.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Too Much," Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, describing it as a pragmatic and unromantic take on modern relationships. The show follows Jess (Megan Stalter), an American who moves to London and enters a relationship with Felix (Will Sharpe), a broke musician. The review notes the characters' lack of on-screen chemistry, suggesting their bond is based on mutual need rather than passion, reflecting love in a precarious, cold climate. Comparing it to edgy British sitcoms like "Fleabag," the piece argues that the show intentionally subverts rom-com tropes to explore themes of security and emotional pragmatism.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer will begin selling their widely used blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to patients at a price over 40% lower than its list price.

The move comes amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices. However, the discounted price is still significantly higher than what commercially insured patients typically pay out-of-pocket and the price negotiated by Medicare, which is set to take effect next year.</p>

The move is a precautionary one ahead of the company's upcoming earnings report. The rationale is that while the company's long-term outlook is strong, its stock has run up significantly this year, creating high market expectations that could be difficult to meet. The sale is presented as a prudent profit-taking measure to mitigate the risk of a potential post-earnings dip if the results, however strong, fail to clear the lofty bar set by the market.

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act, which would unlock federal FEMA funding for affected communities. The move follows a deadly June heat dome and acknowledges that extreme heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, yet is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster. If passed, the bill would allow states to request federal aid for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. However, the bill faces Republican opposition and debate over whether current laws already allow for such declarations.</p>
