          <p>The White House has detailed a preliminary deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, placing its American operations under a new joint venture with a majority of U.S. investors and board members. Tech giant Oracle will audit and operate the app's recommendation algorithm, which will be retrained using only U.S. user data to address national security concerns. President Trump is expected to approve the framework, which extends the ban-or-sale deadline by 120 days to allow for finalization. This structure aims to secure the app's source code and data for its 170 million American users.</p>

The partnership aims to build and deploy systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to 4 to 5 million GPUs, to develop next-generation artificial intelligence. This collaboration underscores the deep interdependence between the two companies in driving the AI boom and signals the immense infrastructure required for future AI models.

          <p>Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has pardoned Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and blogger who had been imprisoned for six years. Abdel Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, was convicted of "spreading false news" in a trial widely criticized by human rights organizations. The pardon follows significant international pressure and a recent hunger strike by his mother, which drew global attention to his case. Human rights groups have expressed hope that this decision may signal a broader shift in the government's approach to political prisoners.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock is experiencing a significant surge following reports of stronger-than-expected demand for its new iPhone 17 models and the lightweight iPhone Air. T-Mobile announced its biggest iPhone sales week ever, with sales up double digits from the previous year, particularly for the higher-priced Pro models. This positive sales data prompted Wedbush to raise its Apple price target to $310, citing supply chain checks that suggest a 20% production increase. The robust demand indicates that the latest iPhone upgrade cycle has been underestimated by some market analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran Argues for Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran is advocating for substantial cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate, arguing that current monetary policy is overly restrictive. In a speech, Miran contended that policy changes under the Trump administration related to immigration, taxes, and deregulation are pushing down the "neutral" rate of interest. He believes this justifies lowering the federal funds rate by nearly two percentage points from its current level to avoid unnecessary layoffs. This stance places him at odds with the consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he recently dissented by voting for a larger rate cut.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance daily independence. By connecting to apps like "Be My Eyes," the glasses can link users with volunteers in real-time to help identify objects or read mail. The technology also features optical character recognition (OCR) that reads text aloud from menus, signs, and documents, providing crucial access to information. While acknowledging the technology is still a work in progress, advocates like the National Federation of the Blind see it as a meaningful step forward in accessibility.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest level in nearly three years. This reduction provides significant savings for borrowers, particularly those with large loans. For a $1 million mortgage, the current rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the 7.04% average rate seen in January 2025. Over the life of the loan, this difference could save a homeowner more than $200,000 in total interest costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire Metsera, a developer of obesity treatments, for up to $7.3 billion, signaling a major push into the lucrative weight-loss drug market. The acquisition comes after Pfizer faced setbacks with its own drug candidates and aims to compete with popular treatments from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Metsera's pipeline includes several promising oral and injectable drugs, including a potential once-monthly injectable that showed significant weight loss in early trials. This strategic move is intended to accelerate Pfizer's entry and strengthen its position in a market projected to be worth $100 billion by the 2030s.</p>

          <p>Germany's state-owned railway, Deutsche Bahn, has appointed Evelyn Palla as its new CEO to address a long-standing crisis of delays, cancellations, and deteriorating infrastructure. Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder acknowledged that previous punctuality targets were unachievable and set a new, more realistic goal of 70% on-time performance for long-distance trains by 2029. In July, over 40% of these trains were delayed. The government plans to invest billions from a special infrastructure fund to renovate dilapidated tracks and signal boxes, some of which date back to the 19th century.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire faced a potential cancellation due to a shortage of usable conkers caused by the UK's hottest summer on record. The hot, dry weather caused horse chestnuts to fall from trees prematurely and undersized. However, a nationwide appeal for help has been successful, with people from across the country offering to supply suitable nuts for the competition. Organizers are now confident the event will proceed, though they noted the conkers used this year will likely be smaller than average.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration may announce a link between Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism, numerous medical experts and organizations are refuting the claim. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship, emphasizing that untreated high fevers can pose risks to fetal development. Researchers point to large-scale studies, including one involving 2.5 million children, that found no association. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, also asserts that rigorous scientific research does not support a causal link between the medication and autism.</p>
