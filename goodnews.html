          <p>An 88-year-old woman in the Czech Republic, initially declared dead by a coroner after being found unresponsive, was discovered to be alive while being placed in a coffin. Morticians made the startling discovery, prompting an ambulance to transport her to the hospital. This rare medical occurrence, known as the Lazarus Effect, involves a person showing signs of life after being clinically pronounced dead. The Cleveland Clinic notes that this phenomenon typically occurs after CPR ends, and there have been 74 confirmed cases in the U.S. from 1982 to 2022. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Manhattan has extended an injunction preventing the Trump administration from canceling unspent funding for elementary and high schools in 16 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. The funding, totaling over $1.1 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act, is intended to help schools address the COVID-19 pandemic. Judge Edgardo Ramos's preliminary injunction directs the Department of Education to process funding requests without delay. New York Attorney General Letitia James led the lawsuit, arguing that the funds are essential for schools to recover from the pandemic. </p>

          <p>The USDA has temporarily paused its demand for sensitive data about people receiving federal food assistance (SNAP) from states. This decision comes after a lawsuit was filed alleging the directive violated federal privacy laws. The USDA had requested states turn over personal data of SNAP recipients, including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses. A USDA official stated the agency instructed EBT processors to refrain from sending data until procedural steps were completed. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs called the USDA's response a "temporary win," as federal privacy laws now apply to the data collection process. </p>
