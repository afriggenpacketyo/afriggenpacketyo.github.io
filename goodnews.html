          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:07:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, these ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The momentum was also supported by a broader tech stock rally and speculation about a more dovish future leadership at the Federal Reserve, which has historically been a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. This price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially enter the Indian market with the launch of an "Experience Center" showroom in Mumbai on July 15. This move marks the electric vehicle giant's first official presence in the country, with plans to begin direct sales to customers. The company faces challenges, including a 70% import duty on electric vehicles, though a reduced rate is available for companies that commit to local manufacturing. Tesla will compete with established players like China's BYD and local manufacturer Tata Motors as it begins its operations and recruitment efforts in India.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an advanced robot designed to automate the process of cotton topping, a crucial step in boosting crop yields. The machine, currently in pilot testing in Xinjiang, uses solid-state lidar and machine vision to precisely identify and remove the plant's top bud with a high-powered blue laser. This technology aims to overcome the inefficiencies and crop damage associated with manual methods. According to the development team from Xinjiang University, the robot has demonstrated 98.9% accuracy in bud detection and an 82% topping success rate with minimal plant damage.</p>

          <p>A German tourist, 26-year-old Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the remote Australian Outback. She was discovered in a fragile state on a forest trail by a member of the public, a day after her abandoned van was spotted from a police helicopter. Wilga was last seen on June 29 in Beacon, a small town northeast of Perth, and is believed to have become lost after her van got stuck in the mud. Authorities praised her resilience in surviving the hostile environment, which features challenging terrain and fauna.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant advancement in AI adoption on Wall Street. The AI agent is capable of completing complex, multi-step engineering tasks with minimal human intervention and is expected to join the firm's 12,000 human developers. Marco Argenti, Goldman's tech chief, stated that Devin will initially handle tasks like updating internal code, with the potential to scale to thousands of instances. This move to "agentic AI" signals a major shift toward a hybrid workforce where AI and humans collaborate, potentially boosting productivity significantly.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine through NATO, with the alliance set to reimburse the full cost. The decision follows a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for ten Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian missile and drone attacks. This move reverses a temporary halt on some critical weapon shipments to Kyiv, which had raised concerns about Ukraine's defensive capabilities. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also urged European allies to provide their existing Patriot batteries to expedite delivery.</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, a 224-foot embroidered cloth depicting the Norman Conquest of 1066, will be loaned to the United Kingdom for the first time in over 900 years. The historic artifact, believed to have been made in England shortly after the Battle of Hastings, will be displayed at the British Museum starting in September 2026. The loan was announced during a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, as the Bayeux museum in Normandy will be closing for renovations. In exchange, the British Museum will send several UK treasures to museums in Normandy.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a mysterious interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which they believe could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object detected visiting our solar system from interstellar space. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated from the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars. Made mostly of water ice, 3I/Atlas is expected to develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, and it should become visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

          <p>Iconiq Capital, a wealth management firm with high-profile clients like Mark Zuckerberg, is pioneering a new approach to philanthropy through collaborative funds called "co-labs." These funds pool clients' capital to make multiyear, unrestricted grants to nonprofits focused on specific causes, such as youth mental health or climate equity. The model aims to accelerate charitable giving by making it easier for busy, wealthy individuals to deploy their capital effectively without the bureaucracy of traditional foundations. This approach is seen as increasingly crucial as potential changes in tax policy and federal funding cuts place more pressure on the nonprofit sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have begun to lay down their arms, marking a significant step towards ending their 40-year armed insurgency against Turkey. A ceremony was held near Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan where thirty PKK fighters, including four commanders, symbolically destroyed their weapons. The move follows a call from a jailed PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to formally disband and disarm in favor of a political process. The PKK stated the voluntary action is a gesture of goodwill to advance a process of "peace and democratic society."</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new magnetic levitation (maglev) train capable of reaching speeds of 600 km/h (373 mph), offering a glimpse into the future of high-speed rail. Developed by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), the prototype was displayed at a modern railways exhibition. The train is intended to serve as a point-to-point transport tool between major cities, aiming to "fill the speed gap between high-speed rail and aviation." For instance, it could reduce the 1,200km journey between Beijing and Shanghai from 5.5 hours to just 2.5 hours once commercially operational.</p>

          <p>Three devout Muslim sisters from Buffalo, N.Y., have become catalysts for change in American women's wrestling by successfully advocating for rule changes allowing for modest uniforms. Jamilah, Zaynah, and Latifah McBryde faced barriers to competing at the collegiate level because their faith requires them to wear full-body uniforms, which were not permitted. Through their perseverance and the support of their coaches at Life University, they prompted the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and USA Wrestling to approve the modified uniforms. Their journey has opened doors for other athletes who require religious accommodations in the sport.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the 1985 Live Aid concert is being remembered as both a watershed moment for global charity and a flawed event subject to modern criticism. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia, the concert united billions of viewers and set a template for future benefit events. However, retrospective analyses highlight its significant lack of diversity, featuring almost no African or female performers, which critics argue reinforced a patronizing "white savior" narrative of Africa. Despite these flaws, the event raised millions and had tangible political ripple effects.</p>
