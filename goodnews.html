          <h2>Gap Shares Tumble Following Tariff Concerns Despite Earnings Beat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 16:20:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gap's stock price experienced a significant drop of over 15% after the company announced that potential tariffs could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. While Gap reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, the tariff concerns overshadowed the positive financial results. The company plans to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and reducing its reliance on China, aiming to lessen the financial impact. Despite these challenges, Gap's CEO remains optimistic, believing strong brands can succeed in any market, and the company does not anticipate raising prices for consumers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a decline of approximately 3% despite the company exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, which was attributed to tailwinds from artificial intelligence. The company's results come shortly after the announcement of its intent to acquire Informatica for $8 billion, a move aimed at strengthening its AI offerings. Analysts attribute the stock's reaction to a slight miss in current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a minor operating margin miss. Despite this, analysts maintain a positive outlook on Salesforce's demand environment and product cycle.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares rose in extended trading following an announcement that the company was raising its full-year earnings forecast and issuing a stronger-than-expected forecast for the current quarter. The company's adjusted earnings per share fell short of estimates, but revenue was in line with expectations. The optimistic outlook is attributed to a projected $7 billion in shipments of artificial intelligence systems during the quarter, which have higher profit margins than other Dell products. Dell expects overall revenue to grow 8% during the fiscal year, driven by strong demand for AI systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Predicting gold price changes is challenging, but several June dates could influence the market. The upcoming unemployment report on June 6 and the inflation report on June 11 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics may impact investor sentiment and, consequently, gold prices. The Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, where a potential rate cut could be discussed, also bears watching, as gold prices and interest rates often have an inverse relationship. Savvy investors may want to monitor these dates for potential buying or selling opportunities, though gold's response can be unpredictable. (not investment advice)</p>

Manfred emphasized that the list is effectively a ban on working in the game and that Rose, who died in September 2024, should be considered by the Hall of Fame like other players, including "Shoeless" Joe Jackson. He also noted that Rose entered a settlement agreement with the league, which allowed the Hall of Fame to consider him, and that Commissioner Giamatti stated the settlement should not affect the Hall of Fame's decision.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have declined again, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money. However, potential borrowers should consider the volatility of variable rates and calculate long-term affordability closely. Homeowners should be prepared for rates to potentially rise or fall unexpectedly and could refinance into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. Understanding these factors can help homeowners make informed decisions about using their home equity effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
