          <h2>New Federal Student Loan Repayment Plan Introduced Under Recent Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 16:59:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently passed bill has established a new student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), set to be available by July 2026. This income-driven plan will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum payment. Unlike some existing plans, it does not shield a portion of income from calculations and extends the loan forgiveness timeline to 30 years. As other repayment options are phased out, RAP may become the primary choice for new borrowers, offering some benefits like subsidies for those not reducing principal. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, U.S.-based AI startups secured a remarkable $104.3 billion in venture funding, nearly matching the total for all of 2024, with giants like OpenAI and Anthropic leading the charge. Despite this influx of capital, the market for exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized from 281 deals. The trend shows a pattern of frequent, but lower-value, "bolt-on" acquisitions by larger companies rather than high-value public offerings. Analysts suggest this dynamic reflects current macroeconomic conditions, though the investor appetite for AI applications remains strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>General Motors Reports $1.1 Billion Second-Quarter Impact from Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 16:23:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors announced that new auto tariffs negatively impacted its second-quarter results by $1.1 billion, though the company's overall earnings still surpassed Wall Street estimates. CFO Paul Jacobson confirmed the figure aligns with previous expectations, as the company anticipates a full-year tariff impact of $4 to $5 billion. GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives, and has not announced specific price increases related to the tariffs. The automaker affirmed its full-year guidance but noted the second half of the year will be more exposed to the new trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta flight bound for Atlanta was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff at Mexico City's airport when an Aeromexico jet landed on the same runway directly in its path. The Delta pilots applied the brakes as the plane reached approximately 71 miles per hour, successfully preventing a collision. The flight, carrying 150 people, returned to the gate and later departed safely for its destination. Delta has filed reports with aviation authorities in both the U.S. and Mexico, who are now investigating the serious air traffic control incident.</p>

According to the White House, the agreements will see the Philippines and Indonesia become "Open Market" partners, with Indonesia set to eliminate tariffs on 99% of its trade with the U.S. This allows American industrial, tech, and agricultural products to be sold there tariff-free. The deals were announced following a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and come ahead of an August 1st deadline for countries to reach trade agreements or face higher U.S. tariffs.
