          <p>In a recent interview, supermodel Christie Brinkley candidly discussed her four divorces, attributing the failures to various issues including a partner's drinking, infidelity, and financial motives. She expressed regret over not being able to save some of her marriages while also acknowledging that she felt unloved in those relationships. Despite the heartbreaks and the challenges of her past, Brinkley affirmed that she remains a "fool for love" and is open to finding a new partner, emphasizing that she has a great deal of happiness she would like to share.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 04:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, marking a breakthrough for the industry. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the largest offshore photovoltaic initiative of its kind for the company. The station, which covers about 60,000 square meters, is designed to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. Its proximity to the water's surface also enhances its energy generation efficiency.</p>

          <p>In a grueling match played in extreme heat and humidity, Japan's rugby team defeated Wales 24-19, extending Wales' international losing streak to 18 games. The Welsh team led at halftime but struggled to cope with the intense conditions in the second half, allowing Japan to mount a successful comeback. The game featured multiple water breaks and an extended halftime to ensure player safety. A late try by Halatoa Vailea secured the win for Japan, dropping Wales to a historic low of 14th in world rankings.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a difficult path in the Euro 2025 tournament, having been drawn into what experts are calling the "toughest group" alongside France and the Netherlands. This places three top-11 ranked teams in the same group, creating a highly competitive initial stage. While England enters as the defending champion and the Netherlands won in 2017, France is on an impressive eight-game winning streak. Wales, making its major tournament debut, is considered the underdog but has shown resilience in recent matches against top-tier opponents, making the group's outcome highly unpredictable.</p>

          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, an event that this article portrays as a bizarre yet honest reflection of American culture. The piece delves into Chestnut's intense training regimen, which includes neck exercises and breathing techniques, framing his dedication as akin to that of any other elite athlete. While acknowledging the spectacle's often grotesque nature, the author argues that the contest is a raw expression of consumption and competition. The event is presented as a satirical mirror to a society obsessed with excess, making Chestnut's performance a compelling cultural statement.</p>

          <h2>Cultural Background May Influence Perception of Visual Illusions, Studies Suggest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 03:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent scientific studies are reigniting the debate over whether culture shapes visual perception, yielding conflicting results. One study found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments tend to see rectangles in the Coffer illusion, while rural Namibians see circles, supporting a long-held hypothesis. However, another study challenges this idea by showing that the Müller-Lyer illusion affects non-human animals and even people blind from birth, suggesting it is not culturally learned. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of perception, which is an active construction by the brain rather than a direct window to reality, underscoring the diversity in how individuals experience the world.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a move celebrated as a key legacy of the 2024 Olympics. The city has established three supervised swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, near landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral. This was made possible by a €1.4 billion investment to improve water quality, which had been dangerously polluted since the ban was enacted in 1923. Authorities will continuously monitor the water for safety, marking a significant step in the city's efforts to enhance urban life and adapt to climate change.</p>

          <p>Scotland secured a hard-fought 29-26 victory against the Maori All Blacks in their tour-opening rugby match in New Zealand. Both teams scored four tries in a fast-paced game, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately made the difference for the Scots. Despite being outgained in possession and territory, Scotland's clinical attack and a massive defensive stand in the final moments allowed them to clinch the win. The victory was a significant achievement for a predominantly second-string Scottish side, which successfully withstood a late surge from the hosts to start their tour on a positive note.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal *Science*, found that a mouse's inability to regenerate is linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in cell development. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the team achieved complete restoration of lost cartilage and tissue. While applying these findings to humans remains a distant goal, the discovery provides hope and a new direction for research into organ regeneration for other parts of the body.</p>

While the injury is projected to sideline him for about six weeks, the team received positive news that there was no ligament damage, meaning he should return well before the playoffs. General Manager Brandon Gomes stated the team will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office is comfortable waiting for Muncy's return rather than making a reactive trade for a replacement, given their current strong position in the division.</p>
