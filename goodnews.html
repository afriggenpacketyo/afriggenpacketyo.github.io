          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has advanced to the Wimbledon finals after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka. This marks a significant comeback for the 23-year-old, who took a break from the sport in 2023 to address burnout and mental health struggles. During her time away, she focused on personal well-being through activities like painting and music. Her return to top-tier competition and subsequent success is a powerful story of resilience and prioritizing mental health in professional sports.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, a significant event coinciding with Nvidia becoming the first company to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly those intended for the Chinese market, which have impacted its sales. President Trump has praised Nvidia's stock performance, linking it to his administration's tariff policies, highlighting the intersection of big tech, global trade, and national economic strategy.

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly results, causing its stock to rise. The denim maker announced it plans to absorb some of the increased costs from President Trump's international tariffs for the time being, though this strategy depends on future trade policy developments. The company's positive performance is attributed to strong demand, reduced promotions, and premium pricing on new products, which helps offset the financial impact of the new duties. This situation illustrates how major brands are navigating the complex and evolving global trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
