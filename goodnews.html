          <p>NASA has introduced its newest class of 10 astronaut candidates, notable for being the agency's first to include more women than men. Selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants, the diverse group includes pilots, engineers, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director who will now undergo two years of rigorous training. These new astronauts are preparing for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars, joining the agency amidst challenges related to budget uncertainties and the ambitious Artemis program.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves just days after being suspended indefinitely. The late-night show was pulled following comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew sharp criticism and pressure from the FCC chairman. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense national situation but decided to reinstate the show after discussions with Kimmel, marking a significant moment in the ongoing debate over free speech and media accountability.</p>

          <p>India is investing $18.2 billion into its "Semiconductor Mission," an ambitious plan to build a complete domestic chip supply chain, from design to manufacturing and packaging. This strategic push aims to reduce reliance on imports and capture a larger share of the global electronics market, which is shifting away from China. The government has approved ten major projects, including fabrication plants by Tata Electronics and other firms. However, experts caution that India faces steep competition and must overcome significant infrastructural and policy hurdles to succeed in the highly complex semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is calling for the UK to offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research has been affected by Trump administration budget cuts. In a speech, Davey will propose a fellowship scheme to attract these researchers, positioning the UK as a leader in the global fight against cancer. He argued that if the U.S. government steps back from supporting vital biomedical research, the UK should step in to fill the void. This initiative is part of a broader critique by Davey against what he terms the U.S. government's "anti-science agenda."</p>

          <p>A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 4.3 struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley. The quake was widely felt across the region, waking many residents and causing shaking strong enough to knock items off shelves, but no major damage or injuries have been reported. The event prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. The incident serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the earthquake-prone region and the importance of preparedness for residents.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Comedic Satire of Trump is a Patriotic Duty</h2>

          <p>This commentary piece reflects on the temporary suspension and return of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, framing his role as a satirist of the powerful as a form of patriotic duty. The author argues that authoritarian regimes historically target humor because it builds camaraderie and dispels fear, making comedians who challenge power essential for a healthy democracy. The article contrasts genuine patriotism with what it describes as the narrow, Christian nationalist version promoted by some administration figures. It concludes by urging Kimmel not to temper his comedy, as self-censorship out of fear is a victory for authoritarianism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to take further action, such as ordering more tests or seeking a second opinion, to prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses. The goal is to make this "three strikes and rethink" approach standard practice across the country.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, which will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a cornerstone of Beijing's governance and is considered crucial for achieving its goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions at the upcoming fourth plenary session, the plan is expected to address rising uncertainties, including domestic economic challenges and a turbulent global landscape. Experts suggest the new plan may prioritize qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to allow for greater flexibility.</p>

          <p>A potential school shooting at a Northern California high school was thwarted after an anonymous tip was submitted through the "Say Something" reporting system. The tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, alerted police in Menlo-Atherton to concerning online posts by a former student. Law enforcement quickly located the student and recovered weapons from their home, preventing a planned attack. This marks the 19th credible school attack the system has helped prevent since its 2018 launch, highlighting the critical role that community vigilance and anonymous reporting can play in ensuring school safety.</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders appeared to confirm reports that his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, indicated he did not want to be drafted by the Baltimore Ravens or Philadelphia Eagles. During a podcast interview, the elder Sanders explained that Shedeur was hesitant to join a team with an established young star quarterback like Lamar Jackson or Jalen Hurts, questioning the logic of sitting on the bench for years. Shedeur, once considered a potential first-round pick, was ultimately selected in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns.
