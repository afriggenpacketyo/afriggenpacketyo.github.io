          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower prices on several prescription medications for Medicaid beneficiaries. This development is a key component of the White House's strategy to link U.S. drug costs to cheaper international rates, a policy President Trump advanced via executive order. Concurrently, the administration plans to introduce "TrumpRX," a new direct-to-consumer website designed to facilitate the purchase of prescription drugs at reduced prices for American citizens. This initiative aims to tackle high healthcare costs, with officials highlighting the president's commitment to leveraging federal power for significant savings. The long-term impact on drug affordability and market dynamics remains to be seen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canadian authorities have successfully identified human remains discovered in a Saskatoon well in 2006 as Alice Spence, a woman born in 1881 who had immigrated from Minnesota in 1913. Known as "The Woman in the Well," this nearly two-decade-old cold case was cracked through advanced investigative genetic genealogy, matching her DNA to descendants. Her remains, found partially dismembered in a barrel with period clothing, indicated suspicious circumstances. Investigators now believe her death occurred between 1916 and 1918, around the time her family's home was destroyed by fire. This breakthrough represents the oldest Canadian investigation resolved with genetic genealogy, underscoring the enduring power of forensic science and persistent police work in bringing closure to historical mysteries.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is actively pursuing a vision to become the world's first fully AI-powered megabank, fundamentally rewiring its operations for the artificial intelligence era. The bank's proprietary "LLM Suite" integrates leading AI models, continually fed with vast internal data, to empower employees with AI agents, automate back-end processes, and curate client experiences. Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron demonstrated the platform's ability to generate an investment banking presentation in seconds, a task previously requiring hours. While the full realization of this potential will take years and significant investment, the bank anticipates enhanced productivity, reduced costs, and a substantial first-mover advantage in the global finance market. This strategic shift could redefine corporate labor within the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have announced a groundbreaking achievement, successfully creating human eggs from adult skin cells in a laboratory, a development poised to transform fertility science. Led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the team employed a technique similar to that used for cloning Dolly the sheep, replacing donor egg DNA with that from skin cells. They then induced an unconventional cell division process, producing 82 functional eggs that could be fertilized to form embryos. However, these embryos currently possess genetic abnormalities, preventing healthy development. This technology, known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG), offers hope for infertile women and same-sex couples, yet it simultaneously ignites significant ethical debates regarding genetic manipulation and consent, requiring careful oversight as research progresses.</p>

          <p>The enduring appeal and wisdom of older persons are celebrated in the entertainment industry, as veteran actors continue to demonstrate significant star power in film and television. Recent successes like the Netflix film "The Thursday Murder Club," featuring octogenarians Dame Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, and the hit series "Only Murders in the Building," led by Steve Martin, 80, and Martin Short, exemplify this trend. These acclaimed performers, alongside figures such as Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, not only command screens but also openly share their perspectives on aging, proving that talent, charisma, and a "life full" spirit are timeless. Their sustained prominence underscores the industry's capacity to value experience and diverse age representation.</p>

          <p>Timor-Leste is officially set to become the 11th member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in October, marking the culmination of a 14-year application process. This accession, confirmed by Malaysian Prime Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, is anticipated to bring significant benefits, including enhanced regional inclusion and economic integration for the young nation, independent since 2002. Despite recent domestic protests regarding government spending, Timor-Leste maintains its status as Southeast Asia's most democratic country. While some citizens express skepticism about the immediate tangible benefits of ASEAN membership, leaders view it as a crucial step for the country's economic and political sovereignty, fostering new trade, investment, and educational opportunities within the region.</p>

This leadership change, which saw Spotify shares dip around 4% immediately after the announcement, is described by Ek as a formalization of the company's existing operational structure. He emphasized that he has progressively delegated daily management and strategic direction to Söderström and Norström over the past few years, highlighting their readiness to guide Spotify's future. In his new capacity, Ek will concentrate on long-term strategy and supporting the senior team, marking a pivotal moment for the streaming platform.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans reliant on Social Security will continue to receive their monthly payments even if the U.S. government shuts down, as these benefits are categorized as mandatory spending. However, a lapse in congressional appropriations could disrupt other Social Security Administration (SSA) services, which depend on an approved working budget. While roughly 90% of SSA employees are designated as essential and will continue operations, some administrative functions, such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards, may be temporarily halted. Despite the assurance of uninterrupted payments, beneficiaries could face delays and inconveniences in accessing non-critical support services until the federal funding impasse is resolved.</p>

          <p>Milorad Dodik, after nearly three decades in power, has withdrawn from all official roles in Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, effectively ending a protracted standoff with the state judiciary. This capitulation follows a Bosnian federal court's sentence of one year in prison and a six-year political ban for defying decisions by the High Representative. Despite initial threats of a referendum and secession, Dodik's party, SNSD, ultimately conceded, paving the way for an early presidential election. His downfall is attributed to unchecked corruption and a fragmented party, with his hopes for unwavering support from Moscow, Budapest, or Belgrade for secession never materialized, marking a significant political shift in the Balkans.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK following an international fraud investigation that led to what is believed to be the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure. The Metropolitan Police recovered 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion ($6.7 billion), which Qian illegally acquired between 2014 and 2017 through a large-scale scam defrauding over 128,000 victims in China. Qian pleaded guilty to illegally possessing the cryptocurrency after a seven-year probe involving multiple jurisdictions. She had fled China using false documents and attempted to launder the stolen funds by purchasing property in the UK. The conviction sends a clear message that the UK is not a safe haven for criminals. (not investment advice)</p>
