        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached an agreement to reset their relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 30, 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Additionally, both sides aim to create a "balanced youth experience" scheme for young people to work, study, volunteer, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time. The UK and EU will also consider allowing UK passport holders to use e-gates at European airports, potentially easing travel for Britons. The agreement comes amidst shifting global dynamics and a desire for closer cooperation on security and defense policy. </p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are holding their first summit, signaling a potential reset in relations. Despite a majority of Britons now regretting the decision to leave the EU, reversing Brexit is unlikely. The summit focuses on smaller-scale issues such as fishing rights and youth mobility, while topics like the single market and freedom of movement are off the table. The renewed ties are driven by geopolitical factors like the war in Ukraine and a less reliable United States, leading both sides to recognize the need for cooperation. </p>
