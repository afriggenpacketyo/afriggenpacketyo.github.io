          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating he never buys rice because he receives it as gifts, a comment that angered locals struggling with rising rice prices. This resignation occurs as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government deals with low approval ratings ahead of elections and tariff negotiations with the U.S. The Kyodo News reported that former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto. The article highlights the impact of soaring rice prices, driven by poor weather and protectionist policies, on Japanese consumers and the government's attempts to stabilize the market.</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, aims to produce high-end chips but faces challenges from President Trump's tariffs. While Malaysia had hoped to benefit from U.S.-China trade tensions by attracting companies seeking to diversify their operations, new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are creating uncertainty. The tariffs, along with potential blanket levies on semiconductor imports, threaten Malaysia's ambitious plans to move beyond assembly and testing to chip design and cutting-edge manufacturing. Companies operating in Malaysia, including American giants like Intel and Oracle, are discussing strategies to cope with the changing trade landscape, as disruptions in the supply chain could lead to higher costs for American consumers.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumours from weeks to just hours, researchers say. The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH). A study published on Wednesday reveals the method has already been used in 50 operations at NUH and has had a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumour. The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, and consultant neurosurgeon Stuart Smith said it was possible to get a diagnosis while a patient was still in the operating theatre for their original procedure.</p>
