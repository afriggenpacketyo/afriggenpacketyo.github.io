          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made an emotional return to Old Trafford, playing for Fiorentina in a pre-season friendly. De Gea, who left the club in 2023 after 545 appearances, received a standing ovation from the crowd, providing a farewell he was not previously afforded. The match also highlighted United's current goalkeeping situation, with his replacement Andre Onana injured and backup Altay Bayindir saving a penalty to secure a shootout victory. The event underscored the ongoing debate among fans about the decision to replace the long-serving goalkeeper.</p>

          <p>The stock market saw significant gains this week, with the Nasdaq reaching a new record high, largely driven by Apple's strong performance. The tech giant's stock surged after it committed to an additional $100 billion in US investments, securing an exemption from new tariffs on semiconductor imports announced by President Trump. This development overshadowed broader tariff concerns, including a 25% increase on India's tariff rate. The week also saw mixed earnings reports from major companies like Eli Lilly, which faced a steep decline, and DuPont, which reported a strong quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers Matt Linde and Udi Kore secured a 99-year ground lease for the former St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating for decades. The $104 million project preserved original architectural elements while adding modern amenities and a new wing, with 62 units designated for affordable housing. The transformation has been well-received by the local community and the adjacent church, which owns the land, for revitalizing a historic but neglected property.</p>

          <p>Haley Amaya, a 27-year-old model and dancer from Los Angeles, is dedicated to preserving her Honduran heritage through art. Growing up as the daughter of a single immigrant mother, she found refuge and identity in dance, eventually founding the "Cinco Estrellas" ballet to offer free Honduran folkloric dance classes to children in her community. Despite a successful modeling career, Amaya considers herself a cultural ambassador, using her own funds and donations to keep the program running. She aims to provide younger generations with the same sense of connection and purpose that art gave her, helping them navigate their identity in a new country.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. A former federal judge known for his integrity, Webster was appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 by President Carter to restore its image after a period of scandal. Later, President Reagan tapped him to lead the CIA in 1987 to steady the agency following the Iran-Contra affair. Webster was widely credited with bringing stability and a commitment to the rule of law to both agencies during tumultuous periods in their histories.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, now suggests that many retirees can safely withdraw more. In his new book, he argues that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7% or even higher for current retirees. Bengen's research indicates that most retirees are overly conservative with their spending and could enjoy more of their accumulated wealth. He emphasizes that factors like diversification and annual rebalancing can significantly improve portfolio longevity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 3D-printed robot crab named "Wavy Dave," designed to study mating behaviors, met a premature end when it was attacked and dismembered by real fiddler crabs. Researchers from the University of Exeter were using the robot in a Portuguese nature park to observe how male crabs react to rivals waving their large claws to attract females. The experiment revealed that male crabs adjust their own signaling behavior in response to competition. The real crabs only confronted the robot after females appeared to recognize it as an impostor, leading one male to tear off the robot's claw.</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, is re-emphasizing the long-held scientific consensus that there is no mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the region means the number of disappearances is statistically normal on a percentage basis. This view is supported by institutions like Lloyd's of London and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). NOAA explains that most incidents can be attributed to natural causes, such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather and complex navigation, combined with human error, rather than any supernatural or paranormal phenomena.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents who are constantly on their phones are modeling behavior that can hinder their children's success and well-being. Speaking at a panel, Robbins shared her personal experience of realizing her own phone habits were mirrored by her kids, leading to a loss of connection. She advises parents to be conscious of their own screen time, suggesting they put their phones away after work and avoid bringing them to the dinner table. By modeling "phone-life balance" and showing curiosity about their kids' online activities, parents can foster better habits and stronger family relationships.</p>

          <p>According to a new Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is needed to be considered wealthy in 2025, though this figure varies by region. Residents in the West cited the highest threshold at $3 million, while those in the South had the lowest at $1.8 million, reflecting regional differences in cost of living. Despite the high monetary benchmark, many respondents define wealth more broadly, including happiness, health, and relationships. The survey also found that the net worth needed to feel "financially comfortable" is a more attainable $839,000 on average.</p>

          <p>In a sign of easing tensions, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border with South Korea. The move follows a similar action by the South, which had halted its own anti-Pyongyang broadcasts shortly after the new, more conciliatory government of President Lee Jae Myung took office. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which involved blasting K-pop and news from the South and unsettling noises from the North, had been a source of irritation for border residents. This de-escalation is a notable positive step in inter-Korean relations.</p>
