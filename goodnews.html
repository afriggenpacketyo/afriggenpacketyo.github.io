          <p>A recent Beijing parade, observed by Hong Kong and Macau, is analyzed as a profound declaration of China's national cohesion and institutional resilience, transcending mere spectacle. The article argues for understanding its deep significance for national destiny and its role in the evolving global order, rather than solely through a Western-centric lens. It highlights how such events foster emotional release and a powerful sense of unity among the Chinese people, enabling individuals to connect with a shared national purpose and overcome personal anxieties in a fragmented world. This grand display underscores a tangible representation of collective strength, reinforcing China's established rise and its commitment to a unified future for its territories, demonstrating a deep-seated national identity and shared historical consciousness through orderly and formidable ranks.</p>

The media industry eagerly anticipates Kimmel's pre-taped monologue, marking his first public address on the controversial matter and the surrounding backlash.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 21:00:34 EDT</div>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has dramatically shifted his position on the Russia-Ukraine war, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO, citing Russia's economic troubles. This unexpected announcement followed talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly, where Trump also suggested NATO nations should shoot down Russian planes violating their airspace. Zelenskyy expressed surprise but viewed Trump's new stance as a "positive signal" of continued U.S. support. The article highlights Trump's previous unpredictability on the conflict and his emphasis on European and NATO financial backing for Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed surprise, albeit positive, at President Trump's recent Truth Social post asserting Ukraine could reclaim all its territory from Russia, calling Russia a "paper tiger." This marks a significant shift from Trump's previous suggestions of territorial swaps, which Zelenskyy had consistently rejected as unfair. The article notes Zelenskyy's belief that their relationship has improved and that Trump now understands the injustice of territorial concessions. Despite Trump's earlier skepticism about a quick resolution, this new stance offers a glimmer of hope for Ukraine's full territorial integrity and future security guarantees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Secret Service successfully disrupted a sprawling telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, seizing 300 SIM servers and over 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. This sophisticated network posed a serious potential threat to New York City's telecom systems and the ongoing U.N. General Assembly, with the capacity to disable cell phone towers and block emergency communications. Early analysis indicates the network was used by organized crime gangs, drug cartels, human trafficking rings, and foreign governments.

          <p>Renowned pop star Lulu, 76, has candidly revealed her long-kept secret of being a recovering alcoholic in her new memoir, describing the admission as "liberating." The article details her journey to sobriety, which began after confiding in her family at age 65, leading her to rehab and a dedicated commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu attributes her addiction partly to a challenging childhood with an alcoholic father and the pressure to maintain a "squeaky clean" public image, which she felt led to a loss of her authentic self. She hopes sharing her story will offer hope to others and break generational patterns of addiction.</p>

It explains that while the federal CALM Act regulates broadcast, satellite, and cable TV, it currently excludes streaming services, allowing advertisers to exploit loopholes.
