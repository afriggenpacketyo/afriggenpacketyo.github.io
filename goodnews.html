          <p>Shares of Kering, the French fashion house owning Gucci and Saint Laurent, experienced a 7% surge following reports that Renault's CEO, Luca de Meo, is expected to become the group's new CEO. De Meo's potential appointment is viewed as a strategic move to revitalize Kering's brands, particularly Gucci, which has seen a decline in popularity. Analysts believe de Meo's brand management and marketing skills align well with the luxury industry's needs, citing his successful turnaround of Renault, however, some experts suggest that turning around luxury brands is complex, costly, and requires significant investment, and if such revenue and cash flow for the group is achieved, it could result in significant multiple re-rating. Kering's shares have fallen over 60% in the last two years due to profit warnings and designer changes at Gucci.</p>

          <p>Researchers have tracked a plumed egret flying non-stop for 38 hours between Australia and Papua New Guinea during its northern migration. The Australian scientists used GPS to follow eight plumed egrets and 10 great egrets after the birds left the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales. One plumed egret flew almost 2,400 kilometers over several months before settling near Kalo, taking 38 hours to cross 700km across the Coral Sea, marking the first time scientists have recorded the plumed egrets' migration. This discovery adds to the understanding of bird migration patterns and the impressive endurance capabilities of these species.</p>

A key focus will be a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding tariffs that threaten Japan's export-driven economy. Ishiba aims to maintain G7 unity in addressing global issues, including the situation in the Indo-Pacific and the war in Ukraine. The summit is expected to cover topics ranging from global growth uncertainty to supply chain resilience and the use of artificial intelligence, and it is unlikely to issue a joint declaration, instead releasing documents on specific points.</p>

The two leading Chinese chip firms have been put on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses before domestic firms can ship products to them. This move reinforces existing policies and tightens loopholes, potentially raising the punishment for future breaches. The decision reflects Taiwan's commitment to national security and cooperation with international efforts to restrict technology transfers to entities involved in arms proliferation.</p>

          <p>Japan is enhancing its cyber defense capabilities by shifting from a reactive to a preemptive posture, enacting new legislation to protect critical systems and sensitive industrial data. The government is urging private-sector cooperation to safeguard infrastructure run by private firms, which are frequent targets of cyberattacks. The legislation allows the government to track online communications data and take early action to shut down harmful servers, and the country plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027. These measures aim to counter cyber threats from China, North Korea, and Russia, as well as criminal groups.</p>

          <h2>China's Retail Sales Surge Amid Government Support, Industrial Output Slows</h2>

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, jumping 6.4% year-on-year, boosted by government subsidies and consumer goods trade-in programs. However, industrial output slowed to 5.8% year-on-year, slightly weaker than analysts' expectations, and fixed-asset investment expanded 3.7% year-to-date, undershooting forecasts. The improving consumption is a welcome respite for China's economy, which has been struggling with persistent deflation, but the country's industrial output slowed to 5.8% year on year in May from 6.1% in the prior month.</p>
