          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, signaling renewed confidence in the manufacturer's quality control. The FAA had revoked this privilege in 2019 for the MAX and 2022 for the Dreamliner following fatal crashes and production defects. Under the new plan, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks, allowing FAA inspectors to focus more on surveillance of the production process itself. The decision comes as Boeing works to stabilize its manufacturing and move past recent safety crises.</p>

          <p>HSBC has announced a successful trial using quantum computing to optimize bond trading, a development it calls a 'world-first' in the financial services industry. In collaboration with IBM, the bank utilized a hybrid approach combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor to achieve a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions. The trial focused on more accurately estimating the likelihood of a trade being filled at a quoted price in over-the-counter markets. This advancement suggests quantum technology is moving from a theoretical concept to a practical tool for increasing margins and liquidity.</p>

          <p>President Trump traveled to Bethpage Black in New York to attend the first day of the 45th Ryder Cup, the biennial golf competition between the United States and Europe. His visit was described by top American player Scottie Scheffler as a boost for the US team during a challenging time for the country. The president, an avid golfer and owner of numerous courses, has been actively involved in the sport, including hosting LIV Golf events and engaging in merger talks between LIV and the PGA Tour. The US team entered the tournament as favorites but faced an early deficit against the European squad.</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a significant procedural error. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was 'unlawful' because prosecutors failed to bring it within the required six-month time limit by just one day. Ó hAnnaidh was charged after allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a London concert, an act he and his supporters have described as a political statement about Gaza. Following the ruling, the rapper stated the case was an attempt to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has unveiled a series of massive infrastructure partnerships, signaling its ambition to become the next major hyperscaler in the technology industry. The company announced a deal with Nvidia for up to $100 billion to build data center capacity, and an expanded 'Stargate' project with Oracle and SoftBank valued at $400 billion. CEO Sam Altman stated that delivering the next era of AI will require trillions in spending, a strategy aimed at meeting insatiable market demand for its models. Despite the immense scale and execution risks, including vast energy requirements, the moves are seen as an existential push to lead the race for superintelligence.</p>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, remained unchanged at 2.9% on an annual basis in August. The overall PCE index, which includes food and energy, saw a slight increase to 2.7% year-over-year. These figures were in line with economists' forecasts and are unlikely to alter the central bank's course after it recently lowered its benchmark interest rate. The data suggests that despite ongoing price pressures, inflation is not accelerating unexpectedly, giving the Fed room to focus on the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill advancing in Congress, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, aims to change the language used by the Social Security Administration to describe retirement benefit options. The proposal would rename 'early eligibility age' (62) to 'minimum benefit age' and 'full retirement age' (67) to 'standard benefit age' to better communicate the financial trade-offs of claiming at different times. The goal is to reduce confusion and help Americans make more informed decisions about their retirement income. This legislative effort is separate from, but occurs alongside, broader debates about potentially raising the retirement age to address the program's long-term funding shortfall.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to lower the price of its new 'Gold Card' residency visa from $5 million to $1 million has reportedly triggered a surge in demand from wealthy individuals globally. Immigration attorneys describe the program as highly competitive in the global visa market, offering access to the US education, healthcare, and financial systems for a relatively low price. The program, which aims to raise significant federal revenue, still faces legal and logistical hurdles, as the application process is not yet active. The $1 million fee is structured as an 'unrestricted gift' to the government to bypass congressional immigration law.</p>

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle should secure a trademark as a foundational legal step. The expert compares a trademark for a business name or logo to a deed for a house, providing essential ownership rights and protection against potential lawsuits. Failing to do so can expose an entrepreneur to legal action from others with similar branding, even if the side business is only generating small amounts of revenue. The advice emphasizes thinking about the future growth of the business and establishing proper legal protections, like trademarks and copyrights, from the outset.</p>

The legislation proposes creating model zoning codes to encourage denser construction and offers financial incentives to municipalities that successfully increase their housing supply. While modest, analysts suggest the bill's framework resembles a 'Right-to-Build Zone' concept, where the federal government could empower cities to create special areas with streamlined regulations to spur development.
