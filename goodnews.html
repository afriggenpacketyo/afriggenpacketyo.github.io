          <h2>Psychologists Offer Advice for Managing Stress During Major Sporting Events</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 19:00:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England's women's football team advances to the Euro 2025 final, many fans report experiencing intense physical and emotional stress. Experts in psychology explain that these reactions are driven by hormonal surges, including adrenaline and cortisol, which are a natural response to high-stakes situations. To cope with the anxiety, specialists recommend getting adequate rest, planning match-day activities, and engaging in physical movement to manage the adrenaline. They also emphasize reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression, regardless of the final outcome.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a "possible landing gear incident" during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely deplaned from the Boeing 737 MAX 8, with only one person transported for a minor injury. The airline stated the aircraft experienced a maintenance issue with a tire and has been removed from service for inspection. The incident caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays at the airport, but operations have since returned to normal, and an FAA investigation is underway.</p>

          <p>Despite being a highly-touted prospect, Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is maintaining a patient and positive outlook while primarily taking snaps with the third-string team in training camp. Sanders, who surprisingly fell to the fifth round of the NFL Draft, stated that the situation is not in his control and does not diminish his confidence in his abilities. He emphasized his journey from an HBCU to a Power 5 conference and now to the NFL as proof of his resilience. The Browns' coaching staff has been giving starting reps to other quarterbacks while Deshaun Watson continues his rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Teenage darts sensation Luke Littler executed a stunning nine-darter to help secure his place in the World Matchplay final against James Wade. The 18-year-old world champion was trailing his opponent, Josh Rock, before achieving the perfect leg, a feat which he said "sparked him into life" and turned the match in his favor. This victory puts Littler in a position to win the prestigious Triple Crown, having already secured the Premier League and World Championship titles. The final will be a rematch of the UK Open final, where Littler previously defeated Wade.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:30:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing regulations to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties, and the process for businesses to get licenses for outdoor areas would be streamlined. The government hopes these measures will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry by making it easier to open new establishments and host events. The opposition, however, argues the policy is hypocritical given other tax policies they claim have harmed the sector.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank, California, executed a rapid dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision. The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when the pilots of Flight 1496 received an onboard traffic alert about another aircraft, a decommissioned fighter jet, in the vicinity. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the event. While no passengers reported injuries, one flight attendant was treated for minor injuries, and another was hospitalized after the plane landed safely and "uneventfully" in Las Vegas.</p>

However, during the visit, Muizzu described India as the Maldives' "closest and most trusted partner." Modi's trip included the announcement of a new credit line, inauguration of India-funded infrastructure projects, and discussions on a potential free-trade agreement, signaling a mending of diplomatic tensions.</p>
