        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two tickets, sold in Missouri and Texas, have won the massive $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, marking the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history after a three-month period without a big winner. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, and 62, with Powerball 17, and the ticketholders can choose between a lump sum of $410.3 million or $893.5 million paid over 30 years. This drawing was the 42nd since the last jackpot win on May 31, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings without a winner. The odds of winning were 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 24.9. The lottery is always a game of chance, and so the score of the drawing itself is ultimately random.</p>

          <p>Shaun Cassidy, former teen idol and son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, after focusing on a behind-the-scenes career as a television writer and producer. Cassidy has been relearning his own hits and brushing up on his guitar skills, taking guitar lessons and rediscovering songs he wrote. His 50-city "The Road to Us Tour" will kick off at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and will feature classic hits, new music, and personal stories from his career. Cassidy admits he never enjoyed being a public figure and prefers being behind the scenes, but he is embracing the challenge of returning to the stage. The tour will include his hit song "Da Doo Ron Ron," but he is glad to be able to sing songs he likes, and feels that he can sing better now because he hasn't burnt his voice out. </p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn to address the threat of oligarchic control in the U.S., drawing a crowd of 1,700 people. Mamdani condemned capitalistic greed and vowed to freeze rent prices, increase housing, and raise taxes for New York's richest 1%. Sanders praised Mamdani's campaign as a grassroots movement challenging billionaire donors and tech oligarchs allied with Trump. The article highlights the muted response from mainstream Democrats and Mamdani's plans to defend immigrant communities. The article also notes that Eric Adams reaffirmed his plan to remain in the mayoral race, despite reports that Trump has been allegedly encouraging him to drop out of the race in order to help Cuomo beat Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers for the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot are 11, 23, 44, 61, 62 with a Powerball of 17, and the jackpot has an estimated cash value of $826.4 million. It was not immediately known if there were any winners of Saturday's jackpot, which climbed after no winning tickets were sold for Wednesday night's $1.4 billion grand prize. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and drawings take place every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday at 11 p.m. ET. Powerball tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and cost $2 each. This is always a game of chance, and so the score of the drawing itself is ultimately random.</p>

          <h2>US-China Team Uses Bubble-Popping Energy to Launch Robots</h2>

          <p>A US-China team has developed a method to launch millimetre-scale jumpers using the energy from collapsing vapour bubbles. The process involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. The sudden collapse of these bubbles releases energy, creating a force that can launch the jumpers 1.5 metres into the air. By controlling the light flow, scientists can manipulate the launch direction and even make the materials swim. The researchers demonstrate that cavitation can serve as an efficient launching mechanism, and this could be used in the future to explore the world.</p>

          <p>Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka defeated Amanda Anisimova in straight sets to win her second consecutive US Open title. Sabalenka won 6-3, 7-6(3) in a match against home crowd favorite Amanda Anisimova, the No. 8 seed. Sabalenka had lost in both the Australian Open and French Open finals earlier this year. Sabalenka is the first woman to win back-to-back US Opens since Serena Williams claimed three consecutive titles from 2012 to 2014. The victory is a great achievement for Sabalenka, who has worked hard to get to where she is today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across the U.S. are implementing locked magnetic pouches, like Yondr, to enforce cellphone bans, complying with mandates in states like New York. The pouches, costing $25-30 per student, are locked and unlocked using magnets at school entrances and offices. Students have mixed reactions, with some welcoming the idea and others plotting to bypass the system. The pouches are intended to reduce distractions and promote engagement in the classroom, but the cost has sparked debates about school budget priorities. Despite some students finding ways around the restrictions, the goal is to create a culture change and improve the learning environment.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was gifted special baseball treats after an adult fan took his home run ball during a game against the Miami Marlins. After a man grabbed the ball and gave it to the boy, a woman berated him, claiming the ball was hers and took it back. The Marlins gave the boy a gift bag, and the Phillies arranged for him to meet the player who hit the home run, Harrison Bader, who gave him an autographed bat. The young Phillies fan also got to see his team win, defeating the Marlins 9-3. It is always great to see people be generous.</p>

          <p>A former soldier is advocating for greater recognition and support for women veterans who served in dangerous front-line roles. Dr. Bex Bennett, co-founder of Sisters in Service, aims to address the challenges faced by female military veterans, particularly in healthcare. The group provides support through meetings and activities, combating misconceptions about women's involvement in modern conflicts. Bennett emphasizes the need for understanding and connection among female veterans, who often avoid traditional spaces due to societal perceptions. This is an important cause, and it is good to see people working to support veterans.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born boy, is set to become the first millennial saint, known for creating websites documenting "miracles" to spread Catholic teaching. More than a million people have visited his body in Assisi, and his canonization was approved after two miracles were attributed to him. A shrine dedicated to him has been established at Our Lady of Dolours Church in London, where he was baptized. Acutis, who died of leukemia at 15, is being fast-tracked by the Vatican to inspire faith in young people. He will be remembered for his life and his faith.</p>
