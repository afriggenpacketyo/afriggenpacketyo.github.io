          <p>Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, an ether treasury company, surged over 19% following the disclosure that billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, had acquired a 9% stake. The investment, aimed at establishing Bitmine as a significant player in the ether space, also lifted the stock prices of other crypto-focused firms. This market enthusiasm is further fueled by recent positive developments, including Robinhood's expansion in Europe and renewed optimism for the passage of a key stablecoin bill in the U.S. Congress.

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, revealed a plan to President Donald Trump to build ten large AP1000 nuclear reactors in the U.S., with construction slated to begin by 2030. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value nationwide. This announcement aligns with President Trump's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The plan comes despite the company's previous project at Plant Vogtle facing significant budget overruns and delays, which led to its bankruptcy before a 2018 restructuring.</p>

          <p>A nurse, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she was suspended for complaining about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support allegations that included failures of patient care and misgendering her colleague. The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, where Ms. Peggie is suing the health board under the Equality Act, resumed. The case highlights ongoing debates in Scotland regarding transgender rights and the legal definition of sex, particularly following a recent UK Supreme Court ruling.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold another 225,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $37 million, as part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March. This brings his total sales this year to about 1.2 million shares, worth around $190 million. The sale occurs as Nvidia's market capitalization has soared past $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company. The company also announced it plans to restart sales of its H20 chips to China after the Trump administration indicated it would approve the necessary export licenses.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This flat reading, which was also seen in the core PPI, suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had only a marginal impact on prices so far. However, the report contained conflicting signals, as final demand goods prices rose 0.3%, offset by a drop in services costs. While the annual PPI rate slowed, the data provides a complex picture for the Federal Reserve as it weighs future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican senators have decided to protect the U.S.-backed global HIV/Aids program, Pepfar, from proposed government spending cuts. An initial plan to cut $400 million from the program has been reversed, following bipartisan concern over the impact on a program credited with saving tens of millions of lives. The move came as part of a larger rescissions bill aimed at clawing back previously approved funding, including for international aid and public broadcasting. The White House has reportedly agreed to the amendment, which is part of a broader effort to reduce government spending under President Trump.</p>

          <p>Professional cycling teams at the 2025 Tour de France are increasingly incorporating heat training into their preparation, not just to acclimate to warm weather but to boost overall performance. Sports scientists explain that raising an athlete's core body temperature to a mild, fever-like state can increase blood volume and improve oxygen delivery to muscles. This can be achieved actively, by wearing heavy clothing during training, or passively through saunas. Some experts suggest that heat training can be more effective and accessible than traditional altitude training for enhancing athletic endurance.</p>
