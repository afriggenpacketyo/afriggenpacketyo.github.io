        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the deployment of French nuclear weapons elsewhere in Europe, emphasizing that this would not compromise France's own defense capabilities. Macron noted the existing presence of U.S. nuclear-armed aircraft in Europe and stated France's readiness to engage in discussions. He clarified that any expansion would be conditional, with France maintaining ultimate control over the weapons and its defense remaining intact. Several European leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, have shown interest in exploring such a possibility, driven by concerns over the U.S.'s nuclear commitment to Europe amidst Russian threats.</p>

          <p>Aides to former U.S. President Joe Biden have refuted claims in a new book alleging a cover-up of his 'physical deterioration' during his re-election campaign. The book, 'Original Sin', suggests Biden's condition was so poor that aides discussed using a wheelchair. A spokesperson for Biden defended his effectiveness as president, stating that 'evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.' The book cites anonymous sources and claims that aides sought to accommodate Biden's declining physical condition by shortening walking distances and ensuring the use of handrails.</p>

          <p>China has completed key technology checks for an experimental bullet-shaped satellite in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), a step towards building a 300-satellite constellation for high-resolution remote sensing and communications. The Chutian-001 satellite demonstrated core capabilities such as precise satellite control, real-time target detection, and space environment monitoring. VLEO satellites offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission but face challenges due to atmospheric drag, requiring regular thruster firings. The Chutian constellation project is part of China's broader effort to expand its commercial space sector.</p>
