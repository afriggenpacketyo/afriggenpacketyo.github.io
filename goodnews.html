          <p>Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai is partnering with Singapore's largest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, to introduce a robotaxi service in the coming months. The initial deployment will feature autonomous vehicles operating on fixed routes within Singapore's Punggol residential district. This expansion marks Pony.ai's third overseas venture, following recent partnerships in Qatar and testing in Dubai. The company also has plans to launch a similar service in Hong Kong, signaling its growing ambitions in international markets.</p>

          <p>At a major arms exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan has highlighted its strategy of enhancing defense self-reliance while deepening cooperation with the United States. The event featured the debut of the island's first domestically built anti-ballistic missile system, the Chiang-Kong, designed to intercept missiles at high altitudes. Alongside this, a cruise missile co-developed with an American defense firm was also displayed. This dual approach underscores Taiwan's efforts to build a credible deterrent amid increasing military pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the Republican Party will hold a national convention for the 2026 midterm elections, an unusual move as such events are typically reserved for presidential election years. In a social media post, Trump stated the convention would be "at the highest level" and described it as both "fun, and very productive." The decision comes as the party aims to secure and expand its narrow majorities in Congress. The move reflects a potential new strategy in national party politics, as some Democrats have also reportedly considered a similar idea.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and worked in the country for decades, were freed following mediation efforts by Qatar and emotionally reunited with their daughter in Doha. The family expressed immense relief and gratitude, noting the couple's health had deteriorated significantly during their detention under harsh conditions. The Taliban stated the pair were released after judicial proceedings for breaking Afghan laws but never specified the charges.</p>

          <p>Comedic actress Lilly Singh describes her perfect Sunday in Los Angeles as a "self-love, reset day" filled with intentional routines and personal time. Her day begins with journaling and stretching, followed by a visit to the Studio City Farmers Market for specific items like kefir yogurt and fresh flowers to decorate her home. A key part of her ritual is a solo brunch at Sweet Butter Kitchen, which she treats as a date with herself. Singh also uses the day for monthly goal reflections, social planning, and often enjoys a movie by herself at Universal CityWalk.</p>

          <h2>International High Seas Treaty to Become Law After Reaching Ratification Threshold</h2>

          <p>A landmark global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters, known as the High Seas Treaty, is set to become law after Morocco became the 60th nation to ratify it. The treaty, which will take effect in January, will allow for the creation of marine protected areas in the high seas—waters beyond national jurisdiction that cover over two-thirds of the ocean. This milestone, achieved in what experts call "record time," is being hailed by environmental groups as a "monumental achievement" for conservation. It enables the "30 by 30" goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and a colleague were convicted in New York for fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering, having shipped hundreds of kilos of the materials into the United States disguised as everyday goods. This case was part of the first U.S. prosecution targeting Chinese companies for directly trafficking these chemicals into the U.S., rather than to cartels in Mexico, marking a significant step in combating the fentanyl crisis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. According to Trump, the agreement would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing it to continue operating under "very tight control." However, confirmation from Beijing was less clear, with state media quoting Xi as saying China "welcomes negotiations." A key sticking point remains the ownership of the app's powerful algorithm, and ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has only stated it will work to ensure the app remains available to American users.</p>

          <p>Facing slowing demand from traditional markets in Europe and the U.S., many Chinese companies are now using a trade fair in Nanning as a gateway to expand into Southeast Asia. Exporters are increasingly attracted to the region's fast-growing economies and large, young consumer base. For example, an electric scooter manufacturer that has long relied on Western sales now sees Southeast Asia as a key area for future growth, citing market saturation in the West. The annual event has become a crucial testing ground for Chinese firms looking to pivot their export strategies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has thrown out President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, though he has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint. The judge ruled that the initial 85-page filing was improperly filled with political rhetoric and personal attacks, calling it a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a valid legal document. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to undermine his presidential campaign. The judge did not rule on the merits of the case but on the improper format of the complaint.</p>

          <p>Michael Eisner, who served as CEO of Disney for over two decades, has publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel following his indefinite suspension by the Disney-owned ABC network. In a social media post, Eisner condemned the move as "out-of-control intimidation," linking it directly to threats made by the FCC Chairman. Questioning where corporate leadership has gone, he argued that executives should stand up against bullies to protect the First Amendment. Eisner's statement adds a significant voice of dissent from a former industry leader against the network's decision to pull the late-night host.</p>
