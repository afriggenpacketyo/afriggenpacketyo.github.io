          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking to diversify away from U.S. markets amid trade policy uncertainties. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of Japanese assets, the largest monthly inflow since 1996. While confidence in U.S. assets is being restored with softening trade stances, the surge highlights Japan's appeal as a safe-haven destination. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current monetary policy stance, anticipating a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law permitting preemptive cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. The "active cyberdefense" law requires key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations. An independent panel will oversee data acquisition and actions to neutralize hostile servers, ensuring government surveillance is conducted properly and personal rights are upheld.</p>
