          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a massive cryptocurrency scam, leading to the world's single largest bitcoin seizure valued over £5 billion ($6.7 billion). Qian defrauded over 128,000 victims in China between 2014 and 2017, subsequently fleeing to the UK using false documents to launder the stolen funds by purchasing property. Her guilty plea concludes a seven-year international investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, with the Crown Prosecution Service now working to recover the assets for victims. This article highlights the increasing use of cryptocurrencies by organized crime and the complexities of global money laundering, marking a significant victory for law enforcement.</p>

The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center, with human interaction minimized to foster natural hunting behaviors and habitat familiarity, ensuring they would not form human attachments. This successful release is crucial for the "near-threatened" mountain lion population in California, which faces declining numbers due to various threats like vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment.

          <p>Darren Waller delivered a standout performance, catching two touchdown passes, to help the Miami Dolphins secure their first win of the 2025 season against the New York Jets. Waller, playing his first game for the Dolphins after a year off, showcased his vintage form, scoring his first touchdowns since October 2023. The victory was marred by a gruesome knee injury to star receiver Tyreek Hill, which multiple reports indicated could be a dislocated knee, potentially sidelining him for the remainder of the season. Despite the Jets' significant penalty struggles and three turnovers, the Dolphins' offense, led by Tua Tagovailoa, capitalized on key opportunities to secure the win.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong could serve as China's crucial gateway to the United Nations, bolstering Beijing's vision of global governance and promoting inclusive reforms within the UN. Given its official English language status, robust common law tradition, and extremely low corporate taxes, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to host a major UN secretariat hub in Asia. The article suggests that by leveraging Hong Kong, China, already the UN's second-largest donor, can deepen its international engagement and bring the world closer to China. This perspective highlights Hong Kong's potential role in global diplomacy and leadership.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA). The judge, Royce Lamberth, cited "concerning disrespect" from the administration regarding previous orders to restore VOA programming, which President Trump had tried to shut down as "radical propaganda." This ruling preserves the agency's operations while the underlying motion to block job cuts is litigated. The article underscores the ongoing legal battle to protect VOA's mission of projecting American values and providing fact-based news globally, especially in an "information war."</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer believes a looming government shutdown won't significantly impact the stock market, citing historical trends where stocks performed well during past shutdowns. His main concern is the delay in releasing vital economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. While acknowledging the potential for hundreds of thousands of federal workers to be furloughed and a negative impact on GDP growth, Cramer differentiates a shutdown from a debt ceiling default. The article provides a financial analyst's perspective on the economic implications, suggesting that delayed data collection is the primary, albeit manageable, concern. (not investment advice)</p>
