          <p>Jamie Borthwick, known for his role in EastEnders, has been suspended by the BBC after using a derogatory term for people with disabilities during the filming of 'Strictly Come Dancing.' The incident occurred backstage at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom, where Borthwick reportedly used the slur to describe the people of the seaside town. Borthwick issued a statement apologizing for his language, stating that he did not fully understand the term's meaning and is now deeply embarrassed by his actions. Disability charity Scope has urged Borthwick to educate himself on the realities of disabled people's lives. The BBC has deemed his language 'entirely unacceptable' and not reflective of their values.</p>

Jarmond anticipates a larger share of revenue going to football and men‚Äôs basketball players.

Both eaglets, born in March, are nearly 13 weeks old. Young eagles typically return to the nest soon after their first flight and will remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own.</p>

While this series provided a positive start, tougher tests lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled on the big stage. The key question is whether the "new" England can perform under pressure when it matters most. The dominant manner in which they have been winning gives reason for optimism.</p>
