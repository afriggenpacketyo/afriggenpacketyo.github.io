          <p>In The Hundred cricket tournament, Southern Brave secured a decisive nine-wicket victory over Birmingham Phoenix, largely due to a strong bowling performance. England's Jofra Archer claimed two wickets for 16 runs, while New Zealand's Michael Bracewell took three for 10, restricting Phoenix to a low score of 106-7. Southern Brave's batsmen, Leus du Plooy and James Vince, chased the target comfortably, reaching it with 19 balls remaining and placing their team at the top of the league table.</p>

          <p>Former baseball star David Justice recently discussed his 1990s marriage and subsequent divorce from actress Halle Berry, attributing their split to his own immaturity and traditional expectations at the time. Justice explained that his perspective on a wife's role was based on his Midwest upbringing, which clashed with Berry's burgeoning Hollywood career. He admitted that they never had issues with infidelity and believes their marriage might have survived with therapy, providing a retrospective look at their high-profile relationship.</p>

However, critics like former SEC official Amanda Fischer warn that the crypto market is highly speculative and volatile, comparing the current fervor to the high-risk financial products that led to the 2008 crisis.

The film chronicled how Lovell and his crew survived an in-flight explosion, safely returning to Earth after looping around the moon, a story of resilience and ingenuity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, individuals with high blood pressure should avoid taking licorice root supplements, as well as consuming licorice in other forms like tea or candy. The compound glycyrrhizin, found in licorice, can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance strains the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including headaches, fluid retention, and even an abnormal heart rhythm. Doctors advise consulting a physician before starting any new supplement.</p>
