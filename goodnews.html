          <p>The Royal Australian Air Force plane carrying Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made an emergency landing in St. Louis, Missouri, on Tuesday night while returning from Washington, D.C. The diversion was prompted by a medical incident in which a crew member was reportedly struck by falling luggage and suffered a concussion. The aircraft landed safely at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, and the injured crew member was transported to a hospital for treatment. The Prime Minister had just concluded a visit to the White House where he and President Trump signed a critical minerals deal.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Luca Guadagnino's new film, "After the Hunt," uses a sexual assault allegation within a university's philosophy department as a backdrop to explore themes of performance and optics rather than cancel culture itself. Starring Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield, the movie follows academics whose obsession with being perceived as morally correct poisons their relationships and obscures the truth. The film's controversial ending, where the director's voice calls "Cut!", breaks the fourth wall, suggesting the on-screen drama is a deliberate construction. This choice reinforces the idea that the characters are more concerned with their public image than with substance or justice.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is forecast to bring significant rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for potential flash flooding and landslides, with rainfall totals expected to reach 5 to 10 inches in some areas through Saturday. As of Wednesday morning, the storm was moving west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and could strengthen into a hurricane by Thursday. While its long-term path remains uncertain, current models suggest it is unlikely to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>Météo France has named Storm Benjamin, which is expected to bring wet and windy conditions to the United Kingdom on Thursday, with the most severe impacts anticipated in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The UK Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for rain and wind across southern and eastern England, as well as parts of Wales. Forecasters predict widespread rainfall of 20-30mm and wind gusts of 45-55 mph, with potential for localized flooding and travel disruption. While the impacts in the UK are not expected to be severe enough to warrant naming by the Met Office, the system is associated with the same storm affecting the continent.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to a one-month low has spurred a significant increase in homeowner refinancing activity. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance rose 4% for the week and were 81% higher than the same period last year, as borrowers seek to lower their monthly payments. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.37%. However, the decline in rates did not motivate potential homebuyers, as applications for purchase mortgages fell by 5% for the week, suggesting buyers may be waiting for even lower rates or are deterred by high home prices.

          <p>Robert Herjavec, a Canadian businessman and star of "Shark Tank," is humorously recalling the day he was mistaken for baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani. Two years ago, during Ohtani's free agency, a private jet flying from California to Toronto sparked widespread speculation that Ohtani was signing with the Blue Jays, only for Herjavec to emerge from the plane. With the Blue Jays now facing Ohtani's Dodgers in the World Series, the story has resurfaced. Herjavec, a Blue Jays fan, jokes that the incident is his "crowning achievement" of letting down an entire nation and hopes his support will redeem him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contributor argues that the current cultural obsession with adding protein to everything from coffee to snacks is largely a marketing-driven trend, as most Americans already consume more than enough protein. The piece contends that this fixation mirrors past food fads like "fat-free" and "sugar-free," which often led to unhealthy, ultra-processed products. The author, a researcher at Columbia University, emphasizes that protein needs vary significantly by age and activity level, and a blanket call for more protein ignores basic biology. The article advocates for a balanced, whole-food diet over reliance on fortified products that can add unnecessary calories.</p>

          <p>As the MLS playoffs begin, the field is considered wide open, with only seven points separating the top six teams in the regular season standings. San Diego FC's remarkable inaugural season, which saw them lead the Western Conference, was a major storyline. Analysts are watching key players like LAFC's Son Heung-min and considering dark horse contenders such as the Columbus Crew and Minnesota United. Many experts are predicting a blockbuster MLS Cup final between LAFC and Inter Miami, which would feature a high-profile matchup between Son and Lionel Messi in what could be a farewell match for Miami's Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba.</p>

          <p>Eurostar has announced a €2 billion deal to purchase up to 50 new double-decker "Celestia" trains, marking the first time such trains will operate through the Channel Tunnel. The company aims to increase its annual passenger capacity to 30 million and says the new trains will offer more seats, potentially leading to lower fares. The first of these high-capacity trains are expected to enter service in 2031, expanding the fleet that serves routes between London and continental European cities. While the high-speed line to London can accommodate the taller trains, their widespread use across the UK is unlikely due to older infrastructure constraints.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays raised its full-year guidance and announced a surprise £500 million ($670 million) share buyback alongside its third-quarter earnings report. The bank now expects its return on tangible equity to be greater than 11% for the year, an upgrade from its previous forecast. Despite a 7% year-over-year decline in pre-tax profit to £2.1 billion, which was slightly below expectations, the positive outlook and buyback announcement pushed the company's shares higher. The results were impacted by a £235 million charge related to the UK's car loan scandal, but the investment banking division showed an 8% increase in income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Psychology Behind Why Adults Still Have, and Benefit From, a 'Best Friend'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 06:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a concept often associated with childhood, having a "best friend" in adulthood provides significant psychological benefits, including higher well-being and resilience. Research shows that the quality of one's closest friendships is a more reliable predictor of happiness than the total number of friends. Best friendships are characterized by deeper levels of trust, support, and intimacy, and individuals are more willing to provide significant help to them across various situations. Psychologists note that humans subconsciously rank their social connections due to limited time and emotional energy, investing most heavily in a small inner circle of three to five people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate for the year to September was 3.8%, a figure lower than the feared 4% but still well above the Bank of England's target. This provides some relief to households and the government, particularly as food prices eased for the first time in months. However, persistent inflation in the services sector and the financial scarring from recent price spikes mean consumer confidence may remain low. While wage growth is currently outpacing inflation, the Bank of England is expected to remain cautious about cutting interest rates until price rises are more firmly under control.

          <p>A suspect in a brutal 2017 stabbing death in Arizona has been arrested in Mexico after a crucial tip was sent to the victim's family via a GoFundMe page. Michael Anthony Arredondo is accused of stabbing 25-year-old Evin Paulos approximately 30 times. The case had grown cold until September, when an anonymous person in Mexico messaged the fundraising page with the suspect's location and a photo for proof. This remarkable tip enabled a collaboration between Mexican and U.S. authorities, leading to Arredondo's capture and extradition to Phoenix, where he reportedly confessed to the killing.</p>
