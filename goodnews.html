          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes after the implementation of the REAL ID requirement for domestic flights on May 7th. The TSA emphasized that travelers must present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license, a passport, or another federally-approved form of identification, such as a Department of Defense-issued ID. The REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report to enhance federal identification standards for air travel.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping could provide temporary relief for Asian countries navigating the rivalry between the U.S. and China. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a potential diplomatic breakthrough after weeks of escalating tensions. However, this detente might also complicate the strategic calculations of these countries as they seek to balance trade relations with China and navigate U.S. policies. Despite the positive development, some experts believe the relationship between the two powers remains fragile.</p>

This trend has been observed since the summer of 2024, as more mainland companies turn to Hong Kong's stock exchange for capital infusions.
