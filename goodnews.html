          <p>The U.S. dollar index has reached its lowest level in three years, prompting consideration of its implications for U.S. markets and the economy. A weaker dollar generally benefits U.S. companies' overseas business by increasing foreign buyers' purchasing power. While there may be increased costs for imported supplies, the net effect is often positive for earnings. Investors should monitor consumer behavior, particularly travel demand, as a weaker dollar makes international travel more expensive for U.S. citizens but more affordable for foreign tourists visiting the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The script lets Lucy say and do all the crass things that usually belong to the rom-com villainess, but the film is ultimately about self-actualization.
