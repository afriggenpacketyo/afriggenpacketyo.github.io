          <p>Shares of ImmunityBio Inc. experienced a significant increase due to positive investor sentiment fueled by the company's recent earnings report. ImmunityBio narrowed its net loss and saw a substantial rise in revenues, driven by the strong performance of its immunotherapy treatment, Anktiva, for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The company is experiencing steady growth as urological practices increase their use of Anktiva, especially in rural areas where patients previously lacked access to such treatments. This expansion opens up new markets for ImmunityBio's therapies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli for New Jersey governor, praising him as a 'terrific America First Candidate' who will work to grow the economy, cut taxes, secure the border, and stop 'woke' policies. Ciattarelli, once a critic of Trump, has seemingly aligned with his agenda, prompting a response from both Democrats and his Republican primary opponent, Bill Spadea. The New Jersey Democratic Governors Association criticized the endorsement, stating that Ciattarelli would put Trump before New Jerseyans, while Spadea claimed Ciattarelli was lying about his record.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI-powered humanoid robots to revolutionize its manufacturing sector, aiming to maintain its economic growth and global manufacturing dominance. The government is providing substantial subsidies and support to humanoid robot firms, with over $20 billion allocated to the sector and a $137 billion fund established for AI and robotics startups. Chinese companies are rapidly developing increasingly agile and capable humanoid robots, leveraging AI and data collection to create robots that can perform various tasks in factories and elderly care facilities. While concerns exist about potential job displacement, Beijing views this technology as crucial for addressing labor shortages and maintaining its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has urged countries to unite to promote global peace and stability, cautioning against tariff wars in a veiled reference to the US. Speaking at the China-Celac forum in Beijing, Xi emphasized that 'bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation.' He called for solidarity in the face of geopolitical tensions, unilateralism, and protectionism, highlighting the importance of fairness and justice. Xi announced five programs to enhance cooperation between China, Latin American, and Caribbean countries, including coordination on international affairs and deepening trade through the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 90-day pause in the trade war with China, lowering tariffs in both countries, leading to a market rally. The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by the US has arrived, following Trump's declaration of a 'genocide' against Afrikaners. Democrats are fighting Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar, while Trump hails the release of the last living US citizen held in Gaza.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent auction of the Riggio family's art collection at Christie's in New York showed signs of a cooling art market, with many objects presold and little enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the subdued sale to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While the collection totaled $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. The top lot, a Mondrian painting, sold for $47.6 million, less than the previous record for a Mondrian. The 20th Century Evening Sale fared slightly better, but the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market.</p>
