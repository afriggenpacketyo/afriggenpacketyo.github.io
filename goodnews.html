          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has signaled a more conciliatory approach towards China, aiming to secure Beijing's cooperation on critical global issues like the war in Ukraine and climate change. During recent discussions, von der Leyen used a softer tone while addressing Europe's significant trade concerns, including market access and export controls on key materials. This shift in rhetoric reflects the EU's strategic need to engage with China as a major global power, balancing assertive trade policies with the necessity of partnership on international security and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>The collectible Labubu dolls, rabbit-like monster plushes, have become a viral fashion accessory, leading high-end luxury brands to collaborate on premium versions of the toy. Originally inexpensive blind box items, customized Labubus from brands like Sacai and A-Morir are now fetching thousands of dollars, with Parisian fashion house Moynat set to release its own collection. This trend reflects a broader strategy in the luxury market to engage younger, digitally-savvy consumers by partnering with popular characters, similar to successful collaborations involving Pokémon and Snoopy. Analysts suggest these partnerships tap into an emotional connection that resonates with Gen Z buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for pattern day traders, a rule that has been in place since 2001. If approved by the SEC, the change would make active day trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The new rule would instead base a trader's intraday buying power on the margin requirements of their positions, reflecting modern market technology and access. This move is expected to increase trading volume, particularly in options, and could benefit brokerage firms like Robinhood. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, making homeownership more affordable. For a $250,000 mortgage at this new rate, the monthly principal and interest payment is approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs translates to over $54,000 in interest savings over the life of the loan, prompting a surge in both new mortgage applications and refinancing inquiries from homeowners.

          <p>Recently retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce has voiced strong disapproval of the NFL's expanded jersey number rules, which allow more position groups to wear single-digit numbers. On his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce expressed his frustration that the new system eliminates the tradition of being able to identify a player's position simply by their number. He argued that linemen and other "big body" players should wear traditional, higher numbers, stating he dislikes seeing defensive ends wearing numbers like 1 or 11, as it detracts from the sport's classic aesthetic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low following a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to carefully consider their options before entering the market. Experts suggest buyers should first determine the actual interest rate they are eligible for based on their credit score, as it may differ from the national average. It's also important to explore alternatives for securing a lower rate, such as paying for mortgage points or considering an adjustable-rate mortgage. Finally, buyers must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to fall further against the possibility that they could rise again, as seen in previous market cycles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. With current average rates, a 15-year loan would cost approximately $779 per month, while a 10-year term would be around $989 per month. These payments are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year, providing modest savings for borrowers.
