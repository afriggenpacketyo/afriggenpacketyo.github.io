          <p>Warren Buffett announced his intention to recommend Greg Abel as his successor as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year during the annual shareholder meeting. Buffett, 94, stated that Abel's designation as CEO successor was decided in 2021, and he would still remain to assist. Buffett also clarified that keeping every share is an economic decision as he believes Berkshire will have better prospects under Abel's leadership. Abel, 62, currently serves as the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, but it is not yet confirmed whether he will also assume the role of chairman. Optimism that Abel can lead Berkshire Hathaway to future success is high.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is facing economic uncertainty due to a decrease in consumer sentiment and changes in eating habits, according to CBS News. Owner Stanley Kallivrousis notes a decline in foot traffic and customers sharing meals or opting for smaller portions. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index has dropped, and restaurant operators report declining traffic. Kallivrousis has paused expansion plans and faces difficulty retaining staff, as some workers leave for the gig economy.

          <p>Capital One sees a path to make its acquisition of Discover Financial even more profitable by expanding Discover's payment network internationally. The company's estimate of $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027 has two main buckets: Expense savings and network benefits. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that global expansion of Discover's network will create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business. The debit-card business will receive a distinct regulatory benefit from running on the Discover network: It will no longer be subject to the so-called Durbin amendment, which put a cap on the swipe, or "interchange", fee that can be charged for each debit-card transaction.
