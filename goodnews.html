          <p>France is leading a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move positions Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty, especially after its merger with OneWeb. However, industry experts are cautious about its potential to challenge Starlink, citing significant disparities in scale; Eutelsat operates 650 low Earth orbit satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. Analysts believe that while Eutelsat may succeed in specific security and enterprise markets, achieving parity in the mass-market broadband sector remains a distant goal. (not investment advice)</p>
