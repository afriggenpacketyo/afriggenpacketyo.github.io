          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in a remote region of British Columbia, Canada. He survived by building a makeshift shelter, drinking pond water, and foraging for food. To attract attention, he carved the word "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led a search helicopter to his location. Though severely dehydrated and suffering a leg injury, Barber's survival skills were credited for his endurance. Rescuers noted that he was fortunate to have been found when he was, as his condition was deteriorating rapidly.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are projecting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025. The official COLA is calculated based on the average inflation for July, August, and September, so the final figure remains subject to change. The projection is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which rose 2.5% over the last year. The potential impact of new tariffs on inflation in the coming months could also influence the final adjustment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. This growth was fueled by a 90% increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which reached $61.3 billion. Despite the strong revenue, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, largely due to non-cash charges related to its IPO. Circle's CEO highlighted surging interest from major financial institutions following the passage of new crypto legislation, and the company announced a new proprietary blockchain called Arc.

          <p>Paraguayan ministers have proposed a new law to encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported components, many of which would come from China. The plan aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by allowing companies to shift from importing fully assembled products to manufacturing them domestically. Officials see a strategic opportunity in current global trade dynamics, particularly U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods, which could position Paraguay as an attractive assembly hub. The proposal comes as Paraguay debates its long-standing diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of establishing relations with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached record highs following a July inflation report that was slightly cooler than expected, increasing odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The rally was notably supported by the financial sector, with both Goldman Sachs and BlackRock hitting all-time highs. In technology news, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the Threads social network has surpassed 400 million monthly active users. While this marks solid growth, the platform is still in the early stages of monetization and is not yet a significant revenue contributor for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the safety and viability of reverse mortgages for seniors seeking to supplement their retirement income by tapping into their home equity. As federally regulated products, primarily through the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, they offer protections like ensuring the loan balance never exceeds the home's value. However, the tool is not without risks; borrowers must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance to avoid default. The accumulating loan balance also reduces the equity available for heirs. The article advises that these loans are best for seniors planning to age in place long-term.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley's Chief Strategist, Mike Wilson, has presented a surprisingly bullish outlook on the stock market, suggesting the current rally is only in its early stages. He argues that the market's significant drop in the spring already priced in a potential economic slowdown, clearing the way for a new bull run. Wilson believes that tariff-induced inflation will likely subside later this year, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to begin a significant rate-cutting cycle in 2026. This environment, he predicts, will fuel a rebound in earnings and cash flow, leading him to favor Industrials and Financials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has made a surprising, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to purchase Google's Chrome browser. The offer comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in the antitrust lawsuit the company recently lost regarding its search market monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered conversational search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal, which exceeds its own current valuation. Google has previously called the DOJ's proposal a "radical interventionist agenda" and has not yet disclosed how it will adjust its business following the ruling.</p>

The popularity of her home-based sales, which saw lines wrapping around her house, gave her the confidence to leave her career and open a physical storefront last year.
