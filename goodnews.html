          <h2>China Removes 300 Dams and Hydropower Stations to Restore Yangtze River Habitat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and shut down numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. The initiative aims to revive the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species, which has been severely degraded by decades of water flow obstruction. These structures had blocked migratory routes and reduced water volumes, sometimes causing sections of the river to dry up entirely. This large-scale project represents a significant shift in policy to prioritize ecological recovery in one of China's most vital river systems.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player, widely reported to be American athlete Montrezl Harrell of the Adelaide 36ers. The arrest is being hailed by Basketball Australia as a "landmark moment" in the fight against online abuse targeting athletes. The man was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass, or offend and has been released on bail. The incident and subsequent police action underscore a growing commitment by sports organizations and law enforcement to hold individuals accountable for online hate speech.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a rapid boom in electric heavy truck sales, which are quickly gaining market share and significantly curbing the nation's demand for diesel fuel. Driven by government subsidies and a fast-expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This shift is causing analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate projections for when China's overall oil consumption will peak. The trend, following the rise of electric cars and LNG trucks, marks another major blow to fossil fuel use in the world's largest crude importer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has identified 38 new mineral reserve locations in the first half of the year, a crucial step in its strategy to enhance national resource security. The Ministry of Natural Resources reported a 31% year-on-year increase in such discoveries, which include significant reserves of rubidium and gold. Investment in exploring for critical minerals like tin, bauxite, and copper—essential for aerospace, semiconductors, and green energy—also rose sharply. These efforts are part of a broader push to strengthen China's domestic supply of strategic resources amid a competitive global race for these materials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling signaling she will order the Trump administration to stop conducting unlawful immigration stops and arrests. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by civil rights groups arguing that federal agents have been targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause, creating terror in communities and harming the local economy. In the hearing, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong questioned the government's lack of specific evidence justifying the arrests. A final order is expected soon in the case, which has become a key legal battle over the administration's mass deportation strategy.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles, trapping them underground. An initial group of 27 was trapped, and four colleagues went in to help before the rescue operation commenced. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and thankfully, none of the workers sustained visible injuries. The collapse occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project. Cal/OSHA is now investigating the incident, and the project has been put on hold indefinitely.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling grants a temporary hold in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order violates the 14th Amendment. This decision was made in accordance with new Supreme Court guidelines on universal injunctions, though the White House has condemned it as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the high court's authority. The government has been given seven days to appeal the ruling, continuing the legal battle over the contentious policy.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. The decision comes after 46 years of imprisonment for his role in a series of murders that terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s. Bianchi, now 74, and his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. impersonated police officers to lure, sexually assault, torture, and murder at least 12 women. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the parole board determined Bianchi remains a risk and will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years, ensuring he remains incarcerated for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite weighing over 54 pounds that is expected to sell for up to $4 million. The meteorite, named NWA 16788, was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, with only about 400 officially recognized out of over 77,000 meteorites found on our planet. This particular specimen represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on Earth, offering a significant opportunity for scientific study and private collection.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable and highly improbable discovery, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science found a dinosaur fossil deep beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped bone fragment, believed to be a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur, was unearthed from a 750-foot-deep bore hole drilled to study geothermal energy potential. Museum curators described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to a "hole in one from the moon." The fossil dates back approximately 67.5 million years to the late Cretaceous period and is now on display, representing the deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery in Denver.</p>

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe, after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans centered around eight key words: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. In his new book, he argues these words act as "emotional shortcuts" that resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. While not a guarantee of victory, they serve as powerful building blocks for crafting memorable messages, unlike highly specific slogans like "Get Brexit Done." The article also notes the growing influence of AI in creating hyper-personalized campaign messages, potentially signaling the end of traditional slogans.</p>
