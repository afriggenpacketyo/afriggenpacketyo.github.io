          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on South Korean goods, a lower rate than the previously threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for U.S. projects and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. Interpretations of the investment fund's control differ between Washington and Seoul, with South Korea emphasizing its role in helping Korean companies enter the U.S. market. The deal avoids tariffs on U.S. goods entering South Korea and exempts semiconductors from higher global rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution, civil rights violations, and defamation, claiming he was targeted for political or professional gain. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice due to a lack of significant action, giving Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile. An attorney for Baldwin stated they have been in good-faith settlement discussions and characterized the dismissal as a temporary non-event while those talks continue.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's own operators. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. The group claims its proposal would be cheaper, less risky, and could be fully operational by 2035, offering a distinct alternative for the UK government to consider. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the long-debated expansion project.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue, which climbed 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The growth was driven by a significant increase in funded customers, which rose by 2.3 million to 26.5 million, and a near doubling of total platform assets to $279 billion. The company has seen success with its aggressive deposit-matching campaigns and the growth of its Robinhood Gold subscription service. While revenue from crypto and equities trading was slightly below forecasts, this was offset by strong performance in options trading and net interest revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani had to leave his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning because of cramping. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound, losing his command after three solid innings. After a brief mound visit with the manager and trainer, he was removed from pitching duties but was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter. This was only Ohtani's seventh start of the season as he continues his return from his second Tommy John surgery.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Explanations for Tsunami Formation and Behavior</h2>

          <p>Following the recent Pacific tsunami, experts explain the science behind these powerful ocean waves. Tsunamis are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes, particularly those with significant vertical movement of the seafloor, like the recent 8.8 magnitude quake off Russia. The waves travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, which makes them so destructive. Forecasting remains challenging, but deep-ocean sensors are improving prediction accuracy, providing critical time for warnings and evacuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in Pacific Ocean trenches. The Chinese-led research team captured images of vast beds of clams, bacterial mats, and fields of tube worms, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme pressure and darkness. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that such chemosynthetic communities may be more widespread in the deep ocean than previously thought.</p>

          <p>A growing debate within the scientific community is questioning the long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's development. Some UK scientists and psychology professors argue that concrete evidence for negative outcomes is weak, and many studies rely on flawed self-reporting data. They suggest factors like loneliness may be more significant drivers of mental health issues than screen use itself. However, other researchers maintain that increased screen time correlates with rising depression rates and displaces crucial activities like sleep and in-person interaction, creating a complex and divisive issue for parents and policymakers.</p>

          <p>High-resolution imaging has unveiled the stunningly intricate tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The scans revealed detailed decorations of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures that were previously not visible to the naked eye, showcasing a high level of sophistication. Researchers collaborated with a tattooist who specializes in ancient methods to better understand how the decorations were created. The findings suggest the tattoos were likely stenciled and then applied with multi-pointed tools, offering a closer look at the practices of this ancient nomadic warrior culture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8 magnitude event off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly limited tsunami damage outside its immediate vicinity. Scientists explain that the tsunami's primary energy was directed into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching heavily populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with the timing of low tides in some areas like California, meant that the U.S. West Coast was spared a catastrophic event. The outcome serves as a best-case scenario for a distant, powerful earthquake.</p>
