          <p>A unique, prefabricated off-grid retreat called "The Nest" has been installed on a remote peak on Keats Island, British Columbia, requiring a helicopter for placement. Designed by Daria Sheina Studio, the structure consists of two rotated, stacked cuboid volumes and was assembled on-site in just two days. The cabin is entirely self-sustaining, featuring solar panels for power, a rainwater collection system, and an incinerating toilet. Its design emphasizes a minimal environmental footprint and a deep connection with the surrounding nature.</p>

She described the condition as making one feel "a little slothy" but expressed relief in understanding the cause. The actress is now managing the disorder with medication and has resumed exercising.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated for September, savers may question the value of opening a high-yield savings account. However, financial experts argue these accounts remain a worthwhile option for several key reasons. Current rates, around 4.25%, are still substantially higher than those of traditional savings accounts, ensuring better returns on deposited funds. Furthermore, any rate reductions are expected to be gradual and small, meaning high-yield accounts will likely maintain their advantage for the foreseeable future while offering greater flexibility than CDs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological findings at Pompeii suggest that some survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live in the devastated city. Researchers believe these individuals, likely unable to relocate, established an informal settlement amid the ruins, living in "precarious conditions." Evidence shows that upper floors of old houses were inhabited while ground floors were repurposed as cellars with ovens and mills. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that the city was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event, revealing a more complex story of survival.</p>

          <p>Connected fitness company Peloton reported a surprise profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, with net income reaching $21.6 million, a significant turnaround from a loss in the prior year. This positive result was driven by better-than-expected sales and aggressive cost-cutting measures. Despite the profit, new CEO Peter Stern announced another round of layoffs, impacting 6% of the company's global team, as part of a plan to save an additional $100 million. The company's strategy focuses on stabilizing its finances and returning to sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that a 90-day extension of the current tariff truce with China is likely. Speaking on Fox News, Lutnick stated that while the final decision rests with the president's trade team, it seems probable that an agreement to extend the deadline will be reached. This signal of de-escalation comes as the U.S. implemented sweeping worldwide tariffs on dozens of other countries. The current truce with China was set to expire, and an extension would provide more time for ongoing bilateral trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified human remains found in a hiking boot as belonging to David White, a fisherman who vanished nearly 28 years ago in Utah. In 1997, White's empty boat was found on Fishlake, but he was never located. This May, a boot containing a human foot was discovered on the lake's shore, and investigators noted the shoe was manufactured just before his disappearance. DNA testing confirmed a 99.99% paternal match between the remains and White's daughter, finally bringing a measure of closure to his family after decades of mystery.</p>
