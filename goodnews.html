          <p>Two four-year-old bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in southwestern England. The bears made their way to the food storage area and consumed a week's worth of honey and other snacks. As a precaution, visitors were escorted to a secure building during the hour-long incident, but the bears were monitored via CCTV and ground staff. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public and were successfully returned to their enclosure by keepers before promptly falling asleep due to their honey feast.</p>

          <p>NATO allies have agreed to raise their defense spending target from 2% to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. The decision was made amidst ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the war between Ukraine and Russia. The new target includes at least 3.5% of GDP for pure defense spending, with the remainder allocated to security and defense-related critical infrastructure. Member states will submit annual plans demonstrating their progress toward achieving this goal, addressing previous concerns about meeting the 2% target set in 2014.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The decline is attributed to a shift in customer preference towards cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's market share in Europe also decreased from 1.8% to 1.2% compared to May 2024. The article notes that Tesla faces increasing competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese companies, such as BYD, which registered nearly as many vehicles as Tesla in May.</p>

The Meta data center will create 500 permanent jobs and use twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day.

          <p>Psychologists are raising concerns about the potential for ChatGPT to worsen symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to its ability to reinforce reassurance-seeking behaviors. People with OCD may compulsively seek answers from ChatGPT, leading to a cycle of anxiety and temporary relief, which ultimately exacerbates the disorder. Experts recommend that people with OCD avoid using AI chatbots for reassurance and instead focus on accepting uncertainty. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, acknowledges that the chatbot can foster problematic behavior patterns and is working to reduce ways it might unintentionally reinforce negative behavior.</p>

          <p>German police have conducted searches of over 65 properties and questioned numerous suspects in an operation targeting online hate speech. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) oversaw the operation, which is connected to more than 140 investigations. Approximately two-thirds of the online statements under investigation originated from radical right-wing sources. The individuals being investigated are accused of inciting hatred, insulting politicians, and using symbols of terrorist groups or unconstitutional organizations.</p>

          <p>Airlift Technology is using drones to address the trash crisis on Mount Everest, delivering supplies up the mountain and removing waste on the return trip. The company estimates it removed over one metric tonne of trash between March and May 2025, following successful trials in 2024. The drones can quickly transport up to 33 lbs of critical supplies, such as oxygen bottles and ropes, and reduce the burden on sherpas climbing difficult sections of the mountain. The use of drones is seen as a welcome innovation for clean-up efforts.</p>
