          <p>The U.S. has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, identifying it as the group responsible for the April attack in Pahalgam, India, that killed 26 people. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, another designated terrorist group. The move was welcomed by India as a significant step in U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. The April 22 attack, which targeted mostly Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, led to a major escalation of hostilities between India and Pakistan before a ceasefire was reached.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Utilizes Generative AI for Visual Effects in Original Series to Reduce Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:51:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has confirmed its first-ever use of generative artificial intelligence for final visual effects in one of its original shows, the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that the technology was used to create a scene of a building collapsing, allowing the production to achieve complex sequences faster and at a significantly lower cost. This development comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry, where AI is a major concern for creative professionals who fear it could devalue or replace human labor. The announcement coincided with Netflix reporting strong quarterly earnings, with a 16% rise in revenue to $11 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The space technology sector saw a significant influx of investment during the second quarter, reaching $3.1 billion and marking a substantial increase from the previous period. According to a report from Seraphim Space, this rally was driven by sustained interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment. U.S. firms attracted the majority of the funding, with year-to-date investment in American space companies already surpassing the total for all of 2024. The report highlights strong momentum for emerging areas like in-orbit servicing and space habitats, signaling robust investor confidence in the sector's long-term growth potential.

          <h2>Heat-Seeking Fire Beetle Inspires Advanced Infrared Detection Technology in China</h2>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, an insect capable of detecting faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This biomimicry has led to a system that is reportedly 20,000 times faster than conventional infrared detectors. Such technology is crucial for military and industrial applications, as it can penetrate smoke, fog, and dust to provide clear imaging and accurate detection in challenging environments. The fire beetle's unique pit organ evolved to help it find the residual heat from wildfires, which provides the ideal conditions for its larvae to hatch and thrive.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing multi-front wars and internal political turmoil, Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has surged over 200% from its post-attack low, buoyed by significant foreign investment and renewed confidence following its conflict with Iran. Israel's high-tech sector, which constitutes 20% of its GDP, has been a primary driver of this economic resilience. Analysts credit the country's dynamic tech market and a perception of diminishing security risks for attracting global investors, who have poured billions into Israeli shares this year.

          <p>Tom Lynagh, son of Australian rugby legend Michael Lynagh, is set to make his first Test start for the Wallabies at fly-half against the British and Irish Lions. The 22-year-old was thrust into the pivotal role following an injury to first-choice fly-half Noah Lolesio. Lynagh, who was eligible to play for England and Italy, chose to pursue his career in Australia five years ago, a decision that is now paying off on one of rugby's biggest stages. Despite his limited international experience, totaling just one hour of game time off the bench, coaches praise his composure, toughness, and kicking ability.</p>

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida after a U.S. and Turkey-mediated ceasefire halted days of intense clashes with local Druze militias. The conflict, which killed nearly 600 people, had escalated significantly, drawing in neighboring Israel, which conducted airstrikes in defense of the Druze community. Under the new truce, Druze factions and clerics will now be responsible for internal security in the province. The fighting began after tit-for-tat attacks between local Sunni Bedouin tribes, who sided with the government, and the Druze factions, threatening to destabilize Syria's post-war transition.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by successfully building and operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. The inventor, identified only as Zhang, said he was fascinated by invention since childhood but was inspired to build a submersible after seeing one on a state television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine, and began constructing the vessel in secret. His creation, a sleek black craft, has been seen slicing through a local river, fulfilling a lifelong dream of building a machine that could travel underwater.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite this moderation, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that while the trend is moderating, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs could reintroduce inflationary pressures and pose risks to the economic outlook.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on U.S. defense spending but stated they are now committed to increasing their own contributions. In an interview, Merz emphasized that Russia poses a significant threat not just to Ukraine but to the peace and political order of all of Europe. His comments come as Germany leads a significant increase in its defense budget and works to strengthen a trilateral alliance with the UK and France. Merz said he believes he is on the same page as U.S. President Trump regarding the need to end the war in Ukraine.</p>
