          <p>Tom Brady, the NFL legend, experienced the thrill of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway firsthand, joining NASCAR icon Jimmie Johnson for a lap in a two-seater IndyCar before the start of the Indy 500. Brady expressed his excitement to FOX broadcast while wearing a FOX Sports fire suit and IndyCar helmet. Michael Strahan, another NFL star, drove the pace car to lead the drivers to the green flag. The race was temporarily delayed due to rain, and early incidents included crashes by Scott McLaughlin during warm-up laps and Marco Andretti on the first green flag lap.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Style Focuses on Attunement and Resilience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attuning to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Unlike stricter or softer approaches, it prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, seeing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and take responsibility after conflicts. This approach aims to create an environment where children feel safe expressing big emotions and showing up as their authentic selves, fostering a calm and steady authority.</p>

          <h2>Tommy Paul Wins French Open Match After Truck Repossession</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but his post-match comments focused on the recent repossession of his truck due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had switched banks and forgot to update his automatic payments, leading to the repossession of his Ford F-150. He discovered the truck was gone after his trainer noticed it missing on security camera footage. After regaining possession of his truck, he found the whole experience humorous.</p>
