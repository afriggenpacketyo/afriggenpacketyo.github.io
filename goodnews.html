          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The stock price jumped over 16% on Friday, adding to a 33% increase on Wednesday following the news of the bill's passage. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments, with companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring their use. The GENIUS Act seeks to provide consumer protections, collateral requirements, and regulatory oversight for stablecoins, potentially paving the way for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>

          <p>Shubman Gill marked his captaincy debut with a century, complemented by Yashasvi Jaiswal's impressive ton, as India reached 359-3 on the first day of the Test match against England. Following the retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Gill's ongoing partnership with Rishabh Pant, who is currently at 65 not out, underscored the strength of India's batting lineup. England's decision to field first after winning the toss is under scrutiny, as their bowlers struggled to capitalize on available swing. Despite the challenging start, England aims to leverage the ground's history of come-from-behind victories, though weather forecasts favor India's pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers in the House of Commons voted to pass a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill will now undergo scrutiny by the House of Lords. The bill proposes that adults over 18 with less than six months to live could receive assistance to end their lives, subject to safeguarding checks. The vote marks a significant step towards a major change in social policy in the UK.</p>
