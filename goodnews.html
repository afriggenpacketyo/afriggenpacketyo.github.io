          <p>A "60 Minutes" feature highlights the story of Rob Vanderslice, a renowned lowrider artist from Española, New Mexico, known for his intricate vehicle paint jobs. The article details his personal journey, from being deeply involved in gang culture and drug addiction to achieving over 13 years of sobriety. Vanderslice now uses his artistic talent to mentor young people in his community, teaching them to build and paint lowrider bicycles as a way to keep them out of trouble. His personal car, painted to represent his transition "out of the darkness, into the light," symbolizes his transformation and commitment to positive change.</p>

          <p>Lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is undergoing a significant transformation, shedding its historical association with gangs and crime to become a celebrated art form and a force for community good. The article explores how lowriders, once seen as menacing, are now embraced as a vital part of the region's heritage, with events like "Lowrider Day" in Santa Fe marking a cultural shift. The community, led by figures like Arthur "Low Low" Medina, now uses the cars' appeal to organize charitable drives and mentor at-risk youth. This evolution represents a redefinition of rebellion, focusing on healing and providing hope in areas facing social challenges.</p>

          <p>The nonprofit organization Healing Justice, founded by sexual assault survivor Jennifer Thompson, brings together crime victims and exonerated individuals from different cases for healing retreats. The article details how these retreats use shared stories and therapeutic activities to help participants process the trauma of wrongful convictions, which harms both the innocent and the original victims. By creating a space for mutual understanding, the program helps survivors of crime see the exonerees' suffering and allows the exonerated to find empathy. The process fosters unlikely bonds and helps all parties mend the deep wounds left by failures in the justice system.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain was framed as much by its pre-match and halftime spectacles as by the soccer itself, resembling an American Super Bowl. The event in New Jersey featured a military flyover, performances by Robbie Williams and Coldplay, and a red carpet for celebrities, with US President Donald Trump in attendance alongside FIFA's Gianni Infantino. This lavish production, complete with a high-tech stage and heavy security, highlighted a significant effort to create a major global entertainment event. The spectacle even delayed the start of both halves of the game.</p>

          <p>Dr. Daniel Amen, a psychiatrist and brain imaging specialist, warns that sacrificing sleep to watch television can have detrimental effects on brain health. He explains that during sleep, the brain cleanses itself, and cutting this process short impairs memory, focus, and energy the following day. This lack of proper rest can lead to poor decision-making. The article also notes that exposure to blue light from screens before bed can disrupt melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Dr. Amen advises prioritizing sleep and using blue-light blockers to maintain cognitive function and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>In an address, Jim Cramer urged investors to separate their political feelings about President Trump from their investment decisions, noting the stock market's surprising resiliency. He posits that despite institutional selling, individual investors are driving a bull market, possibly due to a pro-business environment and deflationary pressures from artificial intelligence. Cramer argues that changes at the federal agency level are fostering a pro-capitalist environment, encouraging dealmaking and deregulation that benefits stocks. He concludes that while one might dislike the president's methods, the economic policies and technological trends are creating a bullish environment for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his R&B roots in a rawer and more improvisational style than previous projects. The album reflects a tumultuous period for the artist, featuring murky production, demo-like tracks, and lyrics that frankly address the pressures of his life and marriage. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee and Dijon, Bieber embraces a scrappy, idiosyncratic sound that aligns with modern pop trends. The review describes the 21-track LP as shaggy, disarming, and often beautiful, arguing it's his most authentic and instinctual work to date.</p>
