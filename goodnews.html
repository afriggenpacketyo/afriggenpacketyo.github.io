          <p>Goldman Sachs has reported third-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions, driven by strong performance in its investment banking and fixed-income trading divisions. The company's profit saw a significant 37% surge compared to the previous year, with revenue climbing 20% to $15.18 billion. This robust performance is attributed to increased market volatility, which benefits trading desks, and a recent uptick in merger and IPO activities. The bank's positive results reflect broader favorable conditions for Wall Street firms. (not investment advice)</p>

The new policy will limit teens' exposure to content related to topics like drugs, alcohol, and sexualized media, and will hide accounts that promote adult-themed content. This change follows sustained criticism from lawmakers and the public regarding the platform's impact on youth mental health and safety. The rollout will begin in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries before expanding globally.</p>

          <p>Retired England cricket star Stuart Broad has voiced his opinion that Australia's current team is their "worst" since England's last Ashes series victory down under in 2010-11. Responding to predictions of an Australian sweep, Broad suggested that while Australia remains the favorite at home, they face significant question marks, including the fitness of captain Pat Cummins. He argued that the combination of a weaker Australian side and a stronger English team creates the potential for a highly competitive and compelling Ashes series.</p>

CEO Jamie Dimon noted the strong performance across business lines but also cautioned about heightened uncertainty from geopolitical conditions and potential inflation.

          <p>A recent survey by German health insurer AOK indicates that the vast majority of employees in Germany are not worried about artificial intelligence replacing them in the workplace. Only about 5% of respondents expressed concern that AI could threaten their job security within the next five years. This widespread lack of concern exists despite studies suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in Germany involve tasks that could be automated. The survey also highlighted a significant knowledge gap, with less than 40% of employees having received any formal training on AI.</p>

          <p>Incumbent Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, setting up a challenge against long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins.

          <p>California has passed a new package of legislation aimed at protecting children online, addressing growing concerns over artificial intelligence and social media. One landmark law requires AI chatbots to disclose that they are not human and to prompt minors to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful content. Other new laws mandate that social media platforms add mental health warnings and require device makers to implement age verification tools in their app stores. These measures position California at the forefront of regulating Big Tech to prioritize the safety of young users.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for their research into how technological innovation drives sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work focuses on how the Enlightenment in Britain created a culture that applied scientific breakthroughs to practical economic use, sparking the Industrial Revolution. Aghion and Howitt are recognized for developing the theory of "creative destruction," which explains how new technologies and businesses replace outdated ones, a disruptive but essential process for long-term progress. Their collective work provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of modern economies.</p>

          <p>A new drug named lenacapavir is being hailed as a potential game-changer in the fight against HIV, offering nearly 100% efficacy through a simple injection administered just twice a year. This breakthrough could overcome major hurdles associated with daily prevention pills, such as adherence and stigma, which have limited their global impact. Following successful clinical trials and approval from major health organizations, the Trump administration plans to roll out the drug in several low-income countries. However, challenges related to equitable distribution and pharmaceutical pricing will determine its ultimate success.</p>
