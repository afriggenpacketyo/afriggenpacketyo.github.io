        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his center-left Labor Party have secured a second term, overcoming earlier poll deficits attributed to a cost-of-living crisis. The victory is seen as a rejection of conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, who aligned himself with some of Donald Trump's policies. In his victory speech, Albanese emphasized Australia's independent approach to global challenges, highlighting a desire to avoid simply copying other nations. Voters expressed concerns about the rising cost of living and a lack of bold ideas from either party to address fundamental issues, especially Australia's reliance on the US for defense and China for trade.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, falling to $9.64 billion, largely due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profits caused by Southern California wildfires. The company also cited a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange. Warren Buffett warned that tariffs could further negatively impact profits. The insurance-underwriting profit plummeted by 48.6%, and Berkshire suffered losses due to the dollar's decline in value against other currencies, highlighting the challenges faced by the conglomerate in the current economic environment.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil rights groups, led by the African American Policy Forum (AAPF), has launched a week-long campaign to protest Donald Trump's attacks on Black history and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The campaign, called Freedom to Learn, includes educational sessions, demonstrations, and a Black history challenge to counter Trump's executive orders targeting institutions like the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). The initiative aims to emphasize that Black history is integral to American history and to resist efforts to erase or marginalize difficult chapters of the nation's past. The groups are concerned about Trump's broader efforts to eliminate DEI efforts at all levels of government.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber is leading the institution's fight against the Trump administration's efforts to cut federal funding and strip its tax-exempt status, but he also agrees with Trump on the need to address campus culture issues. Garber acknowledges that Harvard has often excluded dissenting voices and allowed antisemitism to go unchecked, and he has initiated changes to student discipline, protest management, faculty hiring, and diversity programs. While defending Harvard against federal intrusion, Garber is also attempting to shift the campus culture, facing pushback from students who believe the changes prioritize optics over values.

The indicator's recent dip comes as the S&P 500 has rebounded 12% from April lows.

          <p>A new training program called CHAT aims to reduce "elderspeak," a form of communication that sounds like baby talk and is often used with older adults, by educating caregivers on respectful and adult-centered language. Studies show that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care and other negative behaviors. The CHAT program has proven successful in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors, as well as potentially lowering the use of antipsychotic drugs. By promoting respectful communication and addressing older people as adults, individuals and institutions can improve the quality of care and well-being of older adults.</p>

          <p>Seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan announced his intention to leave the UK and relocate to the Middle East. The announcement came after O'Sullivan's defeat in the World Championship semi-finals, his first tournament since a cue-snapping incident in January. O'Sullivan, who lives in Essex and has a snooker academy in Saudi Arabia, did not specify the reasons for his move, but he is an avid critic of the high tax rates in the United Kingdom.</p>
