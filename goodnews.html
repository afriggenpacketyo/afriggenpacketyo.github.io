          <p>University of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders commented on a surprising and consistent aspect of home games at Folsom Field: the distinct smell of marijuana. In an interview, Sanders noted that the scent becomes particularly noticeable during a TV timeout in the second quarter of every game. He humorously referred to it as the "light-up" quarter. Sanders, who is entering his third season as coach, stated that he has never been high and finds the recurring phenomenon new to him. The Buffaloes are set to open their season at home against Georgia Tech.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-value ranches are being listed for sale as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out their inheritance. Brokers report a surge in inventory of these legacy properties, driven by family disagreements and a lack of interest from younger generations in ranching. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, who seek privacy and a rural lifestyle. While selling provides a financial windfall, it also marks the end of a family's long-held connection to the land and a unique way of life.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, narrowly ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso. Despite his strong showing, Alonso downplayed his chances of competing with the McLarens for a front-row start in Saturday's qualifying. Norris's teammate, Oscar Piastri, finished third, underscoring McLaren's strong pace heading into the weekend. Several drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, experienced spins or went off track as they navigated the challenging circuit, with rain expected to impact Saturday's sessions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in ending the protections. The court noted that Congress designed the TPS system to be dependable and insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who fled political and economic crisis in their home country, though the long-term status remains part of an ongoing legal battle.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed close contacts that she does not plan to run for a third term in 2026, with a formal announcement expected next week. Ernst, who has served in the Senate since 2015 and holds a Republican leadership position, had previously told associates she intended to serve only two terms. Her decision adds to a growing list of Republican senators not seeking reelection, a development that could impact the party's efforts to maintain control of the chamber. Several Iowa Democrats have already announced their candidacy for the seat.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom, legislative leaders, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft have announced a compromise deal that would permit drivers to unionize while maintaining their status as independent contractors. The agreement involves advancing a bill for collective bargaining alongside a separate bill, backed by the companies, that lowers their insurance coverage requirements. This development marks a significant milestone in the long-running debate in California over labor rights for gig economy workers. The deal is being presented as a compromise that empowers drivers while also aiming to reduce costs for passengers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details recent breakthroughs in understanding and treating chronic pain. The book highlights a shift in research toward a "bedside-to-bench" approach, where scientists study patients' real-world experiences to identify objective biomarkers for pain in the brain. This has led to groundbreaking trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and intercept pain signals before they are felt. While not yet widely available, this research demonstrates that the brain's pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering hope for new, non-surgical therapies.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with President Trump was marked by apparent personal chemistry, easing fears of a contentious meeting. Lee's preparations, which included studying Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," seemed to pay off as key proposals, like a plan to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding, were received favorably. However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare the summit a definitive success. Several major issues, including trade details, defense cost-sharing, and the potential relocation of U.S. troops, remain unresolved and will be subject to further negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief. This article outlines the qualification requirements for several common options. Traditional debt consolidation loans typically require a credit score above 650 and a manageable debt-to-income ratio. Debt forgiveness programs are for those facing severe financial hardship with significant unsecured debt, while debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies require enough income to meet a structured repayment schedule. Other options include internal hardship programs from credit card issuers and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the potential returns for savers considering a $30,000 certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. Based on today's rates, such a deposit could earn anywhere from over $300 on a 3-month term to more than $6,700 on a 5-year term. The primary benefit of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which protects savings from future rate cuts and provides predictable growth. However, this comes with a trade-off, as funds are locked in for the duration of the term, unlike more flexible options like high-yield savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

The resolution means subscribers will not miss out on major sporting events, including a highly anticipated college football game and the upcoming NFL season.</p>
