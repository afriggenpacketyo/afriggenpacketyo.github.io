          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has departed from his role as the Doctor in Doctor Who after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler. The BBC's press release acknowledges the Doctor's regeneration but teases the mystery behind Piper's return. Gatwa reflected on his unforgettable journey and the role's lasting impact, while Piper, known for her roles in Secret Diary of a Call Girl and Scoop, previously expressed doubt about playing the Doctor herself. This marks the shortest tenure for an actor in the role since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Mookie Betts missed a game against the Yankees after fracturing his toe while walking to the bathroom in the dark. Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to be day-to-day and does not anticipate him going on the injured list. Betts is currently having a down year, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs, and this injury follows a similar incident where Freddie Freeman missed games after slipping in the shower. The Yankees and Dodgers will continue their three-game series.</p>

Fearnley, making his French Open debut, appeared to sustain an injury during the second set. Norrie could potentially face Novak Djokovic in the next round.</p>

          <p>This article addresses reader questions regarding Medicare enrollment and capital gains taxes on home sales. It clarifies that delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties unless covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan with 20 or more employees. The article also distinguishes between the home sale exemption, which allows excluding up to $500,000 of profit from taxation, and 1031 exchanges, which defer capital gains on investment properties if a similar property is purchased within 180 days.

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees but later corrected the figure. The public was advised to avoid the area, and beekeepers assisted in re-hiving the bees, with the goal of saving as many as possible. The road where the incident occurred was closed for about 24 hours to allow for the recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The classic New York City bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich has seen a price increase at a Brooklyn bodega due to rising costs of ingredients like eggs, bacon, and cheese. The owners of El Vacilon Grocery, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, had to raise the price for the first time since 2019 to maintain their profit margin. Despite the challenges, the bodega remains a staple in the neighborhood, serving up to 60 sandwiches a day and relying on rent from apartments above the store to stay afloat. The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, known as a "bandera" at El Vacilon, is a ubiquitous symbol of the city's bodega culture.</p>

It suggests that while buzzwords are intended to convey pithy meaning, they often impede trust and create insecurity among employees. The article argues that using real, human language is more effective than relying on metaphors and jargon. It encourages individuals to speak plainly and suggests that if one enjoys metaphors, they should read poetry instead.</p>
