          <p>General Motors confirmed its full-year financial guidance despite reporting a $1.1 billion impact from auto tariffs in the second quarter, which met expectations. The company's earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street estimates, though net income and margins declined year-over-year. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to reduce its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and other cost-saving initiatives. The automaker anticipates further tariff impacts in the second half of the year but does not plan specific price increases for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The increasing prevalence of AI-generated content, or "AI slop," across the internet is degrading the quality of online resources and may encourage people to spend more time in the real world. From dating apps to informational YouTube videos, AI-generated text and media are making it harder to trust online information and interactions. The author argues that this decline in the internet's utility and fun, coupled with the difficulty of distinguishing real from fake, could inadvertently help cure internet addiction. This shift might lead to a renewed appreciation for offline activities, physical media, and face-to-face social connections.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel, who canceled his tour in May after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, recently provided an update on his health. The 76-year-old singer described a primary symptom as poor balance, comparing the feeling to "being on a boat." While the condition, which involves fluid buildup in the brain, is still being treated and is not yet fixed, Joel assured fans he feels good and that the disorder sounds worse than his current physical state. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is more common in people over 65 and is often treatable.</p>

          <p>Financial technology startup Imprint has won a competitive bid to launch a new co-branded credit card with the online shopping platform Rakuten, a significant victory in an industry dominated by large banks.

          <p>An expedition exploring the wreckage of the USS DeHaven, a US destroyer sunk during World War II, has discovered remarkably preserved artifacts including its bell and intact torpedoes. The ship sank in February 1943 near the Solomon Islands, with 167 crew members lost. The Ocean Exploration Trust used remotely operated vehicles to capture high-resolution footage of the wreck, located in an area known as Iron Bottom Sound. This exploration provides valuable data for historians and maritime heritage managers, offering a new glimpse into a pivotal moment in naval history and honoring the memory of those who served.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Crystal Palace has filed an appeal with the Court of of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against UEFA's decision to demote them from the Europa League to the less prestigious Conference League. The punishment was issued due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor has stakes in both Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. Palace argues that Textor does not have decisive influence over the club and is seeking to be readmitted to the Europa League. If the appeal fails, Nottingham Forest is expected to take their place in the competition.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the upcoming August 12 deadline for a trade deal with China is likely to be extended. The current 90-day suspension of most heavy tariffs was set to expire, but Bessent stated that an extension will probably be arranged during upcoming talks in Stockholm. He described the trade relationship with China as being in a "very good place" and expressed hope that the talks would also cover other issues, such as China's manufacturing output and its support for Russia. This signals a potential de-escalation in the trade tensions that have characterized the relationship between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major companies like General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet surging consumer demand. A 2025 survey found that 44% of US consumers want to increase their protein intake, a trend fueled by fitness culture and the use of new weight-loss medications. Companies are responding by launching new protein-fortified lines, such as cereals and snacks, and rebranding existing products to highlight their protein content. The trend has also spawned new startups, like Protein Pints ice cream, indicating a significant and potentially lasting shift in consumer dietary preferences.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has officially announced it will introduce a version of its classic soda made with US cane sugar, following a social media post by President Donald Trump claiming he had secured the change. In an earnings call, CEO James Quincey clarified this would be an "and" strategy, complementing its existing portfolio which primarily uses high-fructose corn syrup in the US. The move comes amid a wider "Make America Healthy Again" campaign, although health experts note there is little nutritional difference between cane sugar and corn syrup. The new product will appeal to consumers who prefer the taste of sugar-sweetened Coke, like the popular "Mexican Coke."</p>

          <p>A licensed psychotherapist and author argues that the common advice to "just be yourself" is flawed and can be counterproductive. The expert contends that people have multiple "selves" and that our behavior is heavily influenced by our nervous system's state, making authenticity a complex concept. Instead of raw self-expression, which can be an excuse for poor behavior, she advocates for "self-leadership." This involves being aware of one's different internal parts and consciously choosing how to act in alignment with one's values, fostering better relationships and personal growth by focusing on responsibility over rawness.</p>

          <p>While corporate travel spending increased 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, businesses are approaching it with caution due to trade tensions and economic uncertainty. A report from the Global Business Travel Association moderated its 2025 growth forecast, citing these pressures. Companies are being more strategic, prioritizing individual, relationship-building trips over large group events and seeking more efficient travel options. This trend suggests that while businesses still see value in face-to-face meetings, they are carefully managing expenses in a fluid economic environment, a sentiment echoed by major airline executives.
