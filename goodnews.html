          <p>A British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who are in their 70s and 80s, had lived in the country for decades running a charitable training program. They were reunited with their daughter in Qatar following negotiations brokered by the Qatari government. Despite the harrowing conditions of their detention and health concerns, the couple expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their work, highlighting their deep connection to the nation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from closing its plant in Granite City, Illinois, a move that will preserve nearly 800 jobs. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights the government secured as a condition of the company's recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel. The national-security agreement grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. The intervention highlights a more hands-on approach by the administration in the private sector to protect American industrial jobs and manufacturing capacity.</p>

          <p>In an interview with The Atlantic, Monica Lewinsky reflects on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She discusses her decision to re-enter the public eye to help others who have experienced public shaming, inspired by the tragic story of Tyler Clementi. Lewinsky explains how younger generations, unswayed by the political narrative of the time, helped shift the perception of her story. She emphasizes the importance of telling one's own story to reclaim it from a media-driven version and find healing.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the UK, and Asia, driven by the high cost of domestic education and the turbulent political landscape in the U.S. Experts note a significant increase in interest since the 2024 election, with consultancy firms seeing a surge in inquiries. For many, the lower tuition fees abroad present a compelling alternative to accumulating substantial student debt in the United States. While studying overseas offers unique cultural experiences, some students express concern about being less prepared for the U.S. job market upon graduation.</p>

          <p>Louisa Serene Schneider, a former Wall Street executive, successfully launched Rowan, an ear-piercing business that now generates $70 million in annual revenue. The idea originated from her search for a safe piercing option for her daughter, leading to a business model where registered nurses perform the procedure. Starting from her attic with an at-home service, the company has grown to 90 studios across the U.S. by focusing on safety and a celebratory customer experience. Schneider's journey highlights the potential of identifying and filling a niche market, even while facing initial skepticism from investors.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologist Warns of Unseen UV Ray Exposure Indoors Near Windows</h2>

          <p>A leading dermatologist is cautioning that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even while indoors, particularly when sitting near windows. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, contributing to accelerated aging and increasing the risk of skin cancer without any visible burning sensation. To mitigate this "silent" exposure, he recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on days spent primarily inside.</p>

It suggests that acknowledging these feelings is a positive sign, as a "true phony" rarely questions their own authenticity. The piece offers practical advice for combating these self-doubts, with a primary recommendation being to avoid negative self-talk and treat oneself with more compassion. By understanding the psychological roots of this phenomenon, individuals can develop healthier perspectives on their own talents and accomplishments.</p>

New legislation in Rhineland-Palatinate will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers, allow families to keep urns at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes. These changes cater to a growing demand for more personalized and less traditional forms of mourning, as cremation rates rise and the role of conventional cemeteries diminishes.
