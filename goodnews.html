          <h2>British Athlete Claims Record-Breaking Run Across Australia for Charity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, asserts he has broken the record for the fastest run across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days, pending Guinness World Records verification. Goodge ran approximately 100km daily, starting from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and ending at Bondi Beach, with his father present at the finish line. He undertook the run to raise money for cancer charities, inspired by his mother's death from cancer in 2018, and faced challenges like dust storms and injuries during the journey. Some members of the running community have questioned the accuracy of his tracking data, but Goodge maintains the integrity of his record keeping.</p>

          <p>After decades of attempts to locate the remains of Eli Cohen, a celebrated Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, Israel has acquired a trove of documents and personal effects from Syria, as reported by The New York Times. The collection, retrieved through a joint effort between the Mossad and an allied foreign government, includes documents, photographs, and handwritten letters from Cohen's time undercover. Cohen's intelligence work in Syria during the early 1960s is credited with significantly contributing to Israel's victory in the Six-Day War and the capture of the Golan Heights.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the perception of Max Verstappen winning in an "inferior car" by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of McLaren and Red Bull cars across different track characteristics. McLaren's superior qualifying pace and race results are highlighted, with the car performing better in slower corners and races where rear-tire degradation is an issue. Red Bull, however, excels in high-speed corners, making tracks like Suzuka, Jeddah, and Imola favorable for Verstappen. The article also notes that Red Bull has introduced upgrades recently, potentially shifting the performance balance, and quotes McLaren team principal Andrea Stella on the factors influencing car performance.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. This initiative hopes to leverage the high solubility of CO2 in water and the carbon absorption capabilities of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with various organizations to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of these carbon capture and storage projects, with Japan aiming to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a celebrated Russian ballet choreographer and former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, has passed away at the age of 98. Known for revitalizing male dance and creating demanding roles for men, Grigorovich's productions like 'Ivan the Terrible' and 'Romeo and Juliet' redefined Soviet ballet. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first-ever dancers' strike at the theatre in its 200-year history.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge in their Hong Kong trading debut, rising over 18% as investors expressed confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market.
