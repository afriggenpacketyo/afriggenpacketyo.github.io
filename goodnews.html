          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal messaging app during a Cabinet meeting a day before President Trump announced his replacement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed Waltz had been texting with figures like Vice President JD Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of Signal, stating it's an approved app, however the Pentagon's internal watchdog criticized a former official's use of the Signal app in 2021, calling it a breach of the department's records retention policies. Trump nominated Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has become the head of four government bodies, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security adviser to President Trump. This accumulation of titles has sparked questions about his ability to effectively manage all these positions, especially with Steve Witkoff handling sensitive diplomacy. Trump announced Rubio's newest position unexpectedly, leading to confusion even within the State Department. The article explores the implications of Rubio holding multiple high-level roles and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>President Trump removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, temporarily replacing him with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources suggest Waltz was ousted due to the Signal situation and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff, though he was given a high-profile new post. Some officials believe the Trump administration thought Waltz would struggle to be confirmed by the Senate.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, leading to a decline in share prices after hours, with the company citing "tariff and trade policies" as factors impacting its forecasts.

The company expects sales of $159 billion to $164 billion for the current quarter, with operating profits potentially shrinking to $13 billion. CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon is focused on keeping prices down by purchasing extra inventory in advance of tariffs and assisting sellers on Amazon's marketplace.</p>

While Apple's reliance on Chinese factories made it vulnerable to the trade war, the company is diversifying its supply chain to reduce risks.

Japan is considering proposals to increase purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and expand tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice.

While some may have doubts about the future, the decision to remain child-free is a personal choice made with careful consideration.
