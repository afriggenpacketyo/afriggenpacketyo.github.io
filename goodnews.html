          <p>Owen Farrell is set to captain the British and Irish Lions in their upcoming match against the First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This marks his first start of the tour, where he will play at inside centre in a completely changed lineup from the first Test against Australia. The squad for this midweek game includes nine Scottish players and all of the tour's "geography" call-ups, with no players from the first-Test victory starting. The match provides an opportunity for players on the fringe to contend for a spot in the upcoming second Test.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Assess Singapore Dollar's Potential as a Global Safe-Haven Currency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to its stability and strong institutional backing. While it currently lacks the global status of the US dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc, the SGD has shown defensive qualities during financial stress. Experts point to Singapore's prudent fiscal policies and unique monetary management, which controls the currency's value against a trade-weighted basket, as key strengths. However, the relatively small size of the SGD market and its managed nature present hurdles to it becoming a primary global safe haven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:07:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The James Gunn-directed film "Superman" continued its strong performance at the North American box office, earning $57.3 million in its second weekend and remaining the number one movie. The Warner Bros. and DC Studios release saw a standard 54% drop from its debut, bringing its global total to $406.8 million. This successful start is crucial for DC Studios' plan to reboot its cinematic universe, with "Superman" seen as a key pillar for its future projects. The summer box office overall is performing well, with sales up significantly compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a formidable competitor across the entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has diversified from telecommunications into a wide range of complex sectors, including AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key national champion for Beijing. Huawei's Ascend series of AI chips and its "CANN" software are emerging as direct competitors to Nvidia's dominant products, particularly within China. This strategic pivot, spurred by external pressures, has made Huawei a "jack of all trades" and a leader in monetizing industrial AI applications.</p>

          <p>The struggling Chinese rust-belt city of Hegang is investing in a new airport as part of a strategy to revive its economy and counter a shrinking population. Construction on Luobei Airport, a 1.2 billion yuan project, is set to begin soon and is scheduled for completion in 2027. The city, located in Heilongjiang province, has experienced years of industrial decline and has seen its population drop significantly. Officials hope the new infrastructure, designed to handle 450,000 passengers annually, will boost economic growth and improve connectivity, potentially leveraging trade with nearby Russia.

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face federal charges of drug and arms trafficking. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is linked to the surge in violence that has transformed Ecuador and is blamed for trafficking a majority of the world's cocaine through the country's ports. The extradition follows a referendum where Ecuadoreans voted to allow the practice to combat rising crime.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 agonists, the class of drugs including Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing potential as a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. While not yet an approved use, some patients and small studies report significant improvements in PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances after using the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps regulate hormones, addressing a core metabolic issue linked to PCOS. However, experts call for larger clinical trials and note that high costs and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concern over looming trade tariffs, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are poised to support the stock market. He points to a strong earnings season, significant consumer-focused tax relief in President Trump's "big beautiful bill," and pro-business spending incentives as major economic stimulants. Cramer also highlights massive required investments in data centers and the electric grid, a loosening of bank lending restrictions, and a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector. He contends these powerful domestic tailwinds will create a pro-growth environment that could overshadow the negative impacts of international trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to tackle a looming crisis where future pensioners are projected to be worse off than today's retirees. New analysis from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) warns that people retiring in 2050 could be £800 a year poorer, as four in ten working-age adults are not saving enough. The commission will address stark disparities, noting that millions of self-employed workers and most low earners are not contributing to a private pension. It aims to build a national consensus on a strategy to boost retirement savings for all. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The founder of SpinQ, a Shenzhen-based quantum computing company, predicts the technology will cross a critical "usefulness" threshold within the next five years. CEO Xiang Jingen compared the current state of quantum computing to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, on the cusp of a major transition. SpinQ, founded in 2018, develops and sells a range of quantum products, from small-scale educational computers to more powerful industrial-grade superconducting systems. The company's forecast suggests that practical applications for this advanced technology may be closer than many anticipate, moving beyond its current experimental phase.</p>
