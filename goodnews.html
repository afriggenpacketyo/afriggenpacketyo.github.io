          <p>Prince Harry visited Kyiv, Ukraine, following an invitation from the Ukrainian government to show his support for those injured in the war with Russia. The Duke of Sussex expressed his commitment to aiding the recovery process of military personnel, and is scheduled to present new initiatives through his Invictus Games Foundation. He previously visited the Superhumans Trauma Centre in Lviv, where he met with war victims undergoing rehabilitation, emphasizing the importance of humanizing those affected by the conflict. He stated that while the war cannot be stopped, efforts can be made to support the recovery process. The Prince recently met with his father King Charles in London, marking their first meeting since February 2024. The Duke hopes to make an impact on the lives of those impacted by the war. </p>

          <p>Great Britain is set to compete against Poland in Gdynia for a chance to win the Davis Cup next year. Jack Draper is unavailable due to injury, but Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley are expected to have a significant ranking advantage over their opponents. Captain Leon Smith cautioned against underestimating the Polish team, despite their lower rankings, as tennis can be unpredictable. Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash will debut as the world's number one doubles pair, and Poland is missing their top two singles players due to injuries. A win is crucial for Britain to maintain their elite status, while a loss would mean a February play-off that could result in relegation. The team hopes to win this year and keep in the top group. </p>

          <p>A wedding crasher mystery from four years ago has been solved after an internet search. Michelle and John Wylie noticed a stranger in their wedding photos and couldn't identify him, but after an appeal to content creator Dazza, the man was identified as Andrew Hillhouse. Hillhouse had mistakenly attended their wedding after being given the wrong venue by his partner, who was supposed to be in the bridal party at another wedding nearby. He realized his mistake during the ceremony but felt he couldn't leave, so he stayed and even appeared in the group photos. The mystery man was relieved that he was finally identified. </p>

Rooney and Shaun Wright-Phillips also spoke about the pressures faced by their footballing children, with Rooney's son Kai playing for Manchester United's Under-18 team.

          <p>The new Housing Secretary, Steve Reed, affirmed the government's commitment to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, emphasizing the need to address the housing crisis. He threatened sanctions on developers who delay construction, while industry leaders warned of challenges in meeting the target due to rising costs and regulatory hurdles. The government's pledge to end housing asylum seekers in hotels could also increase pressure on housing. Reed aims to streamline the planning process and collaborate with developers to accelerate construction, but faces skepticism from the Conservatives.

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill that would override local zoning laws to allow for high-density housing near public transit hubs. The bill now requires a final Senate concurrence vote and the governor's signature to take effect. It allows for taller, denser housing near transit corridors, with up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain transit stops. Supporters say the bill is necessary to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics argue it strips local authorities of their ability to manage growth. The bill has spurred protests, but gained support after a deal with a labor group. The passage of the bill could change the landscape of housing in California. </p>

President Lee Jae Myung expressed concerns that the raid would deter companies from investing in the US.

The South Korean foreign ministry has called for US Congress to support a new visa for Korean firms. The Hyundai CEO stated that the raid will delay the factory's opening.

The album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern flavors, featuring instruments like the sitar, tabla, and santoor. Sheeran collaborated with Indian superstar Arjit Singh on the song Sapphire, singing in English, Hindi, and Punjabi. However, the album's integration of these cultural influences is subtle, assimilating them into his existing pop style. While some tracks retreat to safer ground, others showcase Sheeran's raw talent and adventurousness. The artist is trying to break new ground. </p>
