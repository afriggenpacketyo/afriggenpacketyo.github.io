          <p>Harvard mathematician Liu Jun clarified his reasons for leaving the United States to return to China, stating the decision was personal and not a political statement. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu explained that his move was motivated by family considerations and a deep connection to the Tsinghua University campus where he was born. He explicitly denied that his departure was related to the Trump administration or any professional dissatisfaction with his role at Harvard. His response aims to quell speculation surrounding the motivations of high-profile academics moving between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank announced its decision to hold interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely influenced by U.S. trade policies. The bank's key deposit rate remains at 2%, following a rate cut in June. ECB officials noted that inflation is currently near their 2% target but emphasized a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach without pre-committing to a future rate path. Projections for economic growth in 2025 were revised upward to 1.2%, though concerns remain about the impact of tariffs on investment and exports in the eurozone.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being integrated into the travel industry, offering consumers new ways to plan and book trips that can save time and money. AI-powered tools like chatbots and specialized apps can generate itineraries, compare fluctuating prices, and maximize loyalty points, effectively acting as personalized travel agents. While some industry experts praise these tools for their efficiency in research and booking, others find their current value is greater for on-the-ground assistance, such as translating menus in foreign countries. Companies like Expedia are leaning into the technology, allowing users to turn social media videos into bookable travel plans.</p>

          <p>Construction of a new freeway interchange on I-5 at Steilacoom-DuPont Road in Pierce County, Washington, is reaching a key milestone with the installation of massive girders. The Washington State Department of Transportation is warning drivers of nightly lane and ramp closures as crews move seventeen steel and concrete girders, each over 150 feet long and weighing 170,000 pounds. This project will create a new overpass that extends over the nearby railroad tracks, eliminating traffic backups caused by passing trains. The interchange, along with an extension of the HOV lane, is expected to be completed next spring.</p>

          <p>Marc Lasry, former co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, expressed his disbelief regarding allegations that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer circumvented the NBA's salary cap. The controversy stems from a report that a company Ballmer invested in gave Clippers star Kawhi Leonard a $28 million sponsorship deal that was allegedly a covert payment. Lasry, who has known Ballmer for a long time, described him as honorable and stated he doesn't believe there was pressure to skirt the rules. The NBA has launched an investigation into the matter, which both Ballmer and the Clippers organization have denied.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs survey of 245 global family offices reveals a significant shift in investment strategy among the ultra-wealthy. These investment firms have increased their average allocation to public equities to 31%, while reducing their private equity holdings from 26% to 21% over the past two years. This move towards a more "pro-risk asset mix" comes despite growing concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation. The survey also indicates that investing in public stocks and ETFs is the preferred method for family offices to gain exposure to the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Since joining the Dallas Mavericks in 2018 and later being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, he has amassed numerous accolades, including NBA Rookie of the Year. However, he is also a polarizing figure, often criticized for his defensive effort, fitness, and frequent complaints to referees. Despite these criticisms, Doncic remains a dominant force in the league, demonstrating a deep emotional connection to the game and his teams while consistently delivering elite performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of teenagers babysitting, once a common rite of passage, has declined as the job becomes more professionalized and dominated by adults. This shift is attributed to factors like increased safety concerns, busier teen schedules, and the rise of intensive parenting, which places higher expectations on caregivers. The article argues that this trend represents a loss for both teens and younger children. Babysitting provides teenagers with valuable skills in responsibility and critical thinking, while younger kids benefit from the playful energy of an older, but not adult, role model, fostering unique community and social bonds.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for gender equality, South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that a law preventing husbands from taking their wives' surnames is unconstitutional. The case was brought by two couples who argued the existing legislation was archaic, patriarchal, and discriminatory. The court's ruling overturns the previous law, and Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the change. The decision was supported by legal bodies who argued that restricting a man's choice perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes by denying them an option available to women.</p>

The initiative, estimated to cost 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), involves building a new double-line, five-stage lock system to ease traffic congestion at the critical Yangtze River hub. Described as the largest integrated project on the river since the original dam, it is scheduled to span more than eight years of construction.

          <p>This article presents a photographic look back at the monumental public health campaign to vaccinate Americans against polio in the 1950s. At its peak in 1952, the disease caused thousands of deaths and left over 20,000 people paralyzed in the U.S. alone. The introduction of a widely available vaccine in 1955 marked a turning point in the fight against the devastating virus. Within a decade of the vaccine's rollout, the number of polio cases in the country plummeted to fewer than 100 per year, demonstrating the world-changing impact of the mass vaccination effort.</p>
