          <p>Matt Cross from Lincolnshire was crowned the World Conker Champion, a first-time winner in the event's 60th year. The competition, held in Northamptonshire, saw 256 participants from nine countries. This year featured 'airport-style' security checks following a cheating scandal in the previous year, which had ironically boosted public interest. Cross, surprised by his victory, attributed his success to force and accuracy, acknowledging the game's element of chance. The event also overcame fears of cancellation due to a hot, dry summer affecting conker availability, with nuts sourced from Windsor Castle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, formalizing the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays, has sparked public debate. Tabloids initially mischaracterized it as 'extra holidays,' but legal experts clarify it merely formalizes an existing practice based on religious freedom. This reflects a broader national conversation about integration and cultural identity, as Germany's federal system allows states to regulate religious holidays differently. The clarification aims to acknowledge the constitutionally protected religious freedom of the Muslim population, aligning with existing allowances for other faiths.</p>

Healy's chanceless 107-ball innings, featuring 21 fours and three sixes, masterfully dictated the chase, demonstrating exceptional mental fortitude after keeping wicket for nearly 50 overs. This victory, eclipsing Sri Lanka's previous record, positions Australia as strong contenders in the tournament, showcasing their depth and Healy's crucial form.</p>

          <p>This article outlines seven habits parents should avoid to raise mentally strong children, based on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships. Key advice includes allowing children to experience and overcome struggles to build resilience, modeling imperfection and taking responsibility for mistakes, and validating rather than silencing big emotions. The article also emphasizes valuing children beyond their achievements, granting them a voice in decisions, managing parental emotions independently, and demonstrating the importance of rest to prevent burnout. These practices help children regulate emotions, trust themselves, and rebound from setbacks, fostering emotional safety and independence.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where a Gaza peace plan is set to be signed. Starmer will commend US President Donald Trump for his role in brokering the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. While the UK claims a 'key role' in shaping the plan, this assertion has been disputed by US Ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israel's deputy foreign minister. The summit aims to solidify the ceasefire, facilitate humanitarian aid, and establish a framework for lasting peace and security in the region, marking a critical turning point after two years of conflict.</p>
