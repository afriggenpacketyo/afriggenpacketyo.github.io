          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 22:01:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson criticized the Indiana Pacers' physical style of play during their playoff game, suggesting they crossed a "line of physicality" that led to injuries for Evan Mobley and DeAndre Hunter. Atkinson highlighted specific plays where he felt the Pacers' actions were excessive and resulted in non-calls that contributed to the injuries. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle defended his team, stating that Atkinson was merely protecting his players and that disagreements are common in heated playoff series. The NBA fined Carlisle $35,000 in May 2024 for criticizing referees. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite months of previously belittling Canada. While the two leaders discussed trade and other issues, Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale," pushing back against Trump's past suggestions of merging the two countries. The meeting, while cordial, was freighted with awkwardness due to Trump's previous rhetoric. Trump touched on various topics during the meeting, including domestic issues and foreign policy matters unrelated to Canada. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>The Met Gala faced criticism after some felt that two first-time attendees, Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh, were dismissed at the event. During an interview with Khan, Vogue's livestream hosts appeared unaware of his global fame, while Dosanjh was barely acknowledged. Many fans expressed disappointment online, feeling that the South Asian superstars did not receive the respect they deserved. A representative for Vogue stated that it was unintentional for the livestream to cut away from Dosanjh so quickly. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>A plant in China's Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from low-grade ore previously unusable. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur in low-grade bauxite, allowing it to be refined using the Bayer process. In 2023, IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement the technology. This development aligns with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry and could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminum ore. Optimism Score: 75</p>
