He presents ten reasons for optimism, including strong corporate earnings, the economic stimulus from proposed tax cuts, and massive private spending on data centers and the electrical grid. Cramer argues these domestic economic drivers will outweigh the impact of trade disputes, potentially leading to a continued market boom. (not investment advice)</p>
