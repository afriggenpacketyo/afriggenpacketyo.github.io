          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have announced a comprehensive deal aimed at resetting relations after Britain's departure from the bloc. The agreement covers areas such as security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, with British officials hailing it as a 'historic day' and a 'new chapter' in their relationship. Key provisions include easing import and export processes for food and drink, establishing a new 'Security and Defence Partnership,' extending fishing rights for EU trawlers, and simplifying travel for British holidaymakers and their pets. Both sides will also explore a 'youth experience scheme' to facilitate work and travel for young people across the continent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce new regulations for the 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) sector, aiming to protect shoppers from potential debt traps. The proposals will require BNPL firms, such as Klarna and Afterpay, to conduct upfront checks to ensure consumers can repay what they borrow and to provide easier access to refunds. Consumers will also have the ability to escalate complaints to the Financial Ombudsman, a service that resolves disputes between consumers and financial services firms. These rules are designed to bring a sense of order to what City Minister Emma Reynolds described as a 'wild west' in the BNPL space.</p>

          <p>Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker, anticipates US trade tariffs will cost the company approximately $150 million annually. This follows President Trump's implementation of a 10% tariff on UK and European imports into the US. To mitigate the impact, Diageo is launching a $500 million cost-saving program aimed at supporting further investment and improving its financial leverage. The company reported a 2.9% increase in net sales for the recent quarter, driven by strong Guinness sales, but noted a dip in European sales due to 'softness' in spirits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. According to analysts at Cornwall Insight, a typical household's annual energy bill will decrease by ¬£129, a nearly 7% reduction. This would bring the average annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current ¬£1,849. While this decrease is a welcome development, experts caution that prices remain significantly higher than pre-decade levels, raising concerns about affordability for many households.</p>

In Poland, Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, secured a spot in a runoff against a nationalist historian, Karol Nawrocki, though the margin of victory was narrow.
