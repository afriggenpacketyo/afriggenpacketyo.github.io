          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures potentially reaching 31°C. Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales all recorded their warmest day of the year so far, while parts of England saw highs above 33°C. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions in England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The intense heat has led to hosepipe bans and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland, with relief expected on Monday as cooler air and rain are forecasted for most of the country.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, initiating a disarmament process. This move, prompted by a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a significant step toward peace, though the PKK's full dissolution depends on concessions from the Turkish government. Key demands include Ocalan's release, legal reforms for other Kurdish political prisoners, and amnesty for fighters. A successful peace process could improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria, enhancing its overall stability and influence in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>While installing a water pipeline in the Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, workers discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed, approximately 30 inches below the ocean floor. Marine archaeologists have confirmed the shipwreck dates back to the late 1700s based on radiocarbon analysis. The discovery in the historic city, famous as a filming location for "Game of Thrones," adds to a series of recent maritime archaeological finds across Europe, and the remains are being protected for further study.</p>

          <p>On the 40th anniversary of Live Aid, the monumental 1985 charity concert is remembered for its global reach and fundraising success for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event united nearly 2 billion viewers and featured legendary music acts. However, looking back, the event faces criticism for its lack of diversity, featuring no African performers on its main stages and reinforcing a "white savior" narrative of Africa. While it successfully raised millions and influenced global aid policy, its legacy is now viewed as complex, balancing its positive impact with valid questions about representation.</p>

          <p>A campaign is growing in the UK to require cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English, not just Latin or scientific names, to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a Latin-based system, which campaigners say is inaccessible to most consumers. MP Becky Gittins and families affected by severe allergies argue that allergens should be clearly marked in plain language, similar to food packaging standards. The industry's trade association defends the current system, stating INCI provides a globally harmonized language.</p>

          <p>A new study examining the impact of China's dams on the Brahmaputra River suggests they may alleviate, rather than worsen, India's dry-season water concerns. Contrary to fears that a new mega dam in Tibet could cause a water crisis, data from two existing upstream dams shows a significant increase in water levels downstream during the dry season. Measurements taken since 2014 indicate that low flows in February rose by more than 50%. This research provides the first concrete evidence on the downstream effects, hinting that the dams' regulation of water may actually help prevent droughts.</p>
