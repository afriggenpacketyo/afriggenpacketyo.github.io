          <p>Electric air taxi manufacturer Joby Aviation is significantly increasing its U.S. production capacity to meet its goal of launching commercial service in 2026. The company announced the start of operations at a facility in Dayton, Ohio, and plans to double its manufacturing capabilities at its hub in Marina, California. This expansion, supported by a partnership with Toyota, aims to eventually produce up to 500 aircraft annually and will create hundreds of new jobs. The move reflects growing momentum in the eVTOL sector as companies race toward regulatory approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced plans to expand its production of gasoline-powered vehicles to meet sustained high consumer demand. The company will move the manufacturing of the Cadillac Escalade and add production of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, starting in 2027. This facility was previously slated to become an electric vehicle-exclusive plant, indicating a strategic adjustment by GM. The decision builds on the automaker's recent $4 billion investment in its U.S. facilities and reinforces its commitment to its profitable internal combustion engine lineup.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced it will move production of the Cadillac Escalade and add manufacturing of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, set to begin in early 2027. This decision is driven by continued strong customer demand for these gas-powered models. The Orion plant, previously being retooled for electric vehicles, will now accommodate this expansion of internal combustion engine vehicle production. This move is part of GM's broader strategy to invest in its U.S. facilities and balance its portfolio between electric and traditional vehicles to meet market needs.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified the U.S. government's position on allowing Nvidia to resume chip sales to China, stating the approved exports are not the company's top-tier technology. Lutnick emphasized that China would be receiving Nvidia's "fourth best" chip, a strategic decision aimed at keeping Chinese developers reliant on the American technology ecosystem without providing them with the most powerful AI capabilities. This policy reversal, which followed a meeting between former President Trump and Nvidia's CEO, is seen as a major win for the chipmaker, allowing it to re-enter a lucrative market under specific restrictions.</p>
