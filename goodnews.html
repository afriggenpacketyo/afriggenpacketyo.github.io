          <p>Walmart's CFO indicated that consumers could start seeing price increases later this month due to tariffs, even after recent duty reductions on imports from China. Despite this, Walmart beat quarterly earnings expectations, reporting its first profitable quarter for e-commerce both in the U.S. and globally. The company expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Walmart is working with vendors to mitigate price increases and plans to maintain its price advantage over competitors, but the speed and magnitude of the tariff-related price increases are unprecedented.

          <p>Americans for Prosperity (AFP) is collaborating with Republican representatives to target competitive House districts, advocating for the extension of President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

The focus is on states with contentious races expected in 2026, and the AFP urges Republicans to offset budget cuts by eliminating former President Joe Biden's "Green New Deal giveaways."</p>

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of "dry texting" among teenagers, where subtle changes in texting behavior indicate disapproval or conflict avoidance. This passive-aggressive communication can create ambiguity and anxiety for the recipient, leading to overthinking and uncertainty about the sender's true feelings. While technology can amplify disputes, it also transforms them into quieter, more confusing interactions, highlighting the need for teens to develop conflict resolution skills. The piece also suggests that open communication and in-person discussions can help navigate these subtle fault lines in digital communication.</p>

Despite strong quarterly sales and projected sales growth, Walmart did not issue a profit outlook for the second quarter due to the unstable tariff environment. The retailer will work to absorb the costs of the tariffs but expects to raise prices, as CEO Doug McMillon stated the magnitude of the tariffs is too significant to fully absorb.

          <p>The UK economy's growth of 0.7% at the start of the year exceeded expectations, but this level of growth is not predicted to last, and the US tariffs may have an adverse affect. Though the UK's growth rate is higher than that of other large economies, the full effects of recent policy changes are yet to be seen. A UK deal with the US last week cut some tariffs, but it is unclear when this will take effect.</p>

          <p>Liz Stead, 78, unknowingly had a criminal record for 56 years due to being a lesbian in the military, after being thrown out of the RAF in 1969 when a love letter to her then-girlfriend was discovered. Stead is now encouraging other women who may have been in contact with police or discharged from the military due to their sexuality to apply for government pardons. She is one of 40 people in England and Wales to have such convictions overturned since 2023 when the Disregards and Pardons Scheme was expanded.</p>
