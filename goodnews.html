Incumbent punter Matt Hayball is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, both graduates of Australia's ProKick academy, alongside American rookie Kai Kroeger. Only one will make the final 53-man roster, with the winner securing a contract worth around $3 million, while the others will be left unemployed.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Despite his impressive performance, the Dodgers lost 4-0, with Snell giving up three runs on two home runs by Rays slugger Yandy Díaz. Both homers took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary home field. Although the result was a loss, Snell's return is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on their rotation depth for a strong late-season push.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear front-runner among the remaining candidates. For months, potential contenders had their campaigns stalled by the possibility of her entry, but now figures like former Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are vying to build momentum. Political experts note that none of the current candidates possess statewide name recognition, making fundraising, endorsements, and communication strategies critical in the wide-open contest. The most recent campaign finance reports show a mixed fundraising landscape among the declared candidates.</p>

          <p>Romanian officials, including new President Nicusor Dan, participated in a ceremony in Bucharest to mark the European Day of Remembrance for the Genocide of Sinti and Roma. The event highlighted the need for Romania to confront its history, particularly the deportation of over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria during World War II under the Nazi-allied regime of Ion Antonescu. Speakers emphasized that acknowledging this past, known as the "porajmos" or "devouring," is crucial to combating ongoing racism and hate speech. The commemoration signals a shift in public discourse, which for decades had largely ignored Romania's role in the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency platform, is celebrating its tenth anniversary, marking a journey from a small, idealistic project to a foundational technology for global finance. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted the platform's staggering growth, which now underpins trillions in payments and is being adopted by major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank for tokenized assets. As Ethereum becomes integrated into Wall Street's core infrastructure, Buterin warns of the risk of centralization if too few large entities control the ecosystem. The focus for the next decade is on scaling the network without sacrificing its decentralized principles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's pursuit of a 374-run target to win the fifth Test against India was dealt a late blow when opener Zak Crawley was dismissed on the third day. The hosts ended the day at 50-1, needing another 324 runs for a series victory. Earlier, India built a strong second-innings total of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant 118 from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise half-century from nightwatchman Akash Deep. Despite England's bowlers toiling hard, their efforts were undermined by six dropped catches, setting up a tense and decisive final two days of the series.</p>

          <p>Toyota is preparing to enter the compact pickup market with a new model aimed at competing with the successful Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz, potentially launching around 2026. The vehicle is expected to be based on a car platform like the RAV4 or Corolla, emphasizing a comfortable ride and hybrid powertrain options, including a plug-in variant. This move is seen as a response to Ford's growing sales and fills a gap in Toyota's lineup below the larger Tacoma. The new pickup will likely be built in North America and may even be exported to Japan under new trade agreements.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, ruling that the administration cannot suspend laws protecting migrants from being deported to countries where they face torture or persecution. The D.C. Circuit Court panel's decision limits a proclamation Mr. Trump issued to close the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself, it affirmed that migrants must still be allowed to apply for other mandatory forms of humanitarian protection. The ruling represents a significant legal check on the administration's border policies.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration appeared to have unconstitutionally targeted people based on factors like their race or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed after high-profile raids in June triggered widespread protests and fear. This decision reinforces the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures for all individuals, regardless of immigration status, within the region.</p>

          <p>Amid a history of segregation that limited access to pools, organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to teach swimming to Black children and adults. Founder Paulana Lamonier aims to address the stark racial disparities in drowning rates; CDC data shows Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers. The legacy of racially segregated pools created generational gaps in swimming ability and water safety knowledge. Through scholarships and accessible lessons, these programs hope to create a ripple effect, increasing safety and fostering a connection to water for communities historically excluded from it.</p>
