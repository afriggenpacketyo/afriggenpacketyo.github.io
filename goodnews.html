          <p>Walmart has announced a partnership with OpenAI to allow customers to browse products and complete purchases directly within the ChatGPT application. This new "Instant Checkout" feature aims to transform e-commerce from a reactive search-based model to a proactive, AI-driven experience that predicts customer needs. The collaboration positions Walmart to compete with other tech giants like Amazon, which is also developing its own AI-powered shopping assistants. The move reflects a broader industry trend toward integrating conversational AI into the consumer purchasing journey to create a more seamless and personalized shopping process.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the updated tax brackets for 2026, revealing increased income limits for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate. For 2026, single filers with a taxable income up to $49,450 and married couples filing jointly with up to $98,900 will qualify for this zero-tax rate on assets held for more than one year. Financial experts note this adjustment, which accounts for inflation, presents significant tax planning opportunities for investors looking to rebalance their portfolios or realize gains without incurring a tax liability.

However, the IMF also warned that the UK is expected to face the highest rate of inflation in the G7 for both this year and the next, with prices forecast to rise by 3.4% in 2025. The report noted that despite modest overall growth, the UK's economic output per capita remains at the bottom of the G7 league table. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are advised to conduct a thorough review of their current plans, as coverage and costs can change annually. An expert outlines a five-step process that includes verifying prescription drug coverage, confirming that doctors and hospitals remain in-network, and assessing the plan's maximum out-of-pocket costs, which have been steadily rising. It is also crucial to check for changes in copay structures and evaluate the value of supplemental benefits like dental and vision coverage.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is likely to implement two more interest rate cuts this year, citing the growing economic risk posed by a significant slowdown in hiring. Powell stated that while tariffs have slightly increased inflation, there are no broader pressures that would justify keeping rates high, shifting the Fed's focus toward protecting the job market. He also suggested that the Fed may soon cease shrinking its balance sheet. This stance suggests that lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses is a priority to stimulate economic activity and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, savers are reassessing the returns offered by high-yield savings accounts. While the peak rates of over 5% or 6% are now largely unavailable, consumers can still find competitive rates in the 4.20% to 4.30% range, particularly with online banks. This is still substantially higher than the national average rate for traditional savings accounts, which currently sits at just 0.40%. Unlike CDs, these accounts provide the benefit of liquidity, allowing savers to access their funds without penalty, making them an attractive option even in a changing rate environment.
