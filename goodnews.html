          <p>Republican gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is gaining financial momentum in Ohio, securing nearly $220,000 from prominent business leaders who previously donated to Democrat Tim Ryan. Ramaswamy's campaign frames this shift as evidence of a broader political realignment in the state, with voters and donors moving away from traditional Democratic leadership. His strategists argue that his message of economic growth and fresh ideas is resonating with Ohioans who feel left behind by established politicians, signaling a strong start for his 2026 bid.

          <p>The Campbell Soup Company has announced it will remove all artificial colors from its extensive portfolio of food and beverage products by August 2026. This decision comes in response to a call from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for food manufacturers to eliminate synthetic dyes by 2027. Campbell's, which owns brands like V8 and Goldfish, will use natural sources such as paprika and beet juice for coloring, joining other major companies like Nestle and Kraft Heinz in moving away from artificial ingredients.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, marking a return to form for the team. The race was also marked by a significant controversy at McLaren, where Oscar Piastri was instructed by the team to let his teammate Lando Norris pass him for second place. The order was given after a slow pit stop for Norris had initially dropped him behind Piastri, sparking debate about the fairness of team interventions when a driver's position is altered by a pit crew error rather than on-track performance.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Black Ferns delivered a powerful and ruthless performance, defeating Ireland 40-0 to secure the top spot in Pool C of the Women's Rugby World Cup. Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout player, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the decisive match. While both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, New Zealand's dominant win establishes them as a formidable force in the tournament and serves as revenge for a loss to Ireland in the previous year's WXV1 competition.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church, making him the first millennial to be canonized. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a devout Catholic who used his computer programming skills to create a website documenting religious miracles, spreading his faith through modern technology. His canonization, celebrated at a ceremony in St. Peter's Square, is seen as an effort by the Church to connect with younger generations by recognizing a contemporary figure.</p>

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have finally arrested the driver of a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car that has been spotted illegally driving on public motorways multiple times since 2019. The 51-year-old man was tracked to his home after the vehicle, believed to be a Dallara GP2 car, was seen again on the D4 motorway. Previous attempts to identify the driver were unsuccessful because he always wore a full racing helmet. The owner now faces fines and a possible license suspension for driving the unregistered and unequipped vehicle on public roads.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, who served as Germany's foreign minister until May, has officially started her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly.

In her new role, Baerbock will chair meetings of the 193 member states and play a key part in preparations for the next UN Secretary-General election, transitioning from a national diplomat to a global moderator.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, is causing concern among some small businesses, but its impact may be limited. The majority of small businesses in the U.S. are service-based and do not directly import goods, meaning they will not be immediately affected by this change. While the article acknowledges that tariffs will lead to some price increases, it argues that the larger economic concern should be whether consumer income and wealth can continue to absorb these costs, rather than the direct impact of this specific rule change.

The material, known as AquaFung, is buoyant, durable, and biodegradable, offering a potential eco-friendly solution.

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States has found a consistent pattern of couples sharing the same mental health diagnoses. This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," was observed across multiple generations from the 1930s to the 1990s for disorders like depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Researchers suggest this could be due to shared environments, mutual understanding from similar experiences, or societal stigma limiting dating pools, indicating that people with similar psychiatric challenges often partner together.</p>

The winning numbers were drawn on Saturday, ending a three-month period without a grand prize winner. The jackpot had grown significantly as 39 consecutive drawings failed to produce a winner, fueling ticket sales across the 45 states where the lottery is played. The winners will have the option to split the prize through an annuity or a lump sum cash payment of approximately $826.4 million.</p>

          <p>A commentary article makes the case that individuals preparing for societal collapse, often associated with right-wing politics, should embrace solar energy as the most logical power source. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex and vulnerable supply chains for drilling, refining, and transport, solar power offers true energy independence with a simple, durable, and long-lasting setup. The author contends that solar panels paired with batteries provide a resilient and self-sufficient energy system, aligning perfectly with the core prepper values of individualism and self-reliance in a crisis.</p>
