        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer is now advocating for a national inquiry into grooming gangs, a shift from his earlier stance where he accused those calling for it of pandering to the far-right. This change of heart follows the release of Baroness Casey's report, which calls for a national criminal operation and inquiry to coordinate local investigations into abuse. The report also highlights issues with data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators, suggesting officials have shied away from the issue. Starmer stated that the national inquiry must address all relevant aspects, including ethnicity and the role of public officials. </p>

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family has gained backing from 55 attorneys general nationwide, resolving claims related to the opioid crisis. The settlement would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, preventing them from selling opioids in the U.S., and distribute funds over 15 years to affected states. The funds are intended to compensate victims and combat the opioid crisis, with Purdue stating the settlement will deliver overdose rescue medicines and address opioid use disorder. The previous settlement was rejected by the Supreme Court due to concerns about shielding the Sackler family from liability. </p>

          <p>A Bronx high school student is advocating for the Open Captioning Accessibility Act in New York, aiming to make movie theaters more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. The student, Sarah Lin, has seen firsthand how inaccessible movie theaters can be due to her mother's hearing loss. The act would require movie theaters to offer some showings with open captions each week. Advocates argue that closed captioning is a more reliable option than assistive devices, and they hope New York's example will encourage other states to follow suit. </p>

The company has already removed artificial dyes from some products, like Kraft Mac & Cheese, and aims to reduce their use across its portfolio.
