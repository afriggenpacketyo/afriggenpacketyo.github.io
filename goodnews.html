          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates, including shows scheduled through early July 2026, after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, exacerbated by recent performances, has caused issues with hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing as he undergoes physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds, and Joel expressed his sincere apologies for disappointing his audience. NPH is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting brain-related functions.</p>

          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to revoke Harvard University's access to a database required for enrolling foreign students. The lawsuit filed by Harvard argued that the administration's decision was retaliatory and violated free speech rights. The Trump administration claimed Harvard had not done enough to combat antisemitism, leading to the revocation of access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The ruling halts the move, which Harvard argued would erase a quarter of its student body and harm its mission.</p>

          <p>Dave Nadig, an ETF expert, predicts a massive increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to a change by the SEC allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes. The number of ETFs could rise from around 4,000 to over 7,000 within a month, creating a challenge for investors to navigate the expanded market. While many new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, investors should be cautious about new, complex strategies. Nadig notes that active management in ETFs is becoming more popular, but investors should be mindful of historical performance and fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting nuclear power development in the U.S., with the goal of ushering in an "American nuclear renaissance." The orders are intended to ensure American energy dominance and provide safe, reliable, and affordable energy. The executive actions will expedite nuclear reactor testing, streamline applications, and allow the Department of Energy and the Pentagon to build reactors on federal land. The orders also call for overhauling the Nuclear Reactor Commission and encouraging uranium mining and enrichment. Officials hope to test and deploy new reactors before the end of Trump's term.</p>
