          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, including employer contributions, reached a new record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employee deferrals hit 9.5%, with companies contributing 4.8%, bringing the combined rate closer to the recommended 15% savings target. A significant portion of the increased employee deferrals came from auto-escalation features, which automatically increase savings rates over time. Experts recommend saving at least enough to receive the full employer 401(k) match to maximize retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is considering the nomination of Michael Boren to oversee the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of disagreements with the agency. Boren, an investment consultant and ranch owner, has faced disputes over building a cabin, clearing land, and managing water resources within the Sawtooth National Forest. Senator James Risch addressed these conflicts, stating that disputes between private landowners and the federal government are common in the West. Boren expressed his commitment to making forest management more resilient and healthy, emphasizing the importance of timber production on federal lands.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a pairing that defies current scientific understanding of planet formation. The planet, named TOI-6894b, is a gas giant with a radius slightly larger than Saturn but only half its mass. It orbits its star in just over three days, making it the smallest star known to host a gas giant. Scientists are puzzled by how such a small star could form and host such a large planet, as it challenges the core accretion theory. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to study the planet further, potentially revealing more about its composition and formation.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which disrupted the typical seasonal pattern last year. The GII.17 strain drove a record wave of outbreaks, causing the norovirus season to start earlier than usual. The CDC is monitoring whether this strain will remain dominant and cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season again. Other countries also experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus following the surge of GII.17.</p>

          <p>Private equity professionals at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin are expressing increased optimism about investment opportunities in Europe, reversing the negative sentiment from the previous year. Factors contributing to this shift include falling interest rates, Germany's fiscal package, and increased political stability in France, Germany, and the UK. While institutional investors have shown lackluster appetite for Europe-focused private credit funds, asset managers are expanding their presence in Europe in anticipation of new opportunities. Digital infrastructure, energy efficiency, and defense are identified as key areas with growth potential.</p>

          <p>Following recent acquisitions, Liverpool is reportedly targeting additional players to strengthen their squad, including Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez. Wirtz is seen as a key acquisition for Liverpool, and the club is willing to pay a record transfer fee for him. Kerkez, a left-back from Bournemouth, is also a target to bolster the defense. The potential arrival of Kerkez raises questions about the future of existing left-backs Andy Robertson and Konstantinos Tsimikas, with Tsimikas being the more likely candidate for departure.</p>

Despite Lee's past criticism of Japan, experts believe he will prioritize collaboration due to the current international climate. To strengthen bilateral ties, Prime Minister Ishiba should seek to build personal trust with Lee through summit talks to maintain trilateral cooperation with the United States.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas for thousands of years before European colonization, caused by a different species of bacteria called Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Researchers analyzed ancient remains from Canada and Argentina, finding evidence of the bacteria species spread rapidly across the continent. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Europeans introduced leprosy to the Americas via Mycobacterium leprae. The presence of lepromatosis in the archeological record will improve understanding of pre-colonial disease and help monitor modern cases of leprosy.</p>

The move marks a departure from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east.
