          <p>Nearly two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, a report revisits how the storm's aftermath, which collapsed the city's court system, also became a catalyst for change. Before the hurricane, the public defender system was critically broken, and the disaster exacerbated its failings, leaving incarcerated individuals in limbo for extended periods. However, the catastrophic event cleared the way for long-needed reforms. This article explores the transformation, finding that the city's public defender system is now vastly improved compared to its pre-Katrina state.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock soared after the e-commerce platform reported second-quarter results that beat analyst estimates and offered strong guidance for the third quarter. The company's revenue grew 31% year-over-year, and it projected continued growth in the mid-to-high twenties, suggesting it is managing the impact of U.S. tariffs better than feared. Shopify's CFO stated that a potential hit from tariffs, which was factored into previous guidance, "did not materialize," and the company has not seen a drop in U.S. demand.

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has granted Amazon's self-driving vehicle unit, Zoox, an exemption from some federal motor vehicle safety standards. This regulatory approval is a crucial step that paves the way for Zoox to conduct demonstrations of its purpose-built, autonomous robotaxis on public roads. As part of the decision, the NHTSA also closed a safety probe into Zoox's self-certification that its vehicles met federal standards. The move is seen as a significant milestone for the company as it prepares to launch a commercial ride-hailing service.</p>

          <p>A litter of four rare Barbary lion cubs has made its public debut at a Czech zoo, representing a hopeful step in a plan to reintroduce the breed to the wild. The subspecies, which once roamed North Africa, has been extinct in the wild since the 1960s due to human activities. The cubs are part of an international endangered species program that coordinates captive breeding to maintain genetic diversity. While a full reintroduction into their native habitat is a distant goal, preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities are underway.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump described talks between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as "highly productive," stating that "great progress" was made toward ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting occurred just days before a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant new sanctions. Following the talks, the White House indicated that President Trump is open to meeting with both President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Despite the positive tone, secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners are still expected to be deployed.</p>
