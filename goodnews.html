          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay $511 million to settle a criminal case with the U.S. Department of Justice for conspiring with American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts from 2010 through 2021. The DOJ stated that Credit Suisse AG committed new crimes and breached its May 2014 plea agreement. UBS, which acquired Credit Suisse in 2023, stated it was not involved in the underlying conduct and has zero tolerance for tax evasion. UBS voluntarily disclosed information about identified accounts to the Justice Department and cooperated by undertaking an investigation into the identified accounts.</p>

          <p>Palantir increased its revenue guidance after experiencing a boom in both commercial and government revenue. CEO Alex Karp cited a "tectonic shift" in the adoption of the company's AI software. The company's commercial revenues grew 71% year-over-year to $255 million, while government segment sales jumped 45% to $373 million. Karp attributed Palantir's government sector growth to greater U.S. defense sector adoption of its tools and noted that demand for large language models and supporting software has turned into a "stampede."</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%, following concerns that the stricter policy could cause financial hardship for beneficiaries. The agency had previously increased the clawback rate to 100% in March, directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency. Critics argue that even the 50% rate will still burden many disabled workers who rely on SSDI benefits. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations.</p>
