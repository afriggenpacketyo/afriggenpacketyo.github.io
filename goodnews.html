          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat to Argentina, exposing issues with team cohesion. Despite showing ambition and creating opportunities in attack, their execution was lacking, with offloads and passes frequently missing their mark. Two-time Lion Tadhg Beirne noted the world-class caliber of the players, but the team struggled to find a rhythm in their first 80 minutes together. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, citing compounded errors that prevented the team from dictating the game's pace, adding that the team will need to be sharper when they reach Australian shores.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's long-standing focus on countering Iran has gained traction following recent attacks, offering him a chance to reshape his legacy. Despite facing criticism for his handling of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack and ongoing domestic political challenges, a majority of Israelis support his decision to strike Iran. While some view the attacks as politically motivated, many believe Netanyahu genuinely aims to eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. However, critics argue that his actions are driven by a desire to consolidate power and distract from his legal troubles, but the first strike echoed Israel‚Äôs greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967.</p>

The proposal now heads to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports such bans, and would make Rhode Island the eleventh state with similar prohibitions. The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, and aims to prevent residents from purchasing them in other states. Critics argue that the ban will do little to curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Dua Lipa surprised fans at her first-ever Wembley Stadium show by bringing out Jamiroquai's Jay Kay for a performance of "Virtual Insanity." She called Kay "a massive trailblazer for British music" during the concert, which featured hits like "Physical," "One Kiss," and "Levitating." The show began with a new-agey wash of ocean sounds, that segued seamlessly into her 2024 single, Training Season. The Radical Optimism tour marks the first time Dua Lipa has headlined stadium dates, and she also spent time getting personal with fans in the front row.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., operator of Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo and plans to open three more to diversify its operations. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, viewing the beef bowl restaurant market as saturated, stating that ramen noodles allow the company to balance ingredient costs. This shift reflects a broader consumer trend towards more affordable food options.</p>
