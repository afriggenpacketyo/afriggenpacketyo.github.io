          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, surged to a record high, driven by positive economic news and trade optimism. The rally was fueled by the International Monetary Fund's decision to upgrade the country's 2025 growth forecast, citing the private sector's agility in managing supply chains. Additionally, comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary suggesting that trade negotiations with South Korea were nearing completion provided a significant boost to investor confidence. Major companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor saw substantial gains, reflecting the overall positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. Trump stated that this move is crucial for pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine, adding that the halt would involve "a little bit of a process." India is currently one of the largest buyers of Russian crude oil, a point of contention in its relationship with Washington. New Delhi has previously defended its purchases as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice in an effort to break out of a significant postseason slump. Ohtani, who has struggled at the plate with a low batting average and numerous strikeouts, is seeking to improve his performance in the National League Championship Series. He downplayed the idea that his dual role as a pitcher and hitter was directly contributing to his offensive struggles, stating that he feels physically fine. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that Ohtani's at-bats were already showing signs of improvement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from two major unions after the administration issued over 4,000 reduction-in-force notifications. The judge called the administration's actions "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts suggesting the firings were intended to punish political opponents by targeting specific agencies. The order provides temporary relief for thousands of workers who were facing termination amid the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>The British band The Last Dinner Party is exploring darker, more grandiose themes in their second album, titled "From The Pyre." Following the massive success of their debut, which won them a Brit Award for best newcomer, the group says they felt more confident and musically adventurous while writing the new record. Singer Abigail Morris reveals that some songs ruminate on personal loss and grief, drawing from the death of her father as a teenager. The band wrote much of the album over a short period at the beginning of the year, reflecting their rapid rise and demanding schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a plan to help the government close costly asylum hotels by moving asylum seekers into social housing. The proposal suggests the government provide funds to councils and housing associations to purchase more properties, which would be added to the nation's social housing stock. This would create new homes for existing tenants, and the vacated properties could then house asylum seekers at a fraction of the cost of hotels. The plan aims to provide a more sustainable and integrated solution while also increasing the overall availability of affordable housing.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is imperative and on its way, regardless of opposition from major tech companies. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, Blackburn noted that states like California and Texas have already begun implementing their own safeguards because Congress has not yet acted. She emphasized the need for a federal consumer privacy protection bill to give individuals control over their data before it is used to train AI models. Blackburn also highlighted growing concerns from parents about the impact of AI chatbots on children's mental health.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after an EF-5 tornado destroyed 95% of the town, Greensburg, Kansas, has reinvented itself as a model of resilience and sustainable energy. Following the 2007 disaster, the community made a conscious decision to rebuild using green technologies, and today, 100% of its electricity is generated by wind power. This focus on sustainability has provided long-term economic benefits, with the average cost of electricity remaining remarkably stable over the past decade. The town's successful renewal has inspired former residents to return, viewing it as an example of a rural community coming back stronger.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership is preparing to convene for the "Fourth Plenum," a critical planning meeting to establish the country's social and economic goals for the next five years. The meeting comes at a time of heightened tensions with the U.S. over technology and trade. Analysts expect Beijing to double down on its strategy of promoting domestic demand and increasing support for homegrown high-tech industries like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. The resulting "15th five-year plan" will be crucial for China's long-term ambition to achieve major breakthroughs in core technologies and boost its economic standing by 2035.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has officially entered the handheld gaming market with the release of the ROG Xbox Ally, a portable console designed to compete with devices like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck. The device runs on Windows, allowing it to play a vast library of PC games in addition to natively supporting the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. While the hardware is powerful enough to run most modern games and features a high-quality screen, its reliance on the Windows operating system can lead to occasional software hiccups and updates not typically seen on dedicated consoles.</p>
