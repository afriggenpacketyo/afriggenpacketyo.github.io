        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a six-month legal dispute, Republican Judge Jefferson Griffin conceded the North Carolina Supreme Court seat to Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Griffin's challenge, which included attempts to invalidate thousands of votes, ended after a federal court ruling ordered the state elections board to certify Riggs' victory. Riggs won by a margin of 734 votes out of over 5.5 million cast, a result affirmed by two recounts. The case drew criticism for potentially setting a precedent for future election challenges and undermining voter confidence. This New York Times article highlights the end of a contentious legal battle that tested the boundaries of post-election litigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bipartisan legislation in Congress is considering ending the production of pennies due to economic concerns, as it costs nearly four cents to produce each one-cent coin. Wake Forest University professor Robert Whaples argues that pennies are a waste of time and money, while collectors like the Kilcoyne family, who create custom collectible pennies, worry about the impact on their business. Shelly Gref, owner of Copper Penny Grille, has incorporated thousands of pennies into her bar tops and artwork, appreciating the historical significance of the coins. The fate of the penny remains uncertain as debates continue over its practical and sentimental value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the attempt by a Republican judge to overturn the reelection of a Democratic state Supreme Court Justice in North Carolina. The effort, which involved challenging thousands of ballots, was criticized for resembling the Bush v. Gore case and potentially violating the Constitution by applying non-uniform election rules after the election. A federal judge temporarily blocked the state from certifying the election results pending litigation. The legal challenge primarily targeted military and overseas voters who cast absentee ballots, arguing their ballots were invalid due to non-compliance with photo ID requirements.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used vehicle prices, increased to its highest level since October 2023, driven by consumer purchases amid fears of price increases due to auto tariffs. The index rose 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% from March, significantly exceeding the typical monthly increase. While tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, they affect new vehicle prices and demand, influencing the used car market. Retail used-vehicle sales in April were down 1.7% compared to March but up 13% year-over-year, with average listing prices exceeding $25,000.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential for President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that would be unprecedented and challenge the central bank's independence. Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates, which he believes would offset the impact of his tariffs. Powell has affirmed the Fed's independence, stating that officials are not removable except for cause. A Supreme Court case may alter the president's power over federal agencies, but it is unclear if it will apply to the Fed.</p>
