        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's chief negotiator is heading to the United States for another round of tariff negotiations, reiterating that the 25 percent additional auto tariffs imposed by Washington remain unacceptable. Ryosei Akazawa, minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, hopes to convince the United States to review the duty, especially as the 90-day pause on part of the reciprocal tariffs imposed on Japan and other countries expires on July 9. Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks climbed, with the Nikkei index ending at a five-month high, boosted by semiconductor-related shares amid hopes for robust demand for artificial intelligence. Japan is hoping to come to an agreement to avoid the tariffs. </p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has described the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites as a "historically successful attack," while criticizing media coverage as overly focused on discrediting President Trump. Hegseth condemned the leak of a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report that downplayed the damage, asserting that the Iranian program was "totally obliterated." CIA Director John Ratcliffe stated Iran's nuclear program has been "severely damaged" and any attempt to rebuild it would take years, while the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, confirmed the strikes went according to plan. Hegseth accused several news organizations of irresponsible reporting. </p>

          <p>A majority of CFOs surveyed by CNBC believe that significant changes will be made to President Trump's tax cut bill, but it will ultimately become law, with corporate tax breaks temporarily made law by Trump's 2017 tax act expected to remain in place. Despite concerns about the deficit, CFOs anticipate the corporate tax cuts will be extended, providing certainty for businesses amid expected economic headwinds from tariffs. The survey also revealed that CFOs expect bond yields to remain elevated, inflation to remain above the Fed's target, and a potential recession in the near future. The CFOs are remaining optimistic about the cuts. </p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inaugurated a new coastal tourist site during a ceremony, although the resort will initially be open only to domestic tourists. The Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone features hotels and accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests, offering activities such as swimming, sports, and dining. Experts believe North Korea invested heavily in the resort and will eventually need to welcome foreign tourists to recoup costs, with Russian tourists likely to be the first to visit. Kim is pushing to develop the country as a tourism hub to revive its struggling economy. </p>

During Act Two, Rachel Zegler, who plays Eva Per√≥n, emerges on a balcony and sings "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" to crowds gathered outside the theater. Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber secured permission to close the street for the performance, drawing comparisons to the real Per√≥n's appeal to the masses. While some ticket holders watch the scene on a screen inside the theater, many appreciate the added ambiance, and others plan to return to watch from the street. </p>

          <p>Experts recommend considering supplemental life insurance to augment basic workplace policies, especially as financial obligations evolve. Supplemental policies can be obtained through employers or purchased privately, with advantages and disadvantages to both options. Term life insurance is generally recommended for its affordability and substantial coverage during high-need years. Major life events, such as starting a family, should prompt a reevaluation of life insurance coverage to ensure adequate protection.

Nearly one-third of single-family offices plan to increase their allocations to private credit this year, while 30% intend to invest more in infrastructure. Liquidity is a key factor driving this shift, as the slowdown in exits means private equity investors have to wait longer for returns.

However, Anthropic still faces a separate trial in December over allegations that it downloaded millions of pirated books, with court documents revealing employee concerns about the legality of using pirate sites.

          <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. CD rates vary depending on the CD type, terms, and other details, with national averages for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CDs being 2.02%, 1.71%, and 1.72% APY, respectively. Online banks often offer the most competitive CD rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs can be a good way to get a top rate.

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently elevated, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.87% and the 15-year mortgage rate at 6.06%. Refinance rates are similar, with the average 30-year refinance rate at 6.86% and the 15-year refinance rate at 6.14%. Strengthening your credit profile is crucial for securing a good rate, and it's important to shop around and compare different lenders. Borrowers may soon see some relief if the Fed decides to pause rate hikes following its July rate increase. </p>

          <p>Savings accounts are a strong bet for storing an emergency fund, but the interest earned depends on current rates. The national average savings account interest rate is 0.38%, but high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates, with top rates between 4.11% and 4.30%. Online banks often offer the best high-yield savings accounts due to lower overhead costs, and many accounts have low or no minimums or monthly fees. Comparing different accounts is essential to find the product that maximizes savings potential. </p>
