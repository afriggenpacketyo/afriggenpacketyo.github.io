Since the operation began, authorities have made nearly 200 arrests, targeting offenses such as homicide, drug trafficking, and illegal firearm possession, as part of the effort to address crime in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Samsung's U.S. smartphone market share increased from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, signaling a renewed competition between the tech giants. This shift is partly attributed to Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which are gaining significant traction and offering a wider price range than Apple's current iPhone lineup. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to compete in this evolving market segment. (not investment advice)</p>

This call to action follows a government promise to establish an evacuation scheme, with an estimated few hundred children expected to be brought to the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support long-term heart health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. Since the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is crucial for maintaining its strength and overall cardiovascular wellness, a factor that becomes increasingly important with age.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is making a major comeback, confirming plans to reopen standalone stores on the UK High Street and hosting its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, the brand was bought by online retailer Asos but is now aiming to recapture its former glory and cultural relevance. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract its former millennial and Gen-Z customers, the brand faces significant challenges in appealing to new shoppers and competing in a vastly changed retail landscape.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week higher, setting several new record highs driven by speculation over the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. A cooler-than-expected July consumer price index report on Tuesday fueled investor optimism for a potential rate cut in September, pushing markets upward. Despite a subsequent report showing higher wholesale inflation, market odds for a rate cut remained strong, continuing the positive momentum for much of the week. (not investment advice)</p>

The project offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution, with Stark now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors using the same innovative method.</p>
