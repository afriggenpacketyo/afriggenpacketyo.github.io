          <p>A government panel of vaccine advisors is holding its first meeting since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed several vaccine critics to the group. Kennedy recently replaced all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), raising concerns about the future of vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. The new ACIP chair, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, stated that the panel aims to provide evidence-based recommendations on which vaccines are suitable for individuals and children. During the meeting, the panel will evaluate data on Covid-19 vaccines and RSV shots, with a vote on recommendations for the latter. </p>

          <p>An 18th-century shipwreck was discovered by chance near Dubrovnik's medieval city walls while a diver named Ivan Bukelic was working on a water pipeline. The vessel, found less than three feet under the seabed, is located in a UNESCO-protected heritage site known as a filming location for HBO's "Game of Thrones." Marine archaeologist Irena Radiƒá Rossi stated that radiocarbon analysis confirmed the boat's age and the goal is to continue researching it in cooperation with Croatia's Ministry of Culture, ensuring its protection for the future.

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill to ban Chinese artificial intelligence systems from federal agencies, aiming to ensure the U.S. maintains its lead in the global AI competition. The "No Adversarial AI Act" seeks to identify and prohibit AI systems developed by foreign adversaries from operating within the U.S. government, with exceptions for research and counter-terrorism purposes. Concerns have risen after a Chinese tech startup, DeekSeek, introduced an AI model rivaling those of OpenAI and Google, prompting calls for stronger export controls on advanced chips to China. Witnesses at a congressional hearing emphasized the importance of the U.S. prevailing in the AI race, highlighting that AI systems reflect the values of the societies that create them.</p>

Rieder believes the productivity gains from AI will offset any inflationary pressures from tariffs, which he views as a one-time adjustment for the U.S. economy. He also stated that the U.S. economy is unlikely to enter a recession due to its service-based nature, which is less cyclical than goods production.

          <p>NATO leaders have committed to increasing defense spending to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035, following pressure from President Donald Trump. The agreement, made at a summit in The Hague, is described by Trump as a "big win for Europe and... Western civilization." NATO members reaffirmed their commitment to the principle that an attack on one member would trigger a response from the entire alliance. The commitment to raise defense spending involves at least 3.5% of each member state's GDP on core defense expenditure by 2035, plus up to 1.5% on security infrastructure.</p>

          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first close-up images of ridges on Mars, offering compelling evidence of the planet's watery past. The images reveal a "boxwork pattern" of low ridges stretching across miles of a mountain, likely formed by groundwater trickling through rock and leaving behind minerals. These ridges, previously observed only from orbit, contain small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp. Scientists are intrigued by why the ridges hardened into these patterns and why they are localized in this area.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled that the California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, is violating state law with its smoke-damage policy, which has been criticized for undercompensating homeowners. The ruling states that the FAIR Plan's policy provides less coverage than required by the state's Standard Form Fire Insurance Policy, which covers all "loss by fire" damages without distinguishing smoke damage. The FAIR Plan's requirement that fire claims result in "direct physical loss" with "permanent physical changes" has made it difficult for homeowners to be compensated for smoke damage. The decision could have significant implications given the rapid growth of the FAIR Plan, which has seen enrollment skyrocket as insurers pull out of California's home insurance market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the concept of a credit card grace period, which is the time between the end of a billing cycle and the payment due date when no interest is charged on new purchases, provided the full statement balance is paid by the due date. The grace period allows cardholders to use credit cards without incurring interest charges, effectively providing a temporary, interest-free loan. However, carrying a balance from month to month typically results in the loss of the grace period on new purchases, causing interest to accrue immediately. To maximize the benefits of the grace period, the article advises paying the full statement balance by the due date each month, automating payments, tracking billing cycles, and avoiding cash advances.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for a second heatwave of 2025, with temperatures expected to soar above 30C this weekend and lasting into the first part of next week. The hot weather is likely to break the record for the hottest start to Wimbledon and approach the Glastonbury record. Heatwaves are becoming more frequent due to climate change, increasing the likelihood of extreme heat events. The hottest day of 2025 so far was recorded on June 21 at Charlwood, Surrey, reaching 33.2C (91.8F).</p>
