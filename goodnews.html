          <p>As astronomical autumn begins with the equinox on September 22, skygazers can look forward to several celestial events. Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth on September 21, making it easily visible to the naked eye, though a telescope is needed to see its rings. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22. Viewing conditions for the meteor shower are expected to be ideal due to the peak coinciding with a new moon.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns, all in their 80s, have defied church authorities by fleeing a care home and returning to their lifelong home at the Kloster Goldenstein convent. The nuns—Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita—stated they were moved against their will after their community was officially dissolved and the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to the convent, where they are now being supported by the community despite the church's disapproval, vowing to remain in their home.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Policy in Practice indicates that approximately seven million households in the UK are failing to claim £24 billion in available financial aid, including benefits and social tariffs. The research identifies awareness, complexity of the application process, and social stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from accessing this support. While the amount of unclaimed benefits is rising, the report also notes some progress, such as increased uptake of pension credit and better data usage by local authorities for free school meals. Experts advise people to apply for support, especially for "gateway benefits" that can unlock further assistance.</p>

Her landlord, 79-year-old Gil Pulliam, from whom she rents a studio for her makeup business, sensed her situation and offered to escort her. Fox joyfully accepted, and she described the moment he tightly held her hand during the processional as feeling "like a wound had been healed in my heart." The act of kindness created a new, meaningful father-figure relationship for Fox on her wedding day.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his role as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's new season. His debut program featured a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 3 with soloist Yunchan Lim, and Charles Ives’ Symphony No. 2. While the performance of the Ives symphony was noted for its exquisite lyricism, the review suggests Dudamel is still laying the groundwork with his new orchestra. The appointment has generated significant excitement, with hopes that Dudamel can reinvigorate the orchestra's prominence in the city's cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing shortage by overriding local zoning laws. The bill allows for the construction of taller, denser housing—up to nine stories—near major transit corridors like bus and train stations, including in single-family neighborhoods. Proponents, like author Sen. Scott Wiener, argue the measure is crucial for tackling the affordability crisis by building homes near public transportation. However, the bill faced opposition from critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, who argue it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local control over development.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies are bringing the science fiction concept of a universal translator closer to reality, spurred by advancements in generative AI. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, which can translate several languages into a user's headphones in real time. This move places Apple in direct competition with Google, which has a "Voice Translate" feature for its Pixel phones that preserves a speaker's voice inflections, and Meta, which is integrating translation into its smart glasses. This emerging tech battleground could reshape industries and fundamentally change cross-lingual communication.</p>

          <p>New documents have emerged in the mortgage fraud controversy surrounding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. A loan estimate for her Atlanta property, reviewed by Reuters, shows she declared it as a "vacation home," which appears to counter accusations from the Trump administration that she fraudulently claimed it as a primary residence. Officials had accused Cook of claiming two primary residences to gain favorable mortgage and tax terms, but this document suggests she was transparent with her lender. Cook has consistently denied wrongdoing and is currently suing the president to prevent her dismissal from the Federal Reserve.</p>
