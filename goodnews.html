          <h2>Chinese Researchers Announce Less Invasive Brain-Computer Interface Implanted Via Blood Vessel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has reported the successful completion of the world's first human trial for a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which involves inserting a stent electrode via a neck vein, helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The method is presented as a lower-risk alternative to open-skull surgeries, such as those performed by Elon Musk's Neuralink, potentially reducing surgical trauma and recovery time. The procedure was performed on a 67-year-old patient who had been paralyzed on one side following a stroke.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4 on Friday, securing sole possession of the best record in the MLB despite a performance their manager described as incomplete. Shohei Ohtani hit his 29th home run, and a two-run homer from Max Muncy contributed to the offense, but the team struggled overall with defensive errors and a quiet lineup late in the game. The victory came down to a game-ending double play in the ninth inning with the bases loaded. The win highlights the team's ability to grind out victories even when not playing at its peak.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has affirmed that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca stated that he sees the academy product as a potential top defender for the club and that the best plan is for him to remain with the team. Acheampong, who signed a new five-year contract last year, had a breakthrough season and will only be considered for a loan if it is deemed best for his development. The article also notes Enzo Fernandez's strong performance ahead of a match against his former club, Benfica.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have departed for China as their loan agreement expired. The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China next year. A farewell ceremony drew thousands of visitors to the park, which has been a key partner in a joint breeding program with China since 1994, successfully raising 17 cubs. The event marks a potential end to an era of panda diplomacy in the country.</p>

Her mixtape, "Alligator Bites Never Heal," received critical acclaim for its lyrical dexterity and honesty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan has found an association between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables among nearly 12,500 employees. The findings indicated that those who adhered to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, even after accounting for other potential factors. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in the diet, could play a role in supporting mental well-being.</p>

          <p>The British supermarket M&S has launched a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, taking inspiration from the Japanese "fruit sando" that has become a viral sensation. The sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, quickly became the chain's top-selling sandwich after its debut. While unusual to some in the UK, fruit sandwiches are a common snack in Japan, often sold in convenience stores and bakeries. The article explores the cultural context of the dessert-like sandwich and other unique sandwich varieties from around the world.</p>

Using a specific radar frequency that can penetrate clouds and foliage, the satellite can measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. This pioneering technology will allow scientists to create a global 3D map of forests, accurately estimate their role in mitigating climate change, and detect previously hidden illegal deforestation. The first images have already revealed new details about remote and inaccessible ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders targeting an elite law firm, ruling that the order against Susman Godfrey was unconstitutional. The decision marks another legal defeat for the administration's campaign to punish firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes. In her ruling, the judge called the order a violation of the Constitution and an attack on the American legal system. This follows three similar rulings where judges found the punitive orders, which suspend security clearances and bar access to government buildings, to be unconstitutional.</p>
