          <p>China held a large military parade featuring over 10,000 soldiers, aircraft, and weapons, watched by state leaders, foreign representatives, and 50,000 spectators. The parade highlighted China's growing military power and showcased the PLA's new structure after military reforms under Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping emphasized that the world is at a critical point and needs to make important choices. The display of military hardware and statecraft signals China's increasing global influence and its readiness to assert its interests on the world stage, as China seeks to solidify its role as a major player in international affairs.</p>

          <p>Veteran defense lawyer Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook against President Trump's attempt to unilaterally remove her, a move unprecedented in presidential history. Lowell, known for challenging federal agency overreach across administrations, argues that the allegations against Cook are unsubstantiated and irrelevant to her role at the Federal Reserve. He has a history of representing high-profile political clients, including Letitia James and Hunter Biden, often challenging presidential administrations' actions. Lowell's involvement underscores the escalating legal battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve and the limits of presidential power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 09:57:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet shares surged 8% after a judge ruled against the DOJ's proposal to break up Google in an antitrust case, which began in September 2023. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the court rejected the most severe remedies proposed by the DOJ, allowing Google to retain Chrome and continue its payment arrangements with companies like Apple to remain the default search engine. Analysts view this as a significant win for Google, removing a major overhang on the stock and reinforcing the durability of its search business. The ruling also allows Google to maintain control of the Android operating system, a key asset for expanding its AI initiatives.</p>

The company attributed the positive results to revamped stores and a resilient consumer, with CEO Tony Spring noting that Macy's is well-positioned to gain market share. Macy's is managing tariff impacts and focusing on growth in segments like denim and women's apparel. The department store chain also owns Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, which have consistently outperformed Macy's namesake stores.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief, Sir Mark Rowley, is advocating for a change in the law following the arrest of Graham Linehan over alleged online speech. Linehan was arrested for a post on X that was deemed a potential threat, prompting debate about free speech and police priorities. Sir Mark stated that the police are caught between a rock and a hard place when policing online speech and that the law needs clarification. In response, the Met will implement a more stringent triaging process to focus on the most serious cases involving a clear risk of harm or disorder.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping appeared with Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin at a military parade in Beijing, signaling solidarity against what they view as US-led imperialism. Analysts suggest this alliance is primarily for convenience, with North Korea seeking to diversify its relationships and reduce reliance on China. The Bank of Korea reported that North Korea's economy grew by 3.7% in 2024, fueled by cooperation with Russia. While united in their dislike for the US, each leader will likely exploit the three-way relationship for their own advantage, according to analysts.</p>
