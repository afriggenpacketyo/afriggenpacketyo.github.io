          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused widespread debris contamination. The study aims to determine the impact of excessive debris on sport fish populations by comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. Initial observations suggest conditions are within normal range, but scientists will analyze the data to confirm any long-term effects. Sport fishing is crucial to the area's tourism, and the cleanup efforts on Douglas Lake are nearing completion. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>Apple delivered solid quarterly numbers but a small miss on services revenue was disappointing and knocked the stock down in after-hours trading. While iPhone sales exceeded estimates, the services division's revenue of $26.65 billion fell short of the $26.7 billion expected. CEO Tim Cook pointed to a survey showing iPhones as the top-selling device in urban China, easing concerns about U.S.-China tensions impacting sales. He also stated that only $900 million in added costs are expected in the June quarter, assuming current tariff levels. (not investment advice) Optimism Score: 65</p>
