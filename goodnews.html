          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with net income rising 39.1% year-over-year and significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence processors from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strengthening AI "mega trend," the company raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure to at least $40 billion.

She completed the grueling race, which includes a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run, in 16 hours and 45 minutes. Remarkably, Grabow only learned to swim at age 59 specifically to compete in triathlons.

President Lee Jae Myung's administration asserts that the recent transition was a reaffirmation of the nation's robust democratic institutions, not a sign of fragility. The government also refutes claims of being anti-Christian, highlighting the integral role of Christianity in Korean society.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. states are vying for a share of a new $50 billion federal fund designed to transform rural healthcare, a program created to offset President Trump's deep cuts to Medicaid spending in these areas. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is encouraging states to propose innovative, technology-focused solutions rather than simply using the money to cover hospital operating budgets. This has created tension between traditional hospitals and newer health-tech companies, both competing for the funds. The program aims to reshape healthcare delivery in rural communities facing financial strain.</p>

          <p>During meetings with French and Spanish foreign ministers, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized that China and the European Union should position themselves as partners. Wang expressed hope that France would encourage the EU to practice "genuine strategic autonomy" and adopt a more positive perception of China. These diplomatic discussions are taking place amid ongoing mistrust over the war in Ukraine and significant trade frictions, including a massive EU trade deficit with China. The meetings aim to navigate these challenges and reinforce a cooperative relationship.</p>

          <p>The Bradford Bulls are set to return to the top tier of rugby league for the first time in 11 years, replacing the Salford Red Devils in the 2026 Super League. The promotion was determined by the sport's new grading system, which assesses clubs on various on- and off-field metrics, where Bradford achieved a higher Grade B status. This marks a significant comeback for the Bulls, a dominant force in the 2000s that later faced financial turmoil. Conversely, Salford's demotion follows a difficult season plagued by financial issues and a mass player exodus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying proteins that trigger programmed cell death, a process crucial for health but which goes awry in diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. Scientists at the Stowers Institute have focused on how these proteins form a "death fold" structure, causing a cell to self-destruct when it detects a threat. They believe this mechanism may be needlessly killing brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases. By understanding this process, researchers hope to develop treatments that can either prevent premature cell death in conditions like Alzheimer's or induce it in cancerous cells.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of making public bus services free is gaining traction in cities like New York, but transit advocates are split on whether it is the most effective strategy. Proponents argue that fare-free buses increase accessibility, speed up boarding times, and encourage more people to use public transit instead of cars. However, skeptics and some researchers suggest that riders prioritize service frequency and reliability over cost. Citing mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares due to funding issues, they contend that funds are better spent on improving service quality.</p>

          <p>As U.S. health insurance premiums continue to rise, a small but growing number of employers are opting to cover the full cost for their workers. Companies like Boston Consulting Group and the startup Bartesian are offering zero-premium health plans, meaning employees have no deductions from their paychecks for coverage. These businesses view the high cost as a worthwhile investment that aids in recruitment and retention, while also helping employees stay focused on their jobs. While this benefit is still rare, it presents an alternative approach to managing the escalating expense of healthcare in America.</p>

          <p>The world's largest luxury group, LVMH, has indicated that the slowdown in China's luxury market may be nearing its end, reporting its first quarterly sales growth of the year. The company noted that consumption in mainland China is approaching stabilization, with sales growing by mid to high-single digits in the third quarter. Analysts suggest this could be linked to an improving Chinese stock market and some pent-up demand. However, LVMH's CFO cautioned that a full recovery will still take time due to the country's ongoing property slump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two major unions, which argued the layoffs were an unlawful use of the funding lapse to downsize the government. The judge cited public statements from President Trump as evidence of political motivation for the cuts. The administration had already begun issuing notices to about 4,000 employees and had plans for over 10,000 total layoffs.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled an ambitious action plan to double its electric vehicle (EV) charging capacity by 2027, aiming to support the needs of over 80 million EVs. The plan, released by the National Development and Reform Commission, includes installing 1.6 million new fast chargers in urban areas and upgrading older facilities. This major nationwide expansion is designed to address issues like uneven network layout and insufficient services in residential areas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific research indicates that women may not only sleep differently than men but also have a biological need for more rest. Studies suggest women may require up to 20 additional minutes of sleep per night to support complex brain functions and manage hormonal cycles. Factors like the menstrual cycle can significantly impact sleep quality, with rising progesterone levels causing sleepiness but also more fragmented rest. Beyond biology, societal factors and the burden of domestic labor also contribute to women experiencing higher rates of sleep debt and insomnia symptoms.</p>

The law permits mentally sound adult citizens in the terminal stage of an irreversible disease to opt for a medically assisted death. The legislation, which had already passed the lower house, reflects Uruguay's history of socially liberal policies in a predominantly Catholic region. Public support for the measure is strong, with over 60% of Uruguayans in favor, continuing the nation's pioneering role on issues like cannabis legalization and same-sex marriage.</p>
