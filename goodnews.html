          <p>Thousands rallied in Tel Aviv, expressing gratitude to Donald Trump for his perceived role in facilitating a Gaza ceasefire and the anticipated release of Israeli hostages. US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowds, affirming that the hostages "are coming home." Concurrently, Palestinian officials noted that approximately 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza, now largely in ruins, following the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Egypt is set to host a summit to finalize a broader peace agreement, with Trump among the confirmed attendees. This article captures the complex mix of anticipation for hostage returns and the immense challenges of rebuilding and governance in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Kenya has officially converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans from US dollars to Chinese yuan, a strategic move expected to cut its annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. This decision, announced by Treasury Minister John Mbadi, is seen by analysts as a potential precedent for other debt-stressed African countries, possibly drawing them closer to China economically. The original loans from the Export-Import Bank of China financed the construction of the 600km Standard Gauge Railway. This article highlights a significant development in international finance, demonstrating a growing trend of de-dollarization and the increasing influence of the Chinese yuan in global trade and lending, particularly in Africa.

          <p>This opinion article posits that a "crisis of confidence" is currently undermining global climate action, despite unprecedented investment in clean energy, primarily due to rising populist pressures. Leaders are increasingly retracting environmental commitments, often framing climate policies as detrimental to affordability and energy security, which has led to significant cancellations of clean energy projects and associated job losses. The author contends that populist narratives exploit the visible immediate costs of climate action versus its abstract future benefits, systematically dismantling crucial policy frameworks. The article advocates for democracies to urgently establish more robust mechanisms to insulate climate policy from volatile political cycles and populist erosion. (not investment advice)</p>
