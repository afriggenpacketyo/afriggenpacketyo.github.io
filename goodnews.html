          <p>Robinhood's shares experienced a 2% drop after the online brokerage was not selected to join the S&P 500 during the index's latest quarterly rebalance. This news comes after speculation that Robinhood would earn a spot in the benchmark, with Bank of America even naming it as a top candidate. Despite this setback, Robinhood's shares have seen a significant comeback this year, increasing by 97% amid a rebound in both stocks and crypto. The company had previously fallen out of favor following the GameStop trading mania of 2021 and the collapse of FTX. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Silver is presented as a potentially cost-effective alternative to gold for investors looking for stability and security in the current economy. The price of silver is on the rise, with analysts predicting further increases, making it an opportune time to invest. While silver offers diversification and inflation hedging similar to gold, investors should limit their precious metal investments to avoid overcrowding other income-producing assets in their portfolio. Experts generally recommend capping precious metals at 10% of the overall portfolio, divided between gold and silver. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is splitting into two companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports and its broadcast rights. The split will create one company focused on streaming and studios and another on global television networks, including TNT Sports. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups, suggesting that TNT Sports could consciously uncouple from the streaming service. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the future CEO of Global Networks, will decide how to monetize TNT's future streaming and digital sports rights, including potential licensing deals or a merger with another entity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) plan to separate into two publicly traded companies by mid-2026 reflects a broader trend of corporate breakups and restructurings in the media industry. This move comes just over three years after the formation of WBD, highlighting the ongoing challenges media giants face in balancing legacy assets with the evolving streaming landscape. Other major media players, such as Viacom and News Corp., have followed similar paths of splitting and, in some cases, reuniting. WBD's breakup will create one company focused on streaming and studios and another on global television networks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and The New York Times. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's legal complaint alleging sexual harassment during the making of the movie *It Ends With Us*, which Baldoni directed and co-starred in. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to demonstrate actual malice in Lively's allegations or in the Times' reporting. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication, calling the lawsuit a sham.</p>

          <p>The transition to clean energy technologies, such as solar panels, batteries, and electric motors, is heavily reliant on critical minerals like lithium, copper, and cobalt. The demand for these minerals is expected to increase significantly by 2040, potentially leading to supply chain vulnerabilities. While the US is a major consumer of critical minerals, it is not a significant producer, prompting efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials and technologies to reduce the dependence on critical minerals, but these efforts will take time and investment.</p>
