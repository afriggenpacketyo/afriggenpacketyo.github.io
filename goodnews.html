        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant setback to his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties. The ruling specifically addresses tariffs related to drug trafficking with Canada, Mexico, and China, deeming them invalid as they do not address the threats outlined in the orders. The court has ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs, but the Trump administration has swiftly appealed the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid intensified immigration enforcement in the United States, the Latino community is increasingly seeking naturalization. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, with 818,500 new citizens in fiscal year 2024. Community organizations and legal offices note a surge in applications since the Trump administration expanded immigration operations. This push for citizenship is seen not only as a protection against deportation but also as an opportunity to increase Latino participation in upcoming congressional elections, aiming to counter current political trends.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever experienced their worst loss of the season against the Washington Mystics, with a final score of 83-77, in the first game Caitlin Clark missed due to a quad injury. The Fever initially led but were outscored by the Mystics for much of the game. The team's lowest score of the season highlights Clark's importance to the team. Clark is expected to miss at least two weeks, having averaged 19.0 points, 9.3 assists, and 6.0 rebounds in her first four games.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company anticipates $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, though this figure is reduced due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry. Despite these challenges, Nvidia continues to experience strong demand for its artificial intelligence chips, with net income increasing 26% to $18.8 billion.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies as "fantasy" economics, likening Farage to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Reform's proposed tax cuts would lead to an economic meltdown and increase mortgage costs. Reform UK has gained traction in recent local elections, challenging the traditional main parties. A Reform spokesperson dismissed Starmer's comments as a "desperate attack" from a party trailing in the polls.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man to the U.S. after a federal judge ordered officials to "facilitate" his return. The man, known by the initials O.C.G., had been deported despite claiming he had experienced violence in Mexico and was afraid to go back. The agreement represents a substantial de-escalation in a case shaping up to be a key courtroom battle over Trump's deportation attempts.
