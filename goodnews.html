          <p>CBS News has launched a new local station in Atlanta, distinguishing itself with an immersive, tech-forward newsroom instead of traditional news desks. In just five weeks, the station hired a staff of 50, attracting talent from across the country with its entrepreneurial "startup" energy backed by a major news organization. Anchors and reporters expressed excitement about the community-focused mission and the opportunity to build a new journalistic venture from the ground up. The station will begin with evening newscasts, with plans to expand to a morning show in the future.</p>

          <p>British actor Stephen Graham won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor for his role in the Netflix drama "Adolescence." In a heartfelt acceptance speech, Graham described himself as "just a mixed-race kid from Kirkby," stating that achievements like this don't typically happen to someone with his background. He paid tribute to his family, particularly his wife Hannah Walters, whom he called his "rock" and "soulmate." The actor, known for his roles in "This Is England" and other acclaimed productions, emphasized that his journey shows that "any dream is possible."</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that a "framework" deal has been reached with China regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. The agreement, forged during trade talks in Madrid, is intended to pave the way for American ownership of the popular social media app. The final details are expected to be completed by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. This development comes as a September 17 deadline looms for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a nationwide ban due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following in the footsteps of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, partly driven by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties. Despite facing increased competition from AI challengers and regulatory scrutiny, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. The milestone marks a significant moment for the tech giant, which went public as Google just over 20 years ago. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Finds Renewable Energy Sources Remain Most Cost-Effective</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis, using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, has determined that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. Even without government subsidies, these renewables are more cost-competitive than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operational costs are significantly lower because the "fuel" (wind and sun) is free. The analysis also considers the impact of government policies, such as the Trump administration's tariffs and tax incentives, on overall energy production costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Advice Ahead of Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, this article provides four key financial moves for consumers to consider. Experts advise prioritizing the paydown of high-interest debt, as a small rate cut will not significantly lower the cost of carrying balances on credit cards. Savers are encouraged to lock in high yields on CDs and high-yield savings accounts before rates drop. The lower interest rate environment could also present a favorable opportunity for prospective homebuyers, while improving one's credit score remains a crucial step to qualify for the best loan terms available.

          <h2>U.S. Banks Borrow $1.5 Billion from Federal Reserve's Repo Facility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:49:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Monday, U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF), a move indicating some minor tightness in short-term funding markets. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large settlement of Treasury securities, which increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding squeezes by allowing banks to exchange eligible collateral, like Treasuries, for overnight cash. Analysts suggest the liquidity pressure is likely temporary and not a sign of a broader funding crisis. (not investment advice)</p>
