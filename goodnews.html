The rise in demand is attributed to an increase in available housing inventory, enticing potential buyers despite economic uncertainty.

          <p>A resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to set the stage for further agreements linking minerals and geopolitics. The deal aims to deepen economic ties and position Ukraine as a supplier of strategically important minerals to the U.S. Experts suggest that Washington's rivalry with Beijing, the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, has put critical minerals at the center of the U.S. national security agenda. While some analysts are skeptical about a wave of bilateral agreements, others believe resource nationalism is on the rise.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, in an effort to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves fully covering expenses for normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system. The government currently provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen ($3,400) for each childbirth, but delivery costs often exceed that amount. Obstetricians have raised concerns that the move could cause financial strain for medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary, criticized the Trump administration at a town hall in Iowa, prompting speculation about his 2028 presidential ambitions. Without mentioning Trump by name, Buttigieg assailed the president's efforts to cut the Department of Veterans Affairs and his broader handling of the country. He urged attendees to exert pressure on their representatives to block cuts to federal agencies and tax breaks for the wealthy. Buttigieg said that any decision about running in 2028 was ‚Äúa long way off,‚Äù but he would ‚Äúassess‚Äù what he brought to the table.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility has caused concern for college savers, with some families seeing a decline in the value of their 529 college savings plans. Experts advise checking asset allocation and assessing risk appetite, particularly in age-based portfolios. While it's important to avoid panic selling, shifting a portion of the portfolio into cash equivalents can provide protection and peace of mind. Those needing to make withdrawals for tuition payments should consider using other savings and reimbursing themselves later, allowing time for market recovery. (not investment advice)</p>
