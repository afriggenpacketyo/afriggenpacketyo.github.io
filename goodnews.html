          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to approve COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new top vaccines official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, stated that the agency is seeking a balance between providing rapid access for vulnerable people and ensuring evidence for those at average or low risk. Vaccine makers are urged to conduct new randomized studies, with interim results potentially available next year.</p>

          <p>Japan is reportedly considering easing its demand for a full removal of U.S. tariffs, potentially accepting lower duty rates to reach a trade agreement with the United States. This shift comes as President Donald Trump shows reluctance to fully address Japan's initial demands. Top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is scheduled to visit the United States for a third round of bilateral talks. This adjustment reflects the challenges Japan faces in navigating trade negotiations amidst ongoing trade tensions and the need to secure favorable economic terms with the U.S.</p>

          <p>NFL owners are considering a proposal to ban the "Tush Push" play, a controversial short-yardage tactic popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Packers' proposal cites "player safety" and "pace of play" as reasons for the ban. While some coaches express safety concerns, NFL executive Jeff Miller argues that data does not support safety being an issue with the push. Jason Kelce, an Eagles player, has described the play as "grueling" but does not consider it particularly dangerous, while others like Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu call it a "cheapo play."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has decided not to finalize a rule that would have allowed Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss, leaving millions without access to these medications. Despite this, some states like South Carolina are independently covering GLP-1s for Medicaid beneficiaries, albeit with stringent prerequisites. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed interest in future coverage as costs decrease, the decision highlights the ongoing debate over the affordability and accessibility of obesity treatments. Public health experts acknowledge the need for more comprehensive strategies to address obesity, including surgical intervention and GLP-1s.</p>

This initiative aims to reverse the soaring infection rates and combat the increasing difficulty in treating gonorrhoea due to antibiotic resistance.

          <p>The global economy has responded positively to a US-China tariff truce, signaling a potential step back from a damaging trade decoupling. While the truce is currently a 90-day reprieve, it indicates that neither side is willing to completely sever economic ties. Despite remaining tariffs still casting a shadow over bilateral trade, most business leaders expect tariffs on Chinese goods to either hold steady or decrease further after the 90-day period lapses. The truce also raises hope for resolutions on other contentious issues, such as fentanyl.</p>
