          <p>English golfer Lottie Woad achieved a remarkable victory at the Women's Scottish Open, winning the tournament on her professional debut. The 21-year-old former world number one amateur maintained her composure throughout the final round, finishing at 21 under par, three shots clear of her nearest competitor. This win comes just after she narrowly missed out on a large prize at the Evian Championship as an amateur. Woad's performance secures her £220,000 in prize money and positions her as a strong contender for the upcoming Women's Open.</p>

          <p>According to sources, the United States and China are expected to agree to another 90-day extension of their tariff truce during trade talks in Stockholm. The current suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. While the extension signals a commitment to avoid escalating the trade war, insiders do not anticipate major breakthroughs on contentious issues like China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. on its tariffs related to fentanyl, seeking clarity on what would be required to ease them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A one-year-old boy in the Indian state of Bihar reportedly killed a cobra by biting it after the snake had coiled around his hands. The infant, named Govinda, was playing at home when the incident occurred; he fainted shortly after but was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Doctors confirmed the boy's condition is stable, stating that the venom's effects were mild and that timely medical intervention saved his life. The incident highlights the prevalent danger of venomous snakes in India, which is home to the "big four" species responsible for the majority of fatal snakebites in the country.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are continuing their bipartisan effort to force a House vote on the full release of files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. After the House Speaker recessed early, avoiding a vote on their joint legislation, the congressmen are now seeking a discharge petition to bypass leadership. Massie stated they want more than just specific documents, calling for the financial records of Epstein's estate and details of his controversial plea deal. The move aims to bring legal force to the release of documents, with protections for victims' identities.</p>

          <h2>Financial Columnist Analyzes Proposed "Trump IRA" for Children</h2>

          <p>A financial columnist examines the newly established "Trump IRA," a savings account designed to help young people save, where parents and employers can contribute up to $5,000 annually for children under 18. While noting the appeal of a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born in a specific timeframe, the author argues there are better long-term savings strategies. The article suggests that 529 education accounts, custodial Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies offer more significant and flexible benefits for a child's future. The "Trump IRA" is framed as a minor political giveaway rather than a robust financial planning tool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas draws on deep personal tragedy for her directorial debut, "My Mother's Wedding," a film about three daughters grappling with loss as their mother prepares to remarry. Thomas reveals that the story is rooted in the pain of her own childhood, having lost her father, a Royal Navy pilot, at age five, and her stepfather five years later in a similar accident. The Oscar-nominated star, known for roles in "The English Patient" and "Slow Horses," co-wrote the screenplay, transforming her feelings of an incomplete past into a creative work starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek show that the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just extra time off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that workers feel significantly more effective and productive while on the clock. Faced with a compressed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes and eliminate busywork, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control. This feeling of being good at their jobs positively impacts overall well-being and strengthens team spirit, suggesting a powerful psychological benefit beyond improved work-life balance.</p>

          <p>UK charities are warning that almost £275 million in government-allocated Child Trust Funds (CTFs) intended for young people from low-income backgrounds are currently unclaimed. These tax-free savings accounts were set up for children born between 2002 and 2011, with the government providing an initial deposit. The Share Foundation, a charity that helps locate these funds, reports that over £400 million in total is sitting dormant and is calling for an automatic release mechanism. They argue this would provide an immediate financial injection for young adults at no new cost to the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround one year into the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg. The company's aircraft production and delivery numbers have improved, and it is expected to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year, boosting investor confidence. Ortberg has been credited with changing the company culture and being more present at production facilities, earning praise from airline customers. However, Boeing still faces significant challenges, including an FAA-imposed production cap on the 737 MAX and persistent delays in certifying new aircraft models. (not investment advice)</p>
