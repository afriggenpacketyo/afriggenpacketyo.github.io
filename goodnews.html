          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility, over three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. He and his wife, Yvette, were attacked in what authorities have described as part of a series of "politically motivated" shootings targeting lawmakers. The alleged assailant, who also fatally shot another state representative and her husband on the same night, is now facing multiple murder and attempted murder charges. Hoffman's release from the ICU marks a significant step in his recovery from the violent assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new gene therapy, administered through a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks. The research, detailed in Nature Medicine, involved delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene directly to the inner ear of patients whose hearing loss was caused by a mutation. All ten participants, including children and adults, showed considerable improvement, with one seven-year-old girl recovering almost full hearing. This pioneering treatment is being hailed as a major and safe breakthrough with potential to treat other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian aggression. This decision comes just days after the White House confirmed a temporary pause on some weapon shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The President emphasized the need for Ukraine to be able to protect itself amid the ongoing conflict, which he noted is causing many deaths. The move follows recent calls between Trump and the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine, with the Ukrainian president describing his conversation as fruitful.</p>

          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly popular destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Factors such as cultural similarities, perceived safety, and a welcoming environment are drawing students who might have previously prioritized American universities. This trend reflects broader shifts in global education, with Chinese nationals reconsidering their long-term prospects in the U.S. due to cultural adjustment challenges and safety concerns. As a result, Singapore's top universities are anticipating a rise in applications from China, solidifying the city-state's status as a major educational hub.</p>

          <h2>TSA Begins Phasing Out Shoe Removal Requirement at Some U.S. Airports</h2>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its long-standing policy that required passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes for screening. The change, which began rolling out at several U.S. airports, marks a major shift from the security protocol implemented nationwide in 2006. This policy was originally established following the 2001 "shoe bomber" incident. While travelers in the PreCheck program were already exempt, this new rule aims to streamline the security process for all passengers, though those who trigger alarms may still be required to remove their footwear for additional checks.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has increased its return forecasts for the S&P 500 index, signaling a more optimistic outlook for the U.S. stock market. The investment bank now projects the index will reach 6,600 by the end of the year and 6,900 within 12 months, up from previous estimates. This revision is based on expectations of earlier and more significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, along with the continued strong performance of major large-cap stocks. Analysts also noted that the impact of recent tariffs on corporate earnings appears to be less severe than initially anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently restrict a landlord's ability to evict tenants for the purpose of substantial renovations, a practice known as "renoviction." The new amendment will require landlords to obtain a government agency order, typically issued for safety code violations, before they can legally evict for a remodel. This measure aims to close a loophole that tenant advocates say was used to displace long-term renters in order to charge higher rents to new tenants. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and compensated during legitimate, necessary renovations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to revitalize its tourism sector and strengthen international ties, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa.

The policy aims to remove the hassle and cost of the visa application process, making China a more accessible destination for global travelers.

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will sever ties with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partners misled students about a cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit claimed the program was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name but had minimal connection to the university's faculty or standards. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to new transparency rules and will provide tuition refunds to hundreds of students. The decision represents a significant development in the scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online program managers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to implement a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs in August. The VA stated that a department-wide review, along with staff reductions through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, have made the mass layoffs unnecessary. The agency is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through these other means. The initial plan had drawn criticism from some lawmakers who worried about the potential impact on services for veterans.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. The review also found no evidence of a "client list" or credible proof that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals, debunking widespread conspiracy theories. Investigators confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death. The memo detailing the findings stated that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the cause of justice for them.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner in recognition of his storied career. The selection came as a complete surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. While acknowledging he didn't "deserve" the honor based on his 2025 performance, Kershaw expressed gratitude for the recognition. The pick allows one of the game's most accomplished pitchers to participate in the Midsummer Classic, an event he may not have otherwise qualified for this year.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of such aircraft to modern air defenses and drones in the war in Ukraine. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in future-warfare capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. This move reflects a growing reevaluation among global militaries regarding the survivability and cost-effectiveness of traditional attack helicopters in an increasingly complex and lethal battlespace.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not press charges against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event being officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. This decision comes as a relief to participants who feared fines and organizers who faced potential prison time under Hungary's controversial anti-LGBTQ+ laws. The parade attracted a record crowd in defiance of the government's stance.</p>
