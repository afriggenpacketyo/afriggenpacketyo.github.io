          <p>A spokeswoman has confirmed that former President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery to address skin cancer. This procedure involves removing thin layers of skin until no cancerous tissue remains, a technique considered highly effective for common skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma. This follows a previous procedure in 2023 where a cancerous lesion was removed from his chest, and is separate from his earlier diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie has been discovered among his personal archives, which are being donated to the V&A Museum. The project was an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," for which Bowie had compiled extensive notes on London society, crime, and satire from that era. These notes, found locked in his private study after his death, reveal his ambition to write for the theatre and offer new insights into his creative process during his final months.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after his murder conviction was vacated, freeing him after 27 years of wrongful imprisonment. His 1998 conviction was based largely on the testimony of a woman who has since confessed to the crime herself. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release after a review of the case, acknowledging that the conviction was tainted by false evidence and that jailhouse informants had also recanted their testimony years ago.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Exeter suggests that drinking beet juice may help lower blood pressure, particularly in older adults, by positively altering the oral microbiome. The research found that nitrates in the juice increased beneficial bacteria and reduced harmful bacteria in the mouth, which was associated with a clinically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. While beets are a rich source, other nitrate-heavy foods like spinach, kale, and celery may offer similar cardiovascular benefits as part of a balanced diet.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, has raised concerns about the enterprise adoption of agentic AI browsers, which can autonomously perform tasks for users. He argued that unless these browsers have robust security controls for managing credentials, companies will be hesitant to allow them due to the risks associated with AI agents having autonomy. This warning comes as his company plans a major acquisition of identity security provider CyberArk, highlighting the growing importance of protecting corporate data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new ordinance that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees. The proposal follows a similar law recently enacted for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address the growing public health risks of extreme heat. Proponents argue it is a critical health measure, especially for vulnerable populations, while landlord associations have raised concerns about the potential costs for building upgrades and higher utility bills for tenants.</p>
