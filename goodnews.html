          <h2>Novo Nordisk Shares Rise as Drugmaker Predicts Wegovy Sales Rebound in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 04:45:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a surge following the company's announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025. This positive outlook is driven by the anticipated phasing out of copycat compounded drugs that had previously impacted Wegovy's market share in the U.S. The Danish pharmaceutical company reported first-quarter net profit that exceeded expectations, with CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen attributing the future sales growth to the FDA's drug shortage ruling, which will effectively eliminate compounding alternatives. While the company trimmed its full-year sales growth forecast, the overall sentiment remains optimistic regarding Wegovy's performance in the coming year.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have introduced a series of measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), to stimulate economic growth amid trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and the RRR, injecting significant liquidity into the market. These policies aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, alongside initiatives to boost consumption and elderly care. While some analysts express concerns about the limited impact on domestic credit demand, the move signals a proactive approach by Chinese officials to address economic challenges and ease depreciation pressure on the yuan.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have shown resilience despite escalating tensions with Pakistan following India's military operation within Pakistani-controlled territory. Investors are maintaining their focus on India's strong growth prospects and macroeconomic fundamentals, overshadowing geopolitical concerns. Analysts suggest that structural reforms, robust domestic demand, and progress in trade talks with major partners, such as the UK and potentially the U.S., are bolstering market confidence. The article references historical precedents, such as the market's reaction to the 2019 Pulwama attack, to support the view that Indian assets will likely remain stable despite the increase in geopolitical tensions.
