          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. He stated that the increase from 25% would further secure the steel industry, making it harder for foreign producers to circumvent the tariffs. Trump also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, describing it as a partnership that would keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh while Nippon invests $14 billion. The president assured that the deal would be controlled by the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a federal court struck down President Trump's use of emergency powers to enact broad tariffs, his administration is exploring alternative trade policy options. While the tariffs remain in place temporarily, the ruling puts much of Trump's trade agenda at risk. Other options include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. These alternative pathways have limitations compared to the broader authority of the IEEPA. (not investment advice)</p>

The report indicates that President Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Americans are cooling off on spending and incomes rose due to an increase in Social Security benefits. The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries.
