          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under an import tax exemption more than doubled last year, reaching £3 billion, driven largely by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This surge, accounting for 51% of all low-value imports, has prompted the UK government to review the existing rules. UK business owners express concern about being undercut by these cheap goods and consumers potentially receiving faulty products. Retail analysts warn that while the exemption needs addressing, any changes must avoid harming lower-income consumers or small firms reliant on such imports (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>During an expedition to the Liliʻuokalani ridge north of Hawaii, researchers aboard the exploration vessel Nautilus discovered a unique geological formation resembling a "yellow brick road" on a dried-up lake bed. Located over 3,000 meters below the surface within the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, this volcanic rock fractured in 90-degree angles due to heating and cooling stress, creating the striking appearance. The discovery, made in one of the world's largest yet least explored marine conservation areas, offers scientists new insights into Earth's hidden geology and the potential for further exploration.</p>

          <p>Greater Change, a charity, is providing direct cash grants to individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness, claiming that 86% of recipients transition into stable housing. The initiative, funded by donations and grants, allows people to spend money on essential needs like rent deposits or bills, restoring "dignity of choice." International and smaller UK projects support the idea that direct aid does not increase spending on addictions. While acknowledging the scheme is most effective as an early intervention and doesn't address systemic housing shortages, the charity highlights its potential to save taxpayer money by preventing entrenched homelessness.</p>

          <p>Celebrated author Jacqueline Wilson describes her new adult novel, "Picture Imperfect," a sequel to "The Illustrated Mum," as both the easiest and hardest book she has ever written. The sequel revisits Dolphin, now 33, still caring for her unstable, bipolar mother Marigold, and navigating her own unfulfilled life. Wilson aimed for a realistic portrayal of messy families and mental illness, themes central to her work, acknowledging the emotional connection readers have to her characters. She emphasizes her commitment to honesty in her writing, balancing difficult realities with the need to avoid overwhelming younger readers in her children's books.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle industry is rapidly reshaping the global car market, with BYD surpassing Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024 and China becoming the largest vehicle exporter. This surge is attributed to substantial government subsidies, tax incentives, lower labor costs, and technological innovation. Western markets, including the US and EU, are responding with duties amid concerns of anti-competitive practices. Analysts predict China will produce four out of ten global cars by 2030, intensifying pressure on international manufacturers and prompting a potential industry shake-out (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of WWII, China is asserting its role as a defender of the post-war international order, despite being increasingly characterized as a revisionist power. The article highlights China's immense sacrifices as a key Allied power, with an estimated 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians dying in the Sino-Japanese war. Beijing's determination to uphold global norms is underpinned by this history. This stance contrasts with Western narratives that frame China's growing influence as a challenge to the existing global system.</p>
