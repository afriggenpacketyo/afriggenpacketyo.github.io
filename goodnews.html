          <p>Jake Larson, the beloved World War II veteran known to 1.2 million TikTok followers as "Papa Jake," has died peacefully at the age of 102. His granddaughter confirmed his passing, noting he maintained his humor until the end. Larson captivated audiences by blending humorous anecdotes with somber reflections on the horrors of war, often calling himself "the luckiest man in the world" for surviving D-Day. A recipient of the Bronze Star and French Legion of Honour, he recently co-won an Emmy for his D-Day anniversary interview, leaving behind a legacy of honoring those who served.</p>

          <p>A national inquiry will be held into the 1984 Battle of Orgreave, one of the most violent confrontations during the year-long miners' strike in Britain. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the inquiry, stating it aims to address "unanswered questions for over 40 years" regarding the clash between police and striking miners. Chaired by the Bishop of Sheffield, the inquiry will investigate the day's events, the aftermath, and the collapse of criminal prosecutions against 95 miners due to allegations of falsified evidence. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for 13 years, expressed cautious elation, hoping for truth and justice for affected mining communities.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Bond ETFs Soar Past $50 Billion Amidst Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 02:23:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track bonds, driving assets under management to over $50 billion by the end of June, a significant rise from $10 billion early last year. This surge is fueled by investors seeking lower costs, diversified exposure, and hedging against China's uncertain economic outlook, including persistent deflation and trade frictions. Bond ETFs offer better liquidity and lower default risks compared to direct corporate debt, with some even usable as collateral. While the central bank warns against excessive bond rallies, these ETFs provide access to higher-yielding corporate notes, attracting private funds and brokerages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is hosting executives from leading German firms, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage fresh investment and restore economic confidence after two years of recession. This "Made for Germany" initiative aims to stimulate growth, with participating companies expected to present new projects and commit capital. While the government has approved significant tax relief and a €500-billion fund for infrastructure and climate, Berlin emphasizes the necessity of private sector participation. The meeting highlights efforts to revive Germany's economy, which has been impacted by inflation, energy price shocks, and global competition.</p>

For years, inadequate railway infrastructure had hindered these countries' iron ore export capabilities. In Guinea, the Simandou project, a joint development with Rio Tinto, is now on schedule to commence iron ore shipments by November. Similarly, in Algeria, new and upgraded railway lines will bridge the 1,650km distance from the Gara Djebilet mine to Mediterranean ports, overcoming significant logistical bottlenecks and opening new trade avenues.</p>
