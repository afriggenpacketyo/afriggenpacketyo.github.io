          <p>Columbia University will pay $200 million to the federal government and an additional $21 million to the EEOC to resolve investigations into on-campus anti-discrimination law violations. The deal, which Columbia does not admit wrongdoing in, will restore hundreds of millions in federal research grants that the Trump administration had withheld over allegations of antisemitism. As part of the agreement, the university has codified several policy changes, including a ban on masks intended to conceal identity and the hiring of special safety officers. The settlement aims to end a period of federal scrutiny and restore the university's research partnership with the government.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, known as Janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach for the first time in a decade by a Scripps Institute of Oceanography researcher. These pelagic snails, which float on the ocean surface using a bubble raft, are typically found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance coincides with unusually warm offshore water temperatures, prompting speculation about a potential link to climate change. Researchers are encouraging the public to report any further sightings to help track the species' movement and understand the effects of changing ocean conditions.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to pay the Trump administration $200 million to settle accusations that it failed to adequately protect its Jewish students from antisemitism. In exchange for the payment and policy changes, the federal government will reinstate $400 million in frozen research grants, a crucial source of funding for the institution. The agreement is presented by the administration as a model for other universities facing similar scrutiny over campus protests and diversity policies. This contrasts with Harvard University, which is currently suing the administration over its own funding cuts.</p>

          <p>South Korean manufacturer SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to strong global demand and favorable pricing for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies. As a key supplier to companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix has solidified its leadership in the advanced memory market, even surpassing rival Samsung in some areas. The company anticipates continued growth, planning to double its HBM sales for the year and increase capital expenditure in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five men from Las Vegas have been sentenced for their involvement in 'Jetflicks,' a massive illegal streaming service that offered over 183,000 pirated television episodes. The operation, which generated millions in illicit profits, is considered the largest internet piracy case ever brought to trial by the U.S. Department of Justice. The defendants used automated software to acquire and distribute copyrighted content, often making it available to tens of thousands of subscribers within a day of its original airing. The sentences range from time served to seven years in federal prison, marking a significant outcome in the fight against digital piracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The panel of judges found the order 'invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship' to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration argued the 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, but the court rejected this interpretation as unmoored from historical legal principles. While the White House plans to appeal, this decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the origins of the band Black Sabbath and how they invented the genre of heavy metal, following the recent death of singer Ozzy Osbourne at age 76. The band, formed by working-class musicians from Birmingham, reacted against the 'hippy' music of the late 1960s by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, was central to their sound, featuring detuned, powerful riffs that became a genre template. Despite initial critical dismissal and controversy, the band's influential albums defined a new musical movement.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants player Rafael Devers made his debut at first base and expressed a surprising preference for playing a defensive position. This comes after his time with the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about serving exclusively as a designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat, a significant shift from his previous stance. The change follows a tense spring training where he and his former manager appeared at odds over his role, which ultimately led to him becoming a full-time DH in Boston.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the first, beating expectations and allowing the nation to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts remain cautious, suggesting the export-driven pace may not be sustainable if global trade softens. The country's full-year GDP growth is still forecast to be at its slowest pace since 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see a 19 percent tariff on imports from those nations while U.S. shipments will face no duties. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to counter China's influence by reshaping regional supply chains and gaining access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. However, the article notes that the strategy's effectiveness may be limited, as Chinese companies are increasingly localizing their production within Southeast Asia. This makes them less reliant on the transshipment routes that such trade deals might otherwise disrupt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While still considered a seller's market, the U.S. housing market is beginning to show a slight shift that could benefit homebuyers, according to real estate experts. A key factor is rising inventory, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, the highest rate since 2013. However, median home prices hit a record high in June, partly because many current homeowners with low-interest mortgages are reluctant to sell. Experts advise prospective buyers to look for homes that have been on the market longer or to seek out properties that need updates in good neighborhoods. (not investment advice)</p>

The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere, a process that drives phenomena like the aurora but also poses risks to technology.
