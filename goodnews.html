          <p>This article recounts the story of Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, who were childhood friends before the tragic murder of the Pelley family in 1989. Jessica, who survived the murders, was sent to live with relatives and lost contact with Stephanie. For 20 years, Stephanie grieved the loss of her friend and the Pelley family, regularly visiting their graves. The two women eventually reunited through Facebook in 2009 and rediscovered their bond, now considering each other sisters, solving the mystery of missing flowers from the cemetery during Jeff Pelley's trial, as Jessi was the one who took them home as keepsakes.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has returned to New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE custody. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days due to his role in campus protests against Israel. The Trump administration sought his deportation, alleging his activities aligned with Hamas, though he was not charged with any crimes. U.S. District Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled Khalil was not a threat and that the government's actions were an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The policy change would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs, potentially stripping them of millions of dollars in funding. Judge Indira Talwani ruled the change was arbitrary and capricious, threatening critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually.</p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House and a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, with Mr. Trump taking credit on his Truth Social platform. The release signals a potential warming of ties between Washington and Belarus-ally Moscow. Tikhanovsky had been imprisoned for over five years and was a popular Youtuber who planned to run against Lukashenko in the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The bill, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges for potentially violating the separation of church and state. The law requires schools to post a 16x20 inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents say it infringes on religious freedom.</p>

Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice describe the pressure and verbal abuse they endure while trying to assist patients. The Labour government has pledged to address this issue with increased funding and online appointment systems. The practice has expanded its team of health professionals to include nurses and pharmacists, allowing doctors to focus on more complex cases, and is slowly gaining traction among the patient base.</p>
