          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of the posts he made about US President Donald Trump during a recent social media exchange. This comes after Trump declared that their relationship was over and that he had no interest in mending ties with Musk. Musk had previously called Trump's tax bill a "disgusting abomination," leading to a public fallout between the two figures. Musk took to his platform X to express his remorse, saying that some of his posts about President Donald Trump went too far.</p>

          <p>Proxima Fusion, a German start-up, has raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a Series A funding round to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Investors are hopeful the company can soon achieve this goal. The financing round represents the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. Advocates say the technology can play a pivotal role in the energy transition by providing virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy. Researchers suggest the technology is likely still a long way off from being ready to be scaled up for commercial use.</p>

          <p>Asia is progressively moving away from the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging. ASEAN has committed to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment to reduce shocks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. The world has also been cutting its reliance on the greenback, with the share of the dollar in global foreign exchange reserves declining from over 70% in 2000 to 57.8% in 2024. Countries are looking at the fact that the dollar has been, and can be used as a sort of weapon on trade and sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

The Switch 2, released on June 5, has been met with much fanfare, with people lining up for hours ahead of midnight releases at Nintendo stores.
