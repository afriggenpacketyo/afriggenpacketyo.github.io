          <p>Syrian political activist Shadi Martini addressed Israel's parliament, conveying a message from Syria's transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa urging swift action on a peace deal. The message highlights a rare opportunity for normalization, regional security, and economic prosperity, though unresolved issues like the Golan Heights and the Palestinian situation remain. This initiative, reportedly encouraged by former President Donald Trump, signals a potential shift in regional dynamics, with Martini noting that many in Syria now see peace as necessary for stability and investment. The visit is seen as a historic moment, aiming to clarify Syria's position directly to Israeli lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The UK will begin returning some migrants who arrive in small boats to France within weeks under a new "one in, one out" pilot program. For each migrant returned, the UK will accept a verified asylum seeker from France, aiming to disrupt the business model of people smugglers. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, announced the plan, stating it would demonstrate that illegal crossings are futile. While details on selection criteria are pending, the scheme is part of a broader collaboration that also includes coordinating nuclear deterrents and AI development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high above $113,000, driven by a broader investor shift into risk assets and significant short liquidations. Over $318 million in short positions were liquidated in a 24-hour period, which fueled the upward price momentum. The rally also lifted other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, and boosted crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and Riot Platforms. This price action follows weeks of consolidation and is supported by strong inflows into bitcoin ETFs and large purchases by public companies, indicating sustained institutional interest.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to expand the service area for its robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, and integrate the xAI chatbot, Grok, into Tesla vehicles. The announcement comes as Musk navigates a turbulent period, including a public feud with President Trump and the recent departure of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. The integration of Grok follows controversy over the chatbot's recent antisemitic posts, with an updated version, Grok 4, being rolled out. These developments occur amid investor concerns over slowing sales and the potential impact of Musk's political conflicts on his companies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the country's only operational rare earth miner, through a $400 million investment. This public-private partnership aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are critical for military technology like F-35 jets and drones, reducing reliance on China. The investment will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing capacity and the construction of a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the Pentagon agreeing to purchase its entire output for 10 years. The deal also includes a guaranteed minimum price for key rare earth compounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and projected a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian noted that bookings have stabilized after a previous dip, giving the airline confidence despite lowering its full-year earnings forecast from initial projections. The positive report was driven by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express, which helped offset a drop in main cabin revenue. The airline's performance provides an optimistic signal for the broader airline industry, which has faced consumer hesitancy and tariff concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a period of steady decline, interest rates for home equity loans and HELOCs have flattened, with average rates for both products hovering around 8.26%. While these rates remain more favorable than those for credit cards or personal loans, the current pause may leave homeowners uncertain about their next move. The article suggests that potential borrowers can use this time strategically by checking their credit reports, shopping for competitive lenders, and carefully deciding between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate HELOC. Being prepared will allow homeowners to act quickly when rates eventually begin to fall again. (not investment advice)</p>

While details are not yet public, this could involve creating fares with fewer amenities like lounge access or, conversely, ultra-premium options with more space.

Ives raised his 12-month price target for the stock to $600, suggesting the market has not yet fully priced in the company's future growth potential in AI.

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods, disaster preparedness experts are sharing crucial safety advice. Before a storm, it is vital to understand your home's flood risk, create a household evacuation plan, and pack a "go bag" with essentials. During a flood, the primary goal is to get to higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches of moving water can sweep a person away. If trapped in a car, escape through a window before it is submerged. After the storm, wait for the all-clear from authorities before returning home.</p>
