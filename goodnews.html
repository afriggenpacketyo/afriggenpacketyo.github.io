          <p>According to media reports, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit China for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first trip to the country in seven years. The potential visit signals a continuing thaw in relations between the two Asian powers, which had deteriorated significantly after a deadly border clash in 2020. This diplomatic development is particularly noteworthy as it comes at a time of increasing trade tensions between India and the United States.</p>
