          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. In a social media post, he urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which was mediated by Qatar and Egypt, stating that the terms would not improve for the group. The announcement comes amid ongoing conflict that began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, and ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Israeli officials have expressed a desire for a ceasefire to secure the release of remaining hostages, Hamas has historically insisted on a permanent truce.</p>

          <p>The "Quad" nations‚Äîthe United States, Japan, India, and Australia‚Äîhave announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The move is a clear effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the market for minerals essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies. In a joint statement, the group expressed concern about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions stemming from dependence on a single country. The announcement was made after a meeting of the countries' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., signaling a strengthening of the strategic alliance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration, under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, had planned to end the program in September, revoking legal status and work permits. However, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan determined the administration lacks the authority to vacate the designation before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge noted that migrants had enrolled in schools and jobs in reliance on the existing deadline, while the White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>This article proposes that investors seeking exposure to the energy sector without the volatility of oil prices should consider midstream companies. These firms, which own infrastructure like pipelines, tend to have reliable cash flows based on demand for energy transport rather than commodity prices. The article contrasts the dividend reliability of companies like Enterprise Products Partners and Enbridge with the past cuts from Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer. It argues that the former's history of consistent dividend growth and strong financial foundations make them more trustworthy choices for income-focused investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a key figure in shaping the cultural landscape of Los Angeles, has died at the age of 105. A decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer, Nicholas was instrumental in the development of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. He was nicknamed "Mr. Downtown Culture" for his leadership in transforming the city into a global arts hub. Beyond the arts, he founded Public Counsel in 1970, which grew to become the nation's largest pro bono law firm.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border reached a historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded instances. This continues a significant decline in illegal immigration, which the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and a halt on releasing migrants into the U.S. The current numbers are a stark contrast to the record levels seen under the previous administration. The administration's strategy includes swift deportations, increased military presence, and a messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation, though these tactics have faced criticism and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's toughest law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, nicknamed "Amara's Law," was inspired by the powerful testimony of Amara Strande, a 20-year-old who was dying of a rare cancer she believed was linked to contaminated water in her community. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The chemical manufacturer 3M, which developed PFAS, has agreed to stop producing the chemicals and pay the state $850 million for cleanup efforts.</p>

The article highlights the story of a soldier whose life was saved when a magnet was used to pull a large piece of drone shrapnel from his heart.

He noted that Microsoft's stock surged after its Azure cloud business beat growth expectations, while Nvidia rallied due to the persistent and unrivaled demand for its AI chips. Cramer suggested Meta's success was driven by its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to quarterly earnings that significantly surpassed estimates. He dubbed the trio the "M-N-Ms," distinguishing them from the rest of the market group. (not investment advice)</p>
