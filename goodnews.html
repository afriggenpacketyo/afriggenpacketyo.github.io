          <p>The Walt Disney Company has issued a cease and desist letter to Character.AI, an artificial intelligence startup, for the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters, emphasizing the need to protect intellectual property in the AI era. Character.AI has since removed the characters in question and expressed its commitment to partnering with rightsholders to develop interactive and revenue-generating experiences on its platform. This legal action highlights the growing tension between AI innovation and copyright protection, mirroring Disney's ongoing lawsuit against AI image creator Midjourney for similar infringements. The startup, which secured a significant licensing deal with Google, has also faced a wrongful death lawsuit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A looming U.S. government shutdown is expected to have a largely limited impact on conventional mortgage applications, as private lenders will continue operations. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs, or USDA could face minor processing delays due to potential worker furloughs. Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's flood insurance program, crucial for federally backed mortgages in high-risk areas, may halt new and renewal policies. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could also experience bottlenecks if federal verification services, such as the IRS, are affected.</p>

The company's initial focus involves a partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense, aiming to solve critical power supply issues in battlefields.

          <p>Nike reported a surprise 1% increase in revenue for its fiscal first quarter, significantly outperforming its own previous projections of a mid-single-digit sales decline. The company also exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimates for both earnings per share and overall revenue, signaling a stronger-than-anticipated market performance. However, despite this positive sales growth, Nike's net income experienced a 31% drop compared to the prior year, and its gross margin decreased by 3.2 percentage points. This margin compression was primarily driven by steep discounts and increased tariffs, underscoring that the sneaker giant's comprehensive turnaround efforts, particularly in managing inventory, are still actively underway.</p>

This move comes as Berkshire Hathaway sits on a record $344 billion cash reserve. The article highlights Buffett's long-standing interest in Occidental, including a $10 billion investment in 2019 and subsequent stock purchases. With Buffett stepping down as CEO at the end of 2025, his successor Greg Abel, known for energy industry expertise, is well-positioned for such a deal, signaling continued strategic investments for the conglomerate.

          <p>Members of the Academy of Magical Arts (AMA) have overwhelmingly voted to transfer control of the Magic Castle's operations and revenue to a company owned by landlord Randy Pitchford. This decision allows the AMA to retain the historic Hollywood mansion as its clubhouse while focusing on promoting magic and educational programs, avoiding the need to find a new venue after its lease expires in 2028. The move follows a period of significant changes for the Magic Castle, including past allegations of sexual harassment and a leadership overhaul, and some members expressed concerns about the loss of self-governance.</p>

          <p>Pfizer's recent acquisition, Metsera, is showing early promise with its lead obesity drug candidate, MET-097i, after releasing encouraging mid-stage trial data. This development paves the way for Phase 3 studies later this year for the injectable GLP-1 class drug, which aims for convenient once-a-month dosing. Initial results from the VESPER-1 trial demonstrated an average weight loss of up to 14.1% after 28 weeks, with some participants achieving 26.5% loss, alongside reportedly fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to existing weekly injections. Analysts anticipate MET-097i will become a significant competitor in the growing obesity treatment market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages offer older homeowners a way to access home equity without monthly payments, but require careful consideration to avoid potential pitfalls. This article advises against ignoring true costs, such as origination fees, mortgage insurance, and ongoing property taxes. It also stresses the importance of understanding the impact on heirs, who will need to repay the loan or refinance to keep the property. Borrowers are cautioned not to take more money than necessary, as this increases accruing interest, and to be aware of how proceeds might affect eligibility for means-tested government benefits. Seeking independent professional guidance beyond mandatory counseling is strongly recommended. (not investment advice)</p>
