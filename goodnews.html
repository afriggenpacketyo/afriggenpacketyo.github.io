          <p>Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, marking a new chapter in his NFL career after a split with the New York Jets. The one-year contract is worth $13.65 million guaranteed, potentially reaching $19.5 million, pending a physical. Rodgers' move to the Steelers follows months of speculation and a turbulent tenure with the Jets, which was cut short by injury and conflict. While some experts express skepticism, Rodgers is set to hold a press conference after minicamp practice to discuss his decision to join the team, where he will face his former team, the Green Bay Packers, in Week 8.</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the department's plans following the House settlement with the NCAA, which allows schools to pay athletes directly. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing while preserving Olympic sports programs and athletic department staff. The school will also maintain current scholarship limits for at least one year to distribute more revenue sharing money to each player. Payments will rise each year as part of the 10-year settlement agreement, and UCLA is seeking a third-party partner to help secure NIL opportunities for its athletes.</p>

          <p>A Seattle man, Earl Henderson Riley IV, has been charged with multiple counts of residential burglary and one count of robbery for targeting the homes of professional athletes. The victims include Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell, Seattle Mariners center fielder Julio Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners pitcher Luis Castillo, and former Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. The King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said the investigation, which began in early 2025, involved six different police jurisdictions. The suspect is currently held in King County Jail on $1 million bail, and the investigation remains ongoing, with the possibility of additional charges against other defendants.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken her first flight from the nest, following her sister Sunny who took flight earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, had been practicing for their first flight by flapping their wings and jumping from branch to branch. Gizmo's first flight occurred at 89 days old after intense wing exercises, and while their future whereabouts are uncertain, young eagles typically return to the nest soon after their first flight. Sunny has been returning to the nest since her first flight, indicating that the eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards, the new head coach of England's women's cricket team, began her tenure with a clean sweep over the West Indies in both T20 and one-day international matches. While this victory provides a positive start, it's important to note that England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled in major tournaments. The real test for Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt will come with tougher challenges, such as the upcoming series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The question remains whether this "new" England team can perform under pressure when it truly matters.</p>

Yusuf explained that his initial resignation was due to exhaustion after working for 11 months to build the party, and he still believes in Nigel Farage's leadership.</p>

The DOGE team was initially led by Musk, who has since left the administration, but the team's efforts to cut costs and streamline government operations are ongoing. The team's work is focused on identifying inefficiencies and implementing reforms across various government agencies.</p>
