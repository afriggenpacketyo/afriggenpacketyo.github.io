          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C. finds his claims to be misleading. While D.C. did experience a crime spike in 2023, the article clarifies that violent crime and homicide rates have significantly decreased in 2024 and 2025, a trend consistent with national statistics. The analysis points out that comparing the district to states is inappropriate, and when compared to other major cities, D.C. is not the most violent, contrary to the president's justification for federalizing the local police force.</p>

          <p>A tech analyst has described potential U.S. government intervention in Intel as "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. The argument posits that such a move is necessary to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on foreign chip manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. While acknowledging the move is contrary to free-market principles, the analyst contends that ensuring U.S. control over critical chip manufacturing is a national security imperative, similar to controlling the production of military hardware.

          <p>In an effort to combat rising retail theft, UK supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers a £1 reward for reporting shoplifting incidents to staff. The company's executive chairman stated that theft costs the business £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in wages. This initiative comes as shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest level in over two decades. The store clarified that customers should not confront suspected thieves but should alert an employee to receive the credit on their loyalty card.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are prioritizing paying down their credit card debt, which collectively exceeds $1.2 trillion amid high interest rates. The financial burden is compounded for the 45% of adults carrying balances on multiple cards, making repayment more complex. The article outlines several strategies for tackling this debt, including debt forgiveness programs, management plans from credit counseling agencies, and consolidation through loans or balance transfers. These approaches aim to simplify payments and reduce the overall cost of borrowing for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the work of Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, prompted by a new biography and a first-time reading of her most famous novel, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It highlights Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her exploration of moral education, particularly through the lens of her Catholic faith. The analysis of "Miss Jean Brodie" focuses not on the titular teacher but on the lasting, complex influence she has on her students, especially Sandy, whose path to becoming a nun is framed as a final break from her mentor's control.</p>

          <p>"Yellowstone" creator Taylor Sheridan is partnering with Paramount to develop a large-scale film production campus in Fort Worth, Texas. The 450,000-square-foot facility will be the largest in the state and is expected to serve as a hub for Sheridan's productions, such as "Landman" and "Lioness." This venture aligns with Texas's recent efforts to attract more film production, including a significant increase in its film incentives program. The new studio is seen as a major boost to the state's entertainment economy and a move by Sheridan to centralize his growing television empire in his home state.</p>

          <h2>A Critical Ranking of Film and Television Adaptations of John Grisham's Novels</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive and opinionated ranking of the film and television adaptations of John Grisham's legal thrillers. It evaluates nine different productions, from the highly acclaimed 1993 film "The Pelican Brief" to the less successful 2012 TV version of "The Firm." Each entry is assessed based on its plot, casting, and how well it captures the "Grisham score"—the quintessential feel of an underdog taking on a powerful, corrupt system. The list praises films like "The Rainmaker" and "The Pelican Brief" for their pacing and casting while critiquing others for straying too far from the source material's core themes.</p>

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has occurred in the Geysers geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are common in this area and are induced by the operations of the geothermal power facility located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity causes stresses in the surrounding rock, leading to frequent, minor seismic activity. The USGS notes that this activity is distinct from the region's major fault lines.</p>

          <p>Despite rising home prices nationwide, a new Zillow analysis finds that mansions, defined as homes with over 5,000 square feet, can still be purchased for under $1 million in a few U.S. metro areas. Cities such as Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Memphis offer large homes below this price point, contrasting sharply with coastal markets like San Jose where the median mansion costs $6.5 million. These more affordable markets tend to feature older homes, and their lower prices reflect broader regional affordability trends. Just three years ago, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued below $1 million. (not investment advice)</p>
