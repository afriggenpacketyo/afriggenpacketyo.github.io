          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy shift, allowing verified adult ChatGPT users to access erotic materials starting in December. This move aims to treat adult users like adults, relaxing previous restrictive content policies implemented to mitigate mental health risks. New safety features and parental controls, rolled out last month, are cited as enabling this change. Additionally, a new ChatGPT version will launch soon, allowing for more distinct chatbot personalities based on user preferences.</p>

          <p>The USA men's national soccer team secured a 2-1 victory over Australia in a friendly match, with Haji Wright scoring both goals after falling behind early. Captain Christian Pulisic exited the game in the first half due to a lower leg injury following several heavy challenges. The match saw the USA control possession and create chances, despite Australia's initial lead from Jordy Bos. Tensions flared towards the end of the first half, but the USA maintained control in the second to seal the win.</p>

          <p>Fesia Davenport, Los Angeles County’s chief executive officer, received a $2 million settlement this summer due to professional fallout from Measure G, a voter-approved ballot measure. Measure G will make her appointed position obsolete by 2028, transitioning to an elected role. Davenport cited "reputational harm, embarrassment, and physical, emotional and mental distress" caused by the measure in her letter to the county counsel. The settlement prevents her from suing the county over issues related to Measure G, which she stated irrevocably changed her professional career and economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump expressed strong disapproval of a Time magazine cover photo, despite the accompanying article being positive about his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. He described the picture, taken from a low angle with backlighting, as "super bad," claiming it "disappeared" his hair and created a "floating crown" effect. Trump's long-standing obsession with Time covers is well-documented, including previous instances of displaying mocked-up covers. The article explores the photographic choices, suggesting they aimed for a heroic feel, but acknowledged the aesthetic wasn't flattering.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several bills aimed at enhancing the safety of artificial intelligence and social media for minors. Senate Bill 243 mandates AI companies to implement guardrails against self-harm content and alert minors that chatbots are not human.

Additionally, AB 621 increases penalties for creating nonconsensual AI pornography, and AB 56 will require warning labels on social media platforms for minors.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol in Central California stopped a Nissan Sentra equipped with a homemade, hand-drawn license plate instead of a state-issued one. Despite the driver's creativity, the CHP deemed the artwork insufficient and issued a $197 fine for operating a vehicle without proper registration. The incident was shared on social media, with the department giving "points for creativity" but underscoring the legal requirement for official license plates. California law mandates the display of state-issued plates on all vehicles.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the order for 28 new B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, as members of the existing B-2 team recounted their successful 36-hour mission, Operation Midnight Hammer, against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June. Commanders praised the B-2's unique combination of long-range, high payload, and stealth capabilities, essential for penetrating advanced enemy airspace. The mission, escorted by F-22 and F-35 tactical fighters, was described as "perfect" by Major General Jason Armagost. The B-2's ability to deliver Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs to deep underground targets was crucial for the operation.</p>

          <p>Instagram, owned by Meta, is rolling out new content restrictions for users under 18, aligning with PG-13 movie ratings to ensure age-appropriate content. Teen accounts will automatically be placed under a 13+ setting, requiring parental permission to opt out. These restrictions will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. Meta is also applying these regulations to its AI technology integrated into Instagram, aiming to reassure parents about showing safe content while giving them more control over their teen's online experience.</p>
