          <p>The European Commission is formally requesting information from four major U.S. tech platforms—Apple, Google's YouTube, Snap, and Google Play—regarding their child protection practices. The inquiry, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), will examine concerns such as easily circumvented age restrictions, addictive algorithms, and access to inappropriate content like gambling apps. If the EU executive finds infringements of its rules, it could open formal proceedings and impose fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover, signaling a continued regulatory focus on online safety for minors.</p>

          <p>Actress Alex Kingston, known for her roles in 'ER' and 'Doctor Who,' has publicly revealed that she was diagnosed with womb cancer last year. The 62-year-old star underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, completing her treatment in late 2024. Kingston stated that she initially mistook her symptoms for signs of aging and is now urging others not to ignore potential health issues. She credits the experience with inspiring her to participate in the television show 'Strictly Come Dancing,' embracing the philosophy that life is too short to pass up desired opportunities.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman grave marker discovered in a New Orleans backyard has been traced back to a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II. The soldier's granddaughter, Erin Scott O’Brien, revealed that her grandfather had kept the 1,900-year-old artifact, which she later used as a garden decoration and inadvertently left behind when she sold the house in 2018. The new owners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the Latin inscription and learned it was a headstone reported missing from an Italian museum, prompting efforts to repatriate the historical object.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that a prominent Democrat should immediately declare their candidacy for the 2028 presidential election to create a clear and early alternative to President Trump. The author contends that current Democratic leadership lacks charisma and that waiting for Trump to falter is a failed strategy. The piece suggests that an early, bold campaign focused on substantive issues could capture national attention, galvanize opposition, and prevent the president from having an unchallenged platform for the next several years.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues in Favor of Academic Tracking in Schools Despite Equity Concerns</h2>

          <p>Following New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal to end kindergarten 'gifted and talented' programs, this article analyzes the broader debate over academic tracking in U.S. education. It argues that while such programs often result in racial disparities, these may stem from underlying socioeconomic inequalities rather than biased selection processes. The analysis suggests that well-designed tracking programs can benefit students at all achievement levels by allowing for tailored instruction and can also help retain affluent families in public school systems.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has officially taken effect in Gaza, marking the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace initiative. The Israeli cabinet ratified the deal, which includes the withdrawal of some Israeli troops and paves the way for the return of all remaining hostages. The announcement brought expressions of relief from both Israelis and Palestinians after a brutal two-year conflict, though the path to a lasting peace remains uncertain. The deal is seen as a fulfillment of a campaign promise by President Trump.</p>

          <p>The United States will deploy up to 200 troops currently based in the Middle East to Israel to help monitor the newly enacted ceasefire in Gaza. These forces will not enter Gaza but will establish a multinational civil-military coordination center to oversee the truce and coordinate humanitarian aid. The taskforce, led by U.S. Central Command, is expected to include personnel from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. This move is a key component of the U.S.-brokered peace plan aimed at ensuring compliance from both Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>This article examines Washington Irving's classic story "Rip Van Winkle" as a foundational piece of American literature that explores national identity and memory. Published in 1819, the tale of a man who sleeps through the American Revolution is presented as a commentary on the radical transformation of the country and the challenge of creating a new culture while retaining ties to the past. The story's enduring popularity, from stage adaptations to its influence on later characters, highlights its success in solving the very problem it identified: providing a common story that the new nation could know by heart.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores Abraham Lincoln's engagement with the legacy of the American Revolution as a guide for navigating contemporary political divisions. It posits that Lincoln viewed the Revolution not as a static, flawless event but as an unfinished project whose core ideals, particularly the promise of equality in the Declaration of Independence, could be used to redeem the nation's past and address the crisis of slavery. By framing the Civil War as a second founding meant to fulfill the first, Lincoln offered a dynamic way to confront national contradictions without discarding foundational principles.</p>

          <p>Amanda Vaill's new book, 'Pride and Pleasure,' offers a biographical look at the Schuyler sisters—Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy—repositioning them as central figures in the American Revolution. The article discusses how the book challenges traditional male-centric histories by focusing on the domestic and political lives of these influential women, particularly Eliza Schuyler Hamilton. By detailing Eliza's 50-year widowhood, during which she preserved her husband's legacy and co-founded an orphan asylum, the book argues for a more integrated understanding of history where the household and public spheres are intertwined.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Colonial Williamsburg, America's largest living-history museum, is navigating the challenge of presenting a more complete and truthful narrative of the nation's founding. The site has evolved from a nostalgic, patriotic vision to one that directly confronts the paradox of liberty and slavery, telling the stories of the enslaved Black majority who lived there. This commitment to historical accuracy often makes visitors uncomfortable and has drawn criticism from both ends of the political spectrum, highlighting the ongoing debate over how to teach American history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's highly successful diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" and hyperbolic vituperation within the context of a rap battle, rather than verifiable facts a reasonable listener would believe. Drake had sued UMG, which releases music for both artists, for publishing and promoting the track, alleging it tarnished his reputation and led to security threats.</p>

          <p>The Tenement Museum in New York City provides an alternative approach to history education by focusing on the lives of ordinary immigrant, migrant, and African American families. By recreating the actual apartments of these families from the 1860s through the 1980s, the museum makes history tangible and relatable for students. This method emphasizes that everyone, not just prominent leaders, is a part of the American story. It aims to balance the harsh realities of poverty and discrimination with the hope and progress these families experienced.</p>
