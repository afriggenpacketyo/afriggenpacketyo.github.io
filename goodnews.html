          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a significant visit to the Maldives, aiming to reinforce relations with the island nation as it has recently tilted towards China. The visit comes after Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on an anti-India platform, toned down his rhetoric and emphasized the historic partnership. During the trip, Modi announced a $565 million credit line, reduced repayment terms on a previous loan, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, underscoring the strategic importance of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, the acclaimed film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is set to get a sequel, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Chadha stated that the recent success of women's football, particularly the England Lionesses, makes it an opportune time to revisit the characters. While the format is undecided—potentially a film or TV series—the director is aiming for a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup. The original movie was a cultural touchstone that inspired many young women to pursue football.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a temporary spokesperson for Astronomer, the tech company recently embroiled in a viral KissCam scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after being filmed in an intimate embrace at a Coldplay concert, a band fronted by Paltrow's ex-husband, Chris Martin. In a short video, Paltrow humorously addressed the company's newfound attention, steering the conversation toward its data workflow automation services. The move appears to be a public relations effort to navigate the awkward publicity and shift focus back to the company's business.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he has spoken with the leaders of both Cambodia and Thailand, stating that both nations are seeking an immediate ceasefire to end deadly border fighting. The conflict, centered around disputed territory including the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 130,000 people. Trump indicated that he is prepared to finalize trade agreements with both countries once peace is achieved. While officials from the two nations have not immediately confirmed the talks, the announcement follows calls for dialogue from the UN Security Council.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Sweden international striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a total fee of €73 million. The 27-year-old, who joins on a five-year contract, cited the team's strength, which he experienced firsthand when Sporting played against them in the Champions League, as a key factor in his decision. Gyokeres has been a prolific goalscorer in Portugal, with 97 goals in 102 matches over two seasons. The signing is a major addition to Arsenal's squad, concluding a long-running transfer saga and boosting the club's summer spending to approximately £204 million.</p>

          <p>Recent research presents a complex picture of coffee's health effects, with experts advising that the right amount varies for each individual. While some studies link daily coffee consumption to healthy aging and lower mortality rates, others show potential risks for dementia and cardiovascular disease, particularly for those with hypertension. The FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, but dietitians stress that personal tolerance is key. Individuals should be mindful of effects like anxiety or poor sleep and adjust their intake accordingly, reinforcing the principle of moderation for daily consumption.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Regulatory Function in 'Junk' DNA from Ancient Viruses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 11:15:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team has discovered that a class of "junk" DNA, which originated from a virus that infected primate ancestors millions of years ago, plays a significant role in regulating human genes. These DNA sequences, known as MER11 transposable elements, were previously thought to be non-functional. The study found that younger versions of these elements contain motifs that attract proteins to act as "genetic switches," influencing which genes are turned on or off. This finding reveals a new layer of evolutionary complexity and suggests that vast portions of the genome once considered junk are functionally important.</p>

          <p>A routine X-ray revealed that Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer with no symptoms, had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal lung disease. After medications failed and his condition worsened, he was given less than a year to live but was approved for a double-lung transplant at age 74. Following the successful surgery, Kennedy has recovered remarkably, with his lung capacity now at 98%. He is back to training hospital therapy dogs, a passion that has become more meaningful after his own medical journey and second chance at life.</p>
