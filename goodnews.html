          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term, marking a historic win for the Labor Party. The election was fought against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with both Labor and the opposition coalition, led by Peter Dutton, focusing on energy policy and inflation. Dutton's campaign faced criticism for allegedly mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and divisive tactics, leading to the moniker "DOGE-y Dutton." Albanese emphasized his government's improved relations with China, highlighting the removal of trade barriers. The New York Times article emphasizes that voters opted for the known quantity of the incumbent leader, Anthony Albanese, amid global uncertainty arising from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Inspired by NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's public service announcement about atrial fibrillation, Warren Donaldson sought medical attention for his symptoms, leading to the discovery of an orange-sized mass in his heart. Doctors at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center identified the mass as a pericardiac cyst, an extremely rare condition. The cyst was compressing Donaldson's right ventricular outflow tract, causing heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Donaldson underwent open-heart surgery to remove the cyst and reconstruct his RVOT, enabling him to return to normalcy and resume his active lifestyle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches aides to avoid using 'elderspeak,' a form of communication resembling baby talk, when interacting with older adults. Elderspeak, characterized by inappropriate endearments, simplified language, and controlling tones, can lead to resistance to care and lower use of antipsychotic drugs. The CHAT program, which includes videos of communication between staff and patients, has shown success in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes. The program emphasizes addressing clients respectfully and negotiating communication preferences to combat ageist assumptions.</p>

The charming salamanders, also known as Mexican walking fish, not only survived but gained weight, indicating successful hunting and predator avoidance. The study suggests that reintroducing captive-bred axolotls to restored wetlands can aid in the species' comeback, despite their critically endangered status. The ability to survive in man-made habitats also offers hope for mitigating habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
