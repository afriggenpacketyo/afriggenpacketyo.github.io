          <p>Alphabet's stock rose 8% after a federal judge ruled against the most severe remedies proposed by the Department of Justice in its landmark antitrust case. The court decided that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser or the Android operating system. While Google must end certain exclusive contracts and share some search data with rivals, investors reacted positively, viewing the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant and a sign that the market had anticipated more draconian measures.

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals via a walkover after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew due to injury shortly before their quarter-final match. This sets up a highly anticipated semifinal clash with American fourth seed Jessica Pegula, who secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets. Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, has had a career plagued by injuries, and her withdrawal marks a disappointing end to her run at the tournament.</p>

Initially, the vehicles will be operated manually by human safety drivers to validate the technology and operations in these new environments. This move is part of Waymo's broader strategy to roll out its fully autonomous, driverless ride-hailing service across the country, which is already commercially available in cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The test fleets will use a mix of Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The ban would apply to various retailers, including shops, restaurants, and online stores, and targets drinks like Red Bull and Prime. Health Secretary Wes Streeting cited concerns from parents and teachers about the health impacts of these drinks, as excessive caffeine consumption in children is linked to headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. A 12-week consultation will now gather evidence before the law is finalized.</p>

In Cook's case, he is at the forefront of a fight over presidential authority and the independence of the Federal Reserve, arguing that the allegations against Cook are a pretext for political retribution.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser but imposed other penalties to curb its monopoly in the search market. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ordered Google to end exclusive default-search-engine deals with device makers and to share some user interaction and search index data with third parties. The ruling, which falls short of the DOJ's most aggressive demands, is seen as the most consequential tech antitrust decision in over two decades and sets a critical precedent for regulators.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, and asset managers Apollo and Brookfield. The acquisition, valued at about $28.2 billion including debt, marks a significant consolidation in the airplane-renting business, which owns over half of the world's passenger jets. The deal comes as the leasing industry benefits from a shortage of new aircraft, which has pushed rental rates to record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of employees at California's Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon national parks have overwhelmingly voted to unionize with the National Federation of Federal Employees. The move comes amid significant turmoil within the National Park Service, which has faced unprecedented staff and budget cuts under the Trump administration, leading to overworked and demoralized staff. Organizers say the successful union drive was fueled by employee concerns over reductions in force, threats to workplace protections, and the strain of managing the parks with inadequate resources.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight increase on Tuesday, rising above the $110,000 mark while the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The market turbulence was driven by concerns over the legality of U.S. tariffs, which also propelled gold to a new record high above $3,500. While Bitcoin benefited from some safe-haven interest, its performance lagged behind gold, partly due to a recent investor rotation into Ethereum, which has been the crypto market leader for much of the summer.
