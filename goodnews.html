          <p>Rivian Automotive exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but adjusted its 2025 delivery target downward to between 40,000 and 46,000 units and increased its capital spending to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. The electric vehicle manufacturer cited the uncertain global economic landscape, particularly evolving trade regulations, policies, and tariffs, as factors influencing consumer sentiment and demand. Despite these adjustments, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year and anticipates losses of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The company also noted it ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in liquidity, including $7.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enforce Real ID requirements, potentially causing disruptions for travelers without compliant identification. While other forms of ID, such as passports and military IDs, will be accepted, those without Real IDs may face additional screening. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem assured lawmakers that travelers will still be allowed to fly, but should expect extra steps, and the TSA recommends arriving at least three hours before domestic flights for identity verification. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to improve security and minimize fraud, and a Real ID card has a star marking at the upper-right part of the card, according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, with overall sales surging by 36%. The company's data center segment, which includes server CPUs and GPUs, saw a 57% increase in sales, driven by demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. The Client and Gaming segment also experienced growth, with laptop and PC chip sales rising 68% due to strong demand for Zen 5 chips, though gaming sales declined 30% due to reduced console chip revenue. AMD's forecast included $800 million in costs due to U.S. export restrictions on some of its artificial-intelligence chips.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz was elected Germany's 10th postwar chancellor on Tuesday, but only after failing to secure enough votes in the first parliamentary ballot. This unprecedented stumble raised concerns about his ability to project strength and pass critical legislation, particularly amid economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Despite winning on the second ballot, rival parties and analysts cautioned that his credibility had suffered, and his opponents questioned his legitimacy. Merz now faces the task of reviving Germany's economy, addressing immigration concerns, and countering threats from Russia and the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>California Democratic lawmakers have reached a deal on legislation concerning the solicitation of minors, increasing the penalty for soliciting a minor aged 16 or 17. The new amendments to AB 379 would allow prosecutors to file felony charges against adults who solicit sex from a 16- or 17-year-old, particularly if the accused is three years older than the minor. The bill will also include a state grant program to help streamline prosecution in human trafficking and sex trafficking cases, and a support fund for survivors.</p>
