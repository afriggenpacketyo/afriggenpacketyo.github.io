          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs will lead to price increases. CEO Doug McMillon stated that while the company will try to keep prices low, tariffs are too significant to fully absorb, and shoppers could see price increases soon. The company's U.S. store sales rose over 3%, and e-commerce sales jumped more than 20%, recording its first profitable quarter, and Walmart maintained its full-year financial forecast. Despite this, tariffs are weighing on the company, with potential price increases expected for discretionary items like electronics and toys, and the company will aim to keep food prices as low as possible.

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief but also carries long-term consequences, especially concerning lenders' perceptions of creditworthiness. While the settled credit card account is likely closed, other accounts might remain open, though debt settlement can significantly damage credit scores. Rebuilding credit involves monitoring credit reports, starting with secured credit cards, and considering authorized user status on trusted accounts. It's crucial to maintain low balances, make timely payments, and wait before applying for new cards to stabilize the credit profile and demonstrate financial responsibility to lenders.

          <p>Coterra Energy's CEO Tom Jorden is set to address investors' concerns on "Mad Money" following disappointing first-quarter earnings that caused a 9% stock drop. The market reacted negatively to higher-than-expected water volumes at wells in the Harkey area of the Permian Basin, raising doubts about the quality of Coterra's inventory. Investors were also disappointed by the lack of planned share buybacks, as management prioritizes debt reduction. The article emphasizes the need for Coterra to resolve the Harkey incident quickly and reassure the market, as exploration and production firms are heavily penalized for operational uncertainties.

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey has warned investors that the retail giant will increase prices on many items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reprieve lowering duties on Chinese imports. The company is trying to mitigate the impact, but shoppers will likely see increases by the end of May and more in June, with higher markups than usual expected in the fiscal second quarter. Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia are putting pressure on imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses, and Walmart is taking steps to reduce tariff exposure by switching materials and sourcing merchandise from different locations. Despite this, Walmart maintains its full-year forecast, anticipating that consumers seeking value amid higher prices may drive shoppers to its stores. (not investment advice)</p>

He has engaged in political discussions, citing the Yalta Conference and proposing a flat-tax plan, and his podcast has become a hub for Democratic strategists seeking to connect with a broader audience.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will work to pull fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing potential health risks that are not based in rigorous research. This move coincides with a wave of bills restricting fluoride use, with Utah and Florida banning its addition to public water. The FDA will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by October 31, pointing to concerns about gut microbiome alterations and potential links to lower I.Q. and thyroid issues. Dentists prescribe fluoride supplements to children in areas without fluoridated water to prevent cavities, but the FDA's action is based on limited evidence, prompting debate among experts about the benefits and risks.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold requires careful consideration rather than a fixed schedule, as it serves as a portfolio component for inflation protection and diversification. The conventional wisdom is that gold shouldn't make up more than 10% of your overall portfolio. Investors should determine their risk profile and how much money they have to invest to get to that 10% maximum. Waiting to get invested in gold is generally not advisable, as over time, the price only increases, accounting for minor drops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has temporarily paused export restrictions targeting 28 American companies following a trade truce with the Trump administration, but continues to block exports of seven rare earth metals to the United States.

Despite the removal of American companies from the export control list, China's Commerce Ministry emphasized the need for broader government control of the metals for national security, viewing them as leverage in trade negotiations.</p>
