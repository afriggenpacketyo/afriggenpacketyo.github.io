          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher as investors await a crucial US jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts in September. While global equities and bonds previously faced sell-offs due to government debt concerns, sentiment improved after payroll data supported rate cut bets without signaling a severe economic downturn. In corporate news, Danish wind farm developer Orsted lowered its full-year earnings guidance, citing lower offshore wind speeds and ongoing political obstructions to its US projects, leading to a lawsuit against the Trump administration. This article highlights the delicate balance between market optimism and underlying economic and corporate challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is actively promoting the country's vast copper and lithium potential to capitalize on surging global demand driven by electrification and renewable energy. His administration has introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), offering significant benefits to large-scale investors, with mining projects, particularly copper, attracting billions in commitments from companies like BHP and Glencore. Industry experts are hailing Argentina as a leading prospect for copper, comparing its potential to Western Australia's iron ore boom. This strategic push aims to stabilize Argentina's volatile economy, though long-term success hinges on policy consistency and social acceptance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles kicked off the NFL season with a 24-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, despite a tumultuous start. The game saw Eagles star defender Jalen Carter ejected just moments in for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, an incident that could lead to further penalties. An hour-long lightning delay in the third quarter further disrupted the contest, which ultimately ended with no further scoring. Jalen Hurts led the Eagles with two rushing touchdowns, securing a hard-fought win in a rivalry game marked by indiscipline and unexpected interruptions.</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, has stated that the UK's national security is assured 'for now and for the next few years.' He attributed this optimism to the UK's status as a nuclear power, its membership in NATO, and its strong alliance with the United States. Sir Tony also praised the UK's robust response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, contrasting it with the reaction to the annexation of Crimea. He described the war as a 'disaster' for Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed skepticism about the formation of a new non-NATO 'axis' involving countries like China.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to impose 'fairly substantial' tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not relocate production to the United States. However, he signaled that firms like Apple, which have committed to expanding domestic investments, would be exempt from these levies. The announcement was made during a White House dinner with prominent tech leaders, where Apple CEO Tim Cook was present. This move aligns with the US's long-standing effort to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with major companies already committing billions to build plants in the country. The specifics of these tariffs and exemptions remain somewhat unclear, but the administration's intent is to incentivize domestic manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bidders seeking to acquire a portion of Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at as much as US$5 billion, according to sources familiar with the discussions. This potential deal would represent one of the largest divestments by a global consumer company in China in recent years. The valuation, roughly 10 times its expected 2025 EBITDA, suggests Starbucks is moving forward with the sale amidst sluggish growth and intense competition from local brands in the Chinese market. This strategic move could allow Starbucks to re-evaluate its approach in a challenging yet crucial international market. (not investment advice)</p>
