          <h2>Genetic Study Fills Gaps in Indigenous Americans' Ancestry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 02:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent DNA study has traced the migration of prehistoric humans from Asia to North and South America, offering insights into the origins of Indigenous groups. The research, published in Science, analyzed genomes from 1,537 individuals across northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing genetic links between modern Indigenous populations and early settlers. The study also found that early settlers split into isolated groups due to geographical barriers, such as the Amazon rainforest and the Andes, leading to distinct genetic traits, including adaptations to high altitudes. This genetic record is crucial for preserving the legacy of endangered groups like the Kawesqar people of Patagonia.</p>

Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries notified them in advance, and relations remain friendly and stable.

          <p>Poland is holding presidential elections amid concerns that the pro-European government's reform plans are being blocked by the current president. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice party. Tusk's government has struggled to implement reforms due to presidential vetoes and a constitutional court filled with PiS supporters, leading to disappointment among voters. The outcome of the election will determine whether the government can advance its agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing social policies.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing a dramatic drop in visibility and disrupting travel. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so, and the first time including the city itself. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust and carrying it into the city. The dust storm caused delays at Midway International Airport and backed up expressways, creating hazardous conditions for drivers. According to the National Weather Service, skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home. He announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and these nations, all major purchasers of American military equipment. The trip included extravagant welcoming ceremonies, meetings with friendly audiences, and campaign-style rallies. While some criticized the ethics of accepting gifts, such as a $400 million airplane, Trump's declaration of shifting U.S. policy toward peace and profit was praised.</p>
