          <p>Max Verstappen claimed pole position for Red Bull in a highly eventful qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which was interrupted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, saw numerous crashes, including from championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc, which significantly shuffled the starting grid. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, while other top drivers like Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton were left with disappointing starting positions for the race.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes achieved record closing highs this week, spurred by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. This marks the first rate reduction since last December, with central bankers signaling the possibility of two more cuts in 2025. The market's positive reaction was also influenced by major tech news, including a partnership between Nvidia and Intel and strong initial demand for Apple's new iPhone 17 models.

The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Doha, Qatar, following negotiations that secured their freedom. The Taliban never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention but stated they were released after judicial proceedings for breaking Afghan laws.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These rights, a condition of the company's takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, U.S. Steel reversed its decision, marking the first time the administration has exercised this power to protect American jobs.</p>

          <p>In an interview at The Atlantic Festival, Monica Lewinsky discussed her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that after years of trying to live anonymously, she decided to embrace her story as a "poster child for having survived shame," particularly after the tragic death of Tyler Clementi. Lewinsky highlighted the cultural shifts since the 1990s, including the emergence of movements like #MeToo and new language to describe power abuses, which have helped reframe her experience.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked cautious optimism for more stable bilateral relations. Both leaders described the talks as productive, covering topics from trade to TikTok, and announced plans to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea. Trump also indicated he may visit China early next year, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions, though analysts remain wary of ongoing friction points like tariffs and Taiwan.</p>

          <p>The United States has seemingly adopted a quieter approach to publicizing its naval warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. While such operations were regularly announced under the previous administration, there have only been three known transits this year, all confirmed only after media inquiries. Beijing has historically criticized the "public hype" of these freedom-of-navigation operations, and some analysts view the change as a tactical shift by the U.S. to reduce direct provocations without altering its underlying policy.</p>

          <p>A leading dermatologist is cautioning that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even while indoors, simply by sitting near a window. While UVB rays, which cause sunburn, are mostly filtered out by glass, UVA rays are not and can penetrate deeply into the skin, accelerating aging and increasing skin cancer risk. Because UVA exposure doesn't cause a burn, people are often unaware of the damage being done, highlighting the importance of using broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily.</p>

The piece suggests that acknowledging one's genuine talents and strengths, rather than dismissing them, is crucial for building self-belief. It frames the struggle as a process of being honest with oneself to overcome the persistent and often unfounded fear of being exposed as a fraud.</p>
