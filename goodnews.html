          <p>OpenAI has recruited Mike Liberatore, xAI's former finance chief, as its new business finance officer, tasked with overseeing the company's substantial infrastructure spending. This strategic hiring intensifies the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk, former collaborators who became bitter rivals as OpenAI transitioned into a commercial entity. Liberatore's move, following a brief stint at xAI and extensive experience at firms like Airbnb and PayPal, underscores the fierce competition for top talent in the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. OpenAI, recently valued at $500 billion, is steadily increasing its compute commitments, including a $300 billion deal with Oracle, indicating a strong focus on scaling its operations and technological capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. retail sales increased by a better-than-expected 0.6% in August compared to July, marking a second consecutive month of growth following earlier declines. This surge was primarily driven by back-to-school purchases and consumers proactively buying goods before anticipated price increases. The Commerce Department's report highlighted robust spending across diverse sectors, including a 0.3% rise in electronics and appliance sales, a 2% increase for online retailers, and a 0.7% boost in restaurant business. Despite this positive spending trend, President Trump’s tariffs are concurrently beginning to exert pressure on the job market and contribute to overall price hikes, presenting a nuanced economic environment.

          <p>A Gallup survey indicates that 62% of U.S. adults dream of being their own boss, yet many are held back by concerns over finances, fear of failure, and insufficient business knowledge. Experts provide practical tips to navigate these obstacles, advising aspiring entrepreneurs to establish realistic savings targets, such as covering six months of expenses, instead of delaying indefinitely for an ideal financial cushion. They also suggest validating business concepts through side hustles and considering service-based ventures that typically require less initial capital. Developing a clear understanding of one's value proposition and fostering relationships with experienced mentors are highlighted as essential steps for achieving sustainable entrepreneurial success and building resilience.</p>

          <p>Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has reportedly undertaken internal evaluations concerning the "frontier risks" of its AI models, as disclosed by a source familiar with the matter. These frontier risks encompass the potentially significant threats that advanced AI systems could pose to public safety and broader social stability. This initiative aligns with Beijing's ongoing efforts to foster greater awareness and responsibility regarding AI safety within China's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. Notably, unlike leading U.S. AI firms such as Anthropic and OpenAI, which regularly publish their frontier risk assessment findings, Chinese companies have historically refrained from announcing such detailed results publicly, raising questions about transparency.</p>

          <p>Lauren Choi, an engineering student, founded The New Norm, a company that innovatively upcycles problematic red party cups and other post-consumer plastics into stylish and sustainable apparel like sweatshirts and beanies. Recognizing the significant recycling challenges associated with these plastics, Choi and her team developed an extruder machine capable of spinning plastic waste into wearable textile filaments. Despite initial difficulties in achieving a soft, comfortable fabric feel, collaboration with specialized textile centers enabled the creation of a custom formula for their materials. The company's debut collection, crafted from 5,000 upcycled cups, sold out rapidly, showcasing a promising pathway for addressing the global plastics crisis through fashion.</p>

          <p>Amidst an industry-wide oversupply of flights that has compelled airlines to reduce fares and temper growth, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expresses strong confidence in his company's continued expansion. United is projected to increase its domestic U.S. capacity by 5.7% in 2025, significantly exceeding the growth rates of its major competitors. Kirby attributes this robust performance to United's compelling product, extensive network, and advanced technology, asserting that these factors are driving customer preference. He anticipates that the airline's resilience will be clearly demonstrated in its upcoming fourth-quarter results, highlighting the potential for substantial upside as the economy begins to recover.

          <p>Europe is preparing for the upcoming winter with its gas reserves at over 80% capacity, providing a substantial buffer despite being slightly below the levels of the last few years. In the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, EU nations have successfully diversified their energy supplies, shifting towards liquefied natural gas (LNG) from sources like Norway, the U.S., and Qatar, while also accelerating the deployment of renewable energies. This strategic pivot has significantly enhanced Europe's energy independence and resilience against potential supply disruptions. Nonetheless, the bloc remains susceptible to geopolitical shocks, notably from U.S. President Trump's proposed tariffs on countries engaging in energy deals with Moscow, which could introduce new market uncertainties.

          <p>Scientists have made a remarkable discovery in Southeast Asia: smoke-dried human remains that may represent the world's oldest known mummies, potentially dating back up to 12,000 years. This finding could significantly predate the famous mummies of Egypt and Chile's Chinchorro people. Researchers observed specific cuts and burn marks on the remains, indicating that ancient hunter-gatherer communities likely preserved their dead by smoke-drying them over fires. This practice, still observed by some Indigenous communities today, is believed to have enabled enduring physical and spiritual connections with ancestors. The study offers a profound contribution to understanding prehistoric funerary practices and humanity's timeless desire to preserve and honor loved ones.</p>

Experts warn against complacency, advocating for workers to "pivot in place" by actively seeking internal advancements, acquiring new skill sets, and strategically expanding their professional networks.
