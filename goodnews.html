          <p>British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has entered into a landmark $12.5 billion deal with Chinese company Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals. The agreement grants GSK exclusive global rights, excluding Greater China, to develop a dozen drugs, including a promising treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This deal, involving a $500 million upfront payment and future milestone-based payments, highlights China's growing influence and research capabilities in the global biomedical industry. Hengrui stated the partnership will help expand the international market for its innovative medicines in areas like oncology and immunology.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has secured a $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to Tesla, a deal confirmed by CEO Elon Musk. The contract, effective until the end of 2033, was initially filed without naming the counterparty, citing trade secrets. Musk later posted on X that Samsung's new Texas facility will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, underscoring the strategic importance of the partnership. This agreement is a significant development for Samsung's foundry business as it competes with industry leader TSMC and aims to bolster its position in the AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After 74 years of scientific research and planning, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River downstream hydropower project in Tibet. The project was announced by Premier Li Qiang at a groundbreaking ceremony in the city of Nyingchi. This dam is set to be the world's most powerful, with a planned installed capacity of 60,000 megawatts, which is three times that of the Three Gorges Dam. The initiative's origins trace back to the first comprehensive scientific expedition to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1951, which laid the groundwork for this massive engineering and energy undertaking.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: US-EU Tariff Agreement Seen as Major Trump Victory, Though Not a Complete Loss for Brussels</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recently announced trade framework between the United States and the European Union is being framed as a significant win for the Trump administration. While the EU avoided the threatened 30% tariffs, the agreed-upon 15% rate is a major climbdown for Brussels and higher than the UK's 10% rate. In return, the EU is opening its markets to certain American exports at zero tariff and will purchase hundreds of billions in US energy and arms. The deal removes significant economic uncertainty for a sluggish European economy, a concession Brussels deemed worth the price, especially given its reliance on the US for security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material as part of 'Operation Grayskull.' The investigation, launched in 2020, has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or utilized the network, which had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. Among those convicted is William Spearman, labeled 'one of the most significant' purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence. The operation is being hailed by officials as one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's southern technology hub, have introduced new rules mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose state-funded projects fail. The policy applies to universities, hospitals, and companies, stating that individuals should not be punished or have their future funding prospects hindered if a project fails due to reasonable circumstances. Scenarios for exemption include unforeseen technical difficulties or market changes that render a product unviable. The move is designed to encourage researchers to 'boldly explore uncharted territories' and foster a culture that is more tolerant of the risks inherent in scientific and technological innovation.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the European Union and the United States has elicited varied responses from European leaders. While many expressed relief that a worse-case scenario was avoided, the agreed-upon 15% tariff rate was met with criticism. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) called the agreement an 'inadequate compromise,' while leaders from Italy and Ireland acknowledged it provides stability despite not being ideal. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof noted that while 'no tariffs would have been better,' the deal brings clarity and market stability. The reactions highlight a consensus that while a trade war was averted, the terms are still challenging for European exporters.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, imposing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods and heading off a wider conflict. The deal was announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a meeting in Scotland. As part of the agreement, the EU will significantly increase its investment in the US and its purchases of American energy products and military equipment. While the 15% tariff is a significant increase from pre-Trump levels, it is half of the 30% rate that had been threatened, bringing a measure of stability to the €1.4tn transatlantic trade relationship.</p>

          <p>A profile of John Oliver explores his path from the Edinburgh Fringe festival to becoming one of America's most influential comedians with his HBO show, 'Last Week Tonight.' Oliver explains that his comedy evolved from simply wanting laughs to making people laugh about substantive, often obscure political and social issues he cares about. The show's success is rooted in a meticulous research process, with a large staff of writers and former journalists ensuring every segment is factually sound before the comedy is layered on. Despite his critical lens, Oliver, now a US citizen married to an Army veteran, insists his critiques of America come from a place of love.</p>
