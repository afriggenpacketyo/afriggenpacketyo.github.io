          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a larger government effort to focus on disease prediction and prevention, with a ¬£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that this genetic technology will allow the health service to proactively address illnesses rather than react to them. The plan follows an earlier announcement of a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies, marking a significant step towards personalized healthcare.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. This ruling prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, suggesting the school has acted appropriately during negotiations. The Department of Homeland Security had previously accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the attempt to revoke its student visa system certification. The ruling allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students as the case proceeds.</p>
