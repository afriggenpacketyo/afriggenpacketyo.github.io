          <p>Caught between the US-China trade war, ASEAN has an opportunity to assert itself in global trade and geopolitics, potentially shaping a new regional order. With a new free-trade agreement with China and the possibility of a Trump tariff meeting, ASEAN can foster a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem. Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has requested a meeting with President Trump to discuss tariffs and ensure trade fairness for ASEAN's export-driven economies. Asean's unique position allows it to shape trade rules rather than merely adapt to them, requiring unprecedented cohesion. </p>
