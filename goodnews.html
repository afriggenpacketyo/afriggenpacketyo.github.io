          <p>AI startup Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged the company illegally used their copyrighted books to train its AI models. According to the court filing, the settlement includes payments of approximately $3,000 per book and requires Anthropic to destroy the datasets containing the pirated material. This case has been closely watched as a precedent for copyright infringement in the age of artificial intelligence. If approved, it would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was unlawful. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen prevents the administration from ending the legal protections and work permits for these individuals, barring a successful appeal. The judge's ruling stated that the Department of Homeland Security's action to revoke TPS was unprecedented in its speed and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. This provides temporary relief for the affected migrant communities facing potential deportation.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are remembering Giorgio Armani not just for his iconic designs but as a masterful business leader who built a global empire. Armani was praised for maintaining creative control and brand consistency by never selling his company, allowing him to expand into diverse markets like cosmetics, home furnishings, and even chocolates. His introduction of the softly tailored "power suit" for both men and women in the 1970s and 80s redefined professional attire. Furthermore, his strategy of dressing celebrities for films and red carpet events was a pioneering marketing move that elevated his brand's global prestige.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to $1.7 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per person annually on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 a year, which may be linked to fewer purchasing opportunities in rural areas. For some states, lottery sales represent a notable source of revenue, accounting for up to 3% of general funds in places like Rhode Island and South Dakota.</p>

          <p>An analysis of crime data in Chicago offers a nuanced picture that contrasts with President Trump's recent sharp criticisms of the city. According to FBI data from 2024, Chicago's violent crime rate was down 11% from the previous year and ranked 29th out of 37 large U.S. cities, lower than New York and Los Angeles. While the city recorded the highest total number of homicides, its homicide rate per 100,000 people placed it tenth among major cities. Experts caution against city-by-city rankings due to differing methodologies and geographical boundaries, suggesting that perception is often shaped by concentrated spikes in violence.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written exchange with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent ruling. Barrett explained that her direct response to Jackson's dissent on nationwide injunctions was a professional reaction to a "spirited argument" that she felt "merited a spirited response." She emphasized that their disagreements are confined to legal arguments and do not affect their personal or professional relationship as colleagues. Quoting her former mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett affirmed her approach is to "attack ideas... not attack people."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The eight largest U.S. tech companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion this week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. The surge was largely driven by a favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case, which imposed limited penalties and allowed its lucrative search deal with Apple to continue, boosting both companies' stocks. Another major gainer was Broadcom, whose shares rose after announcing a new $10 billion contract with a major AI client. This growth highlights the increasing market concentration, with these few megacap companies now accounting for approximately 36% of the S&P 500's total value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign, a landmark at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years, is being temporarily taken down. The removal is necessary to accommodate a major reconfiguration of the surrounding roadways aimed at improving traffic flow and accessibility. The project is part of a broader modernization effort to prepare the airport for major upcoming events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics.

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop represents the largest one-day decrease in over a year, providing some relief to prospective homebuyers facing high housing prices. For a buyer of a median-priced home, this rate reduction could translate to a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this decline will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as overall mortgage demand has remained sluggish.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to recast his government. The shake-up includes new appointments to two of the highest offices of state: Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. This move is seen as an attempt by Starmer to seize a moment of crisis and re-energize his administration, which has faced a challenging first year with declining approval ratings. For the first time, the top three cabinet positions below the Prime Minister are all held by women.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has dropped a proposed regulation that would have required airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, was never enacted and faced strong opposition from the airline industry, which argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider such "extra-statutory requirements" while still implementing consumer protections mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds. Airline industry groups praised the decision, supporting the Trump administration's deregulatory agenda.</p>
