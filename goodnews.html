          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the AI talent competition by hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees. The $2.4 billion deal involves licensing fees and compensation, though Google is not investing in Windsurf itself, which remains an independent entity. This acquisition underscores the intense rivalry among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft to secure top AI expertise, particularly in the burgeoning field of AI-assisted software development.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a backlash over sandals that resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted after Prada showcased the design at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, prompting criticism on social media. In response, Prada initiated talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to explore future collaborations. This move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting immigration raids that rely on unconstitutional tactics in several Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU, which argued that federal agents were violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by targeting individuals based on race or ethnicity. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims, enjoining agents from making stops based solely on factors like appearance, speaking Spanish, or location. This decision provides a temporary stop to controversial enforcement actions amid heightened community fear.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform without their consent. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The decision is considered a significant victory for artists seeking to protect their work from unauthorized use by AI companies.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing offices abroad, driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies expanding internationally. These firms find that Chinese businesses prefer their services, citing greater trust and understanding. As of last year, there were 208 Chinese law firm offices overseas, a 70% increase since 2018. While they are successfully serving Chinese clients, attracting non-Chinese clients remains a challenge amid rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for their global strategy.</p>

          <p>"The Night We Met," a song by the indie band Lord Huron, has achieved massive, unexpected success nearly a decade after its initial release in 2015.

Its popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" and subsequently went viral on TikTok. The song's slow-burning, enduring appeal is attributed to its relatable, wistful theme of a soured relationship, allowing it to connect with a vast audience.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted his first "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and campaigners to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony led by an Indigenous Earth Elder and focused on the interconnectedness of all life and the wisdom of pre-industrial cultures. The King's long-held belief system, which advocates for sustainable practices and rejects exploitative consumerism, was once seen as radical but is now gaining mainstream acceptance.

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. While Swiatek has more major-final experience, Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style and underdog status could make her particularly dangerous on the grass court. Analysts note that Swiatek has adapted her game for grass by moving further behind the baseline to better utilize her powerful topspin forehand. The key to victory will likely be who better manages the pressure of the occasion in their first-ever tour-level meeting.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a new foreign policy course, asserting a sovereign, "Australia first" doctrine amid rising global tensions between the U.S. and China. Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese is emphasizing that Australia must act in its own strategic interests rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While maintaining the U.S. alliance as a pillar of security, this recalibration involves pragmatic engagement with China, as demonstrated by his upcoming state visit to Beijing. The approach aims to find strength and opportunity in Australia's unique geopolitical position.</p>
