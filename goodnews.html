          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Details of Earliest Human Migration to the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 02:04:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, specifically from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct groups due to environmental isolation, completing the longest migration out of Africa. This work, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, offers new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines, while also confirming human presence in South America dating back at least 23,000 years.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is advocating for legislation to regulate AI companies' use of her likeness and voice. She recounts an instance where OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman allegedly created a chatbot voice similar to hers after she declined to voice it. Johansson's legal team intervened, leading OpenAI to remove the voice feature. She emphasizes the need for boundaries in AI to prevent exploitation and encourages other public figures to support such regulations. Johansson also took legal action against an AI image-generating app for using her voice and likeness in an advertisement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors moved away from U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts suggest that Trump's tariff shocks altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading to diversification into markets like Japan. Japanese assets are generally considered a safe haven, and their appeal increased as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground.</p>
