          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure from the law firm to start their own practice. This move follows criticism of Paul Weiss for reaching a deal with the Trump administration to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business. The deal, brokered by firm chairman Brad Karp, has been widely criticized by associates, lawyers, and Democrats, especially since Karp has been a major fundraiser for Democrats and previously opposed Trump. The departing partners did not directly address the deal in their announcement.</p>

          <p>Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, stated that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance following discussions with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa discussed trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington. The negotiators agreed on the need to conclude a trade deal as soon as possible, although securing major concessions for Japan appears unlikely. Akazawa also requested the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates, including concerts scheduled up to early July 2026, after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition, which has been exacerbated by recent performances, has led to problems with his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing while he undergoes physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. NPH is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting brain-related functions, but is usually treatable with a surgical procedure.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the use of hummingbird feeders in the western United States has changed the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks. The study, published in Global Change Biology, found that the beaks became longer and more slender, allowing them to access more nectar from the feeders. The range of the hummingbird also expanded northward, influenced by the increasing popularity of bird feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. The study highlights how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of organisms.</p>

The visit comes after an election won by Mark Carney on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment, and the King will balance a message of solidarity with Canada without jeopardizing the UK's relationship with the US.</p>
