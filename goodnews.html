          <h2>China Reveals 600km/h Maglev Train Prototype to Bridge Gap Between Rail and Air Travel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 06:30:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new magnetic levitation (maglev) train prototype capable of reaching speeds up to 600km/h (373mph), showcasing the nation's advanced rail transport ambitions. Developed by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), the train is designed to significantly reduce travel times between major cities, such as cutting the Beijing-Shanghai journey from 5.5 to just 2.5 hours. The project aims to fill the speed gap between conventional high-speed rail and aviation for distances under 2,000km. The train will undergo further testing before being considered for commercial service.</p>

          <p>Devout Muslim sisters Jamilah, Zaynah, and Latifah McBryde have successfully advocated for changes in American women's wrestling to accommodate their faith. Initially unable to compete in college due to uniform requirements, their perseverance, with support from coaches at Life University, led the NAIA to approve modest, full-body uniforms. Despite facing some controversy and being barred from Olympic contention by international rules, their efforts have inspired others and prompted USA Wrestling to amend its own regulations. The sisters continue to excel in the sport, viewing their impact on inclusivity as their greatest achievement.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, Live Aid is remembered as a monumental global music event that raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia and set a precedent for large-scale charity concerts. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, it united the world's biggest music stars and brought the issue of famine to the global political agenda. However, the event is now viewed through a more critical lens, facing criticism for its lack of African performers and reinforcement of a "white savior" narrative. Despite these flaws, its legacy includes inspiring significant debt cancellation for poor countries and demonstrating the power of collective action.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, who had been missing for nearly two weeks in the Australian outback, has been found alive. Her discovery by a passerby on a remote path follows a large-scale search operation that was concentrated near her abandoned van, which appeared to have mechanical issues. Wilga was last seen on June 29 in the town of Beacon, and her disappearance sparked concern after she lost regular contact with her family in Germany. The successful outcome concludes days of intensive searching by Western Australia Police in the vast and challenging terrain.</p>

          <p>Intel is spinning out its AI robotics and biometric technology venture into a new, independent company called RealSense, which has secured $50 million in a Series A funding round. The new company, which develops tools for robotics automation, plans to use the capital to create new product lines and meet growing global demand for physical AI. This move comes as Intel undergoes broader cost-cutting measures and as investment in the robotics space surges from tech giants like Tesla and Nvidia. Intel will retain a minority stake in RealSense, which was first created over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>A San Diego chef has filed a class-action lawsuit against foam foodware manufacturer WinCup, alleging the company continues to sell banned polystyrene products in California. The lawsuit comes after a state law, SB 54, which prohibited the sale of such items, went into effect on January 1 but has seen little enforcement from the state's recycling agency, CalRecycle. The plaintiff argues that WinCup is also deceptively labeling its products as recyclable, misleading consumers. This legal action highlights frustration over the state's inaction and aims to hold producers accountable for environmental laws.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Roger Hutson, a Denver businessman who actively worked against Donald Trump's election in both 2016 and 2024 but has since become a supporter. Hutson, a fiscally conservative and socially moderate former Republican, states that while he still dislikes Trump's personality, he is impressed by his policy achievements. He credits the president with securing the border, forcing allies to increase defense spending, and taking on unfair trade partners. Hutson's conversion illustrates that despite deep political polarization, some individuals remain open to changing their minds based on perceived performance and results.</p>

          <p>The touring production of "A Beautiful Noise," a jukebox musical about Neil Diamond, is praised for its powerful vocal performances and effective celebration of the artist's work. The show uses a therapy session framework, with an older Neil looking back on his life, to provide biographical context for his iconic songs. Nick Fradiani, playing the younger Neil, is highlighted for capturing the excitement and underlying melancholy of Diamond's singing. While the therapeutic framing can feel heavy-handed, the musical succeeds by keeping the focus on the beloved music, delivering an uplifting and nostalgic experience for fans.</p>

          <p>A review of Laurie Gwen Shapiro's new book, "The Aviator and the Showman," praises its vibrant account of the relationship between famed pilot Amelia Earhart and her husband, George Putnam. The book details how Putnam, a savvy publisher, masterfully crafted Earhart's public image and career, turning her into a mass-market icon. However, it also suggests his intrusive management and profit-driven motives, such as pressuring her to hasten her final journey for a radio deal, may have contributed to her tragic disappearance. The narrative is described as a layered look at early aviation, celebrity culture, and their intertwined ambitions.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Addresses Common Health Concerns Regarding Microwave Radiation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks the common fear that microwaves are harmful to your health or food, explaining that they use a safe form of non-ionizing radiation. Unlike ionizing radiation from nuclear reactions, the electromagnetic waves in a microwave do not have enough energy to damage DNA or make food radioactive. In fact, due to shorter cooking times, microwaving can be one of the best methods for preserving nutrients in food compared to other cooking techniques like boiling. The primary safety concerns are using microwave-safe containers to avoid chemical leaching from plastics and preventing common burns from hot food and dishes.</p>

          <p>In a major milestone for AI on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs is testing Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition. The bank plans to augment its human workforce with the AI agent, which can independently complete complex, multi-step coding assignments with minimal human intervention. According to Goldman's tech chief, the firm will initially deploy hundreds of these AI "employees" to handle tedious tasks, potentially boosting developer productivity significantly. This move signals a shift toward more powerful "agentic AI" and could foreshadow major changes in the roles and expectations for human workers in the financial industry.</p>
