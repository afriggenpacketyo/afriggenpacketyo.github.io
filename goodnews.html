          <p>President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House for a high-stakes meeting, aiming to advance peace negotiations for the ongoing war in Ukraine. This critical summit followed Trump's recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, highlighting the complex diplomatic landscape. Trump publicly urged Zelenskyy to "show flexibility" while warning Putin "to be good," suggesting a path where the two leaders meet first before a trilateral summit with Trump. Zelenskyy hailed the meeting as a "truly significant step" toward ending the war and securing Ukraine, with coordination on security guarantees already in progress.</p>

          <p>A conservative think tank, the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), has circulated a new roadmap of recommendations for Republicans' second legislative agenda under President Trump. The memo advises lawmakers to pursue further Medicaid and regulatory reforms, cut federal funding for government pensions and student loans, and use fiscal policy to advance conservative goals on abortion and transgender treatment. Building on Trump's initial "one big, beautiful bill," EPIC argues these continued reforms are essential for meaningful fiscal change and national financial resilience. These proposals, particularly Medicaid cuts, are expected to be highly contentious and politically fraught, drawing strong opposition from Democrats.</p>

          <p>A new Fidelity Investments study reveals that nearly two-thirds of investors remain confident in their portfolios despite recent market volatility, expecting stable or improved performance. However, seasoned investors, having navigated past market swings, show a more pessimistic outlook and lower risk tolerance. Certified financial planner Tim Maurer advises continuous "calibrating" of risk, emphasizing long-term, diversified investment strategies. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are highlighted for their growing popularity due to advantages like lower fees and intraday trading, though Maurer cautions that the ETF "wrapper" doesn't guarantee a great investment, urging due diligence.

          <p>China has officially confirmed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the country at the end of the month, marking his first trip to China in seven years. This highly anticipated visit raises expectations for a potential meeting between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. The announcement signifies a notable improvement in bilateral relations, which had significantly deteriorated following a deadly border clash in 2020. Both nations are now experiencing a warming of ties amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States, suggesting a shift in regional dynamics.</p>

Passengers reported seeing flames, though the airline clarified it was a "visible reaction at the rear of the engine" caused by an airflow disturbance. The flight crew successfully shut down the engine in a controlled manner, ensuring the safety of all 273 passengers and eight crew members, with no injuries reported. While some passengers faced an uncomfortable overnight stay at the airport due to limited hotel capacity, another aircraft was dispatched to complete their journey.</p>

          <p>Excel Dryer, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of electric hand dryers, has successfully achieved its long-standing goal of sourcing 100% of its parts domestically by 2023. This strategic shift, driven by a vision to reduce offshore business risks, was notably solidified by the implementation of President Trump's China tariffs. The company faced an eight-year challenge in finding a non-Chinese motor supplier to complete its domestic supply chain. This accomplishment demonstrates a growing trend among some U.S. firms to prioritize American-made components, effectively navigating international trade policies and strengthening domestic manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Air Canada flights are set to gradually resume after the airline reached a tentative agreement with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), ending a four-day strike by 10,000 flight attendants. The dispute, which grounded flights and affected hundreds of thousands of passengers, centered on pay and scheduling, including compensation for unpaid ground work. The union hailed the deal as achieving "transformational change" and advised members to cooperate with the resumption of operations. Full service restoration may take several days as aircraft and crew reposition.</p>

Bessent reiterated the administration's desire for easing monetary policy, stating it would significantly benefit the struggling U.S. housing market.

          <p>Rudi Gernreich, an Austrian-born visionary designer, created the thong bathing suit in 1974 as a bold act of rebellion against a nudity ban on Los Angeles beaches. Gernreich, a pioneer of body positivity and a co-founder of one of the first LGBTQ+ rights organizations in the U.S., aimed to liberate the body and challenge sexual hang-ups, not to sexualize nudity. His groundbreaking designs, including the controversial monokini in 1964, consistently pushed societal boundaries and promoted unisex fashion. Gernreich's enduring legacy highlights his ahead-of-his-time vision for fashion that embraced natural forms and championed individual freedom, remaining relevant in contemporary discussions about modesty and censorship.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reportedly backed down from its contentious demand for Apple to provide "backdoor" access to encrypted U.S. customer data, according to a statement from U.S. spy chief Tulsi Gabbard. This significant development follows months of dispute, during which the U.S. administration, including President Trump, strongly criticized the UK's request under the Investigatory Powers Act as an infringement on civil liberties. Apple had previously responded by uniquely withdrawing advanced data protection options for new British customers. While the Home Office has not confirmed the report, this outcome suggests a potential resolution to a high-profile international disagreement concerning data privacy and government surveillance.</p>

This ambitious plan aligns with a recent shift by the United States to classify drones as consumables, thereby accelerating procurement processes. The substantial acquisition, detailed in a tender notice, encompasses five distinct categories of drones, ranging from small multi-rotor platforms with short endurance to fixed-wing systems capable of longer flights and heavier payloads. This strategic investment underscores Taiwan's proactive approach to strengthening its military defenses amidst escalating regional tensions and the evolving nature of modern warfare.</p>

Marketing experts highlight its visual suitability for platforms like TikTok, where the elaborate preparation ritual is extensively documented. While traditional Japanese tea ceremonies are communal, the current Western trend emphasizes personal self-improvement, reflecting a broader cultural phenomenon of online-driven consumerism and a search for "consensus reality" amidst increasing isolation.</p>

While the initial segment is described as somewhat chaotic, the film significantly improves, particularly during its "bravura" ransom exchange sequence set amidst vibrant New York City scenes. The movie delves into anti-capitalist themes, with the kidnapper embodying societal anger, ultimately offering a compelling narrative about finding purpose beyond comfortable environs.</p>
