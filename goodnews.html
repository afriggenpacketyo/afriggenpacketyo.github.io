Trump stated the U.S. would receive 55% tariffs, while China would be subject to 10% tariffs, also noting that China will supply necessary rare earths upfront. Chinese state media reported that both countries had agreed to a trade "framework" during talks in London, following previous discussions in Geneva and a phone call between the two leaders.

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News discusses the unexpected reconciliation between President Trump and Elon Musk, arguing that their collaboration is crucial for America's competitiveness in the global technology race. The author suggests that while their feud may have caused market jitters, their renewed partnership could be a secret weapon against China's growing dominance in industries like electric vehicles, battery technology, and artificial intelligence. Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, are highlighted as key drivers of American innovation, and Trump's policies could help facilitate their success. The author emphasizes that America's strength lies in bottom-up ingenuity, and the partnership between Trump and Musk could be essential for maintaining a competitive edge.</p>

Magull stated that sporting and personal reasons contributed to her depression, which reached a critical point after Germany's disappointing performance at the 2023 World Cup and changes in her club career. She spent six weeks in therapy, rediscovering her passion for football and life, and emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help for mental health issues.

          <p>A new study suggests that AI art cannot match human creativity because generative AI models struggle to represent sensory experiences. Researchers found that Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the ability to understand concepts like a flower in the same way humans do, due to the absence of sensory and motor components. The study indicates that AI's creativity is "hollow and shallow" because it cannot replicate the richness of human sensory experiences. While AI can produce outputs that meet minimal definitions of creativity, they lack the depth and emotional connection found in human-created art.</p>

          <p>The European Union is evaluating whether the surge in Chinese exports to the bloc is a result of the high US tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially prompting emergency measures. This assessment comes after a significant drop in Chinese shipments to the United States in May, coinciding with a rise in exports to EU countries like France and Germany. Despite the trade spikes, the European Commission states that it's too early to definitively conclude that trade diversion is occurring. The EU is using a new customs surveillance system to monitor trade flows and determine if any harm is being caused to EU industries.</p>

Trump had previously responded by threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX.

          <p>Premiership Rugby is intensifying its efforts to prevent financial cheating through enhanced monitoring and data analysis. Copies of player contracts and related financial arrangements are sent to salary cap manager Andrew Rogers, who audits club accounts and interviews officials and players to detect inconsistencies. The league is extending investigations to include data from players' and officials' phones, searching for undeclared payments. Rogers also assesses whether contracts align with market rates based on player age, position, and experience. The league emphasizes communication, support, and education to ensure compliance with regulations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a trade deal with China "is done," but provided limited details about the agreement. The deal is said to be a "framework" meant to solidify terms reached in Geneva last month. The lack of specifics raises questions about the extent and impact of the agreement. The announcement follows two days of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, but further information is needed to assess the deal's implications for both economies. (not investment advice)</p>
