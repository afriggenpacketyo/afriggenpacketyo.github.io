          <p>Elon Musk announced his departure from his role as a Special Government Employee in the Trump administration, marking the end of his 130-day mandate focused on reducing wasteful spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk expressed gratitude to President Trump for the opportunity and affirmed that the DOGE mission would continue to strengthen within the government. His exit follows criticism of Trump's budget bill, which Musk believes undermines DOGE's efforts, and coincides with a period of declining sales at his electric car company. Musk's role had involved cutting federal jobs, sometimes leading to controversies and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever suffered their worst loss of the WNBA season, 83-77 against the Washington Mystics, in the first game Caitlin Clark missed due to a quad injury. The Fever started strong but were outscored by the Mystics for much of the game, highlighting Clark's importance to the team. The Fever's point differential was significantly lower without Clark, and their 77 points were the lowest they've scored all season. Clark is expected to miss at least two weeks, leaving the Fever to adjust their strategy in her absence.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, fueled by demand for AI chips. The company's stock rose in extended trading, despite a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry due to these restrictions. The company's gaming and automotive divisions also reported significant sales growth, and Nvidia spent billions on share repurchases during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy" economics, likening him to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Reform's policies, particularly unfunded tax cuts, would lead to an economic meltdown and increased mortgage costs. Reform UK has gained traction in recent local elections, posing a challenge to the traditional main parties in Britain. Starmer's speech underscores the growing political rivalry between Labour and Reform, with the prime minister positioning himself as a defender of economic stability against what he views as reckless fiscal policies.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. Ryosei Akazawa, a close aide to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, indicated that such purchases could be considered within the scope of trade negotiations. However, Akazawa also emphasized that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different principles and should not be directly mixed in talks. Japan hopes to schedule a summit between Ishiba and President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.</p>

          <p>The government has fast-tracked two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire in a bid to shore up England's water supplies. These projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to speed through the planning process, though they could still be more than a decade away from opening. The move is intended to address rising temperatures, a growing population, and increased demand, but some experts warn that managing water usage needs greater precedence. Local objections and the cost of building the reservoirs remain significant challenges.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from the south of Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes that they might nest. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juveniles and sub-adults from the Scottish Highlands. These birds have been sighted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, and the Lake District, signaling a potentially exciting milestone for the species' recovery. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution.</p>
