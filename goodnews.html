          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte stated that President Trump's upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska will be a critical test of Putin's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Rutte expressed that while Ukraine must ultimately be involved in negotiations about its future, this initial summit is a crucial step to gauge Russia's willingness to engage in a peace process. He praised Trump's strategy of applying pressure through sanctions and weapons deliveries to Ukraine, which he believes has created the conditions for this dialogue. The meeting is seen as a pivotal moment that could either stall or advance diplomatic efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's stock recently experienced its best weekly advance in over five years, a rally attributed not to fundamentals but to a significant "short squeeze." Investors had bet against the company, citing its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial hits from antitrust rulings and tariffs. However, when President Trump signaled that Apple would be exempt from certain tariffs after the company pledged further U.S. investment, the stock price rose, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares and further driving up the price. This dazzling run masked negative trends in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who died at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," praised him as a leader who dared to dream and lead others to extraordinary places. The film depicted the perilous 1970 lunar mission where an explosion crippled the spacecraft, forcing Lovell and his crew to abort their moon landing and execute a daring return to Earth. Hanks remembered Lovell's voyages as being fueled by challenge, not fame, and wished him well on his "next voyage" to the cosmos.</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of 'forest bathing,' or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a method for improving mental health and focus. The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the environment. Experts and practitioners say that by slowing down and disconnecting from technology, forest bathing can significantly lower stress levels and provide a powerful contrast to modern, fast-paced lifestyles. The practice can be done on dedicated trails with a guide or simply by spending quiet, reflective time in a local park or backyard.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that developing a strong personal brand is crucial for introverts to advance in the workplace. She defines a personal brand as what people know you for, which can be shaped to highlight talents that might otherwise be overlooked. Chan suggests that introverts can start with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build visibility without feeling overwhelmed. She emphasizes that branding isn't just online; participating in hobby groups and social events also helps shape the story others tell about you.</p>

          <p>A new biography of novelist Muriel Spark prompts a re-examination of her work, highlighting that beyond her reputation as a comic writer, she was one of modern Britain's most important religious authors. A Catholic convert, Spark's fiction was deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job, and explored themes of divine will, suffering, and judgment. This article argues that she conveyed her theology through narrative form, often playing God with her characters by using literary devices like prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early on. This technique forced readers to focus not on what happens, but on why.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising individuals with high blood pressure to avoid taking licorice root supplements. The herb contains a substance called glycyrrhizin, which can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance puts additional strain on the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including arrhythmias. The FDA has previously warned that consuming even two ounces of black licorice daily for two weeks can cause significant cardiovascular issues. Instead of supplements, doctors recommend proven lifestyle changes like the DASH or Mediterranean diets.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple, Jason and Katie Lee, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move with their young son to Taipei, Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical. The primary motivation was to allow their son to spend extended, quality time with his paternal grandparents. By planning carefully, they minimized their U.S. expenses, renting out their house to cover their mortgage. The career break has been transformative, allowing them to focus on health, family, and re-evaluating their career priorities, realizing they can be happier with less income and more flexibility.</p>
