          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit signals a potential thaw in relations, driven by shared economic challenges like U.S. tariffs. Despite recent gestures such as resuming direct flights, deep-seated issues including border disputes, a significant trade deficit favoring China, and Beijing's military support for Pakistan remain major obstacles. Experts are skeptical of a long-term strategic partnership but acknowledge the meeting could establish common ground on economic cooperation, particularly given India's reliance on Chinese components for key industries. The summit will be a key indicator of the future trajectory of this complex relationship.</p>

This development is significant as the U.S. attempts to limit China's access to cutting-edge chip technology. Luo founded the company in 2015, focusing on gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a next-generation semiconductor material. Her company achieved a major breakthrough by becoming the first to mass-produce 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, placing China in a leading position in this specific semiconductor sector.</p>

Notably, Affirm reported a net income of $69.2 million, a significant turnaround from a net loss in the same quarter last year, achieving its goal of operating income profitability.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained the decision to trade star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be a better team." Jones emphasized that acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark addresses the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. He also highlighted the acquisition of two future first-round draft picks as valuable assets for building long-term success. The trade followed stalled contract negotiations, though Jones maintained there were no hard feelings and that he had made a substantial offer to Parsons.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed, diverging from the positive performance seen on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes both declined as investors reacted to new economic data, including a slowdown in Tokyo's core consumer price inflation, which nevertheless remained above the central bank's target. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both posted modest gains. The varied performance reflects regional investors weighing local economic indicators alongside global market trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientists Study DNA of 800-Year-Old Oak Tree to Unlock Secrets of Longevity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 20:10:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying the DNA of ancient oak trees in the UK, some up to 800 years old, to understand their remarkable resilience to disease, climate change, and other threats. The project, involving The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to identify specific genes responsible for their longevity and hardiness. This genetic information could be crucial for selecting the best oak trees to plant in the future, aiding in the restoration of Britain's woodlands. Ancient oaks are vital "keystone species," supporting thousands of other forms of wildlife, and their preservation is critical for biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost. Health officials hope the program will not only prevent severe complications from the virus but also reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children, estimated to cost £24 million annually.</p>

He believes the full potential of AI has yet to be realized across various business sectors, which will drive future demand for Nvidia's technology.
