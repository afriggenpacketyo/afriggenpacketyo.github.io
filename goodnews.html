          <h2>Netflix Shares Decline After Earnings Miss Due to Brazilian Tax Issue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 11:29:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares experienced a drop following a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily attributed to an ongoing tax dispute in Brazil. The dispute involves a 10% tax on specific payments from Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, an expense not previously factored into Netflix's forecast. Despite this setback, Netflix reported a 17% increase in revenue, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. The company anticipates continued revenue growth in the fourth quarter and is expanding its consumer reach through partnerships with toy companies for its animated film "KPop Demon Hunters." The company is also exploring opportunities in live experiences, publishing, beauty, lifestyle, and food and beverages related to the film, aiming for further growth. The optimism score for this article is 65.</p>
