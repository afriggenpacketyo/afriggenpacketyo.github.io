          <p>Home price increases are slowing more than expected due to rising supply and slowing demand. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index reported a 2.7% annual increase in April, down from 3.4% in March, marking the smallest gain in nearly two years. The deceleration is taking hold across various cities, with some previously hot markets now experiencing price declines. Higher mortgage rates are pricing out potential buyers, while the supply of homes for sale is rising, but still below pre-pandemic levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protesters in Venice are claiming victory after Jeff Bezos changed his wedding venue, moving the main celebration to another location. Activists are protesting over-tourism in Venice, climate change, and Bezos' support for Donald Trump. Protesters put posters up across the city in recent days, and protest banners were strung from bridges over the canals.

          <p>The US has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, but experts are worried that budget cuts will undermine its potential to reduce infections. The US was a significant funder of global HIV initiatives until Trump's second term. Experts say cuts to domestic health institutions and foreign aid could jeopardize efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US by 2030. Lenacapavir, a highly promising preventative drug, provides six months of protection against HIV infection and was named Science's breakthrough of the year in 2024.</p>
