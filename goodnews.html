          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decline in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, murders fell by 14.9% and motor vehicle thefts saw a record 18.6% one-year drop. While hate crimes saw a slight overall decrease, the report does not provide a detailed breakdown of targets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has established a $1 million 'compassion fund' to assist students and families affected by federal immigration enforcement actions. Announced by Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, the fund aims to provide support for legal aid, transportation, and other urgent needs for families, including district employees who lack citizenship but are working legally. The initiative comes as the district prepares for the new school year amid heightened anxiety in immigrant communities, which has led some parents to keep their children home. The fund seeks to ensure school remains a safe and stable environment for all students.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, met with President Trump to discuss key issues affecting her state, highlighting a continuing bipartisan working relationship. During the meeting, Whitmer raised concerns about the negative impact of the administration's tariffs on Michigan's auto industry. She also requested a three-year delay for changes to the state's Medicaid program to avoid disrupting care for seniors and other vulnerable residents. Whitmer has defended her engagement with the White House, stating it has helped secure federal investments and support for Michigan, such as a new fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released two new open-weight artificial intelligence models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, marking its first such release since 2019. These models are designed as lower-cost, more accessible alternatives for developers and researchers to customize and run on a variety of hardware, from personal laptops to cloud servers. By making the model weights publicly available, OpenAI is contributing to the open-source AI ecosystem, joining competitors like Meta and Mistral. The company stated it conducted extensive safety testing to mitigate risks of malicious use before the highly anticipated release.</p>

          <p>This article examines why weather forecasts can be inaccurate despite significant technological advancements. It explains that the atmosphere is a 'chaotic system,' where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, a concept known as the Butterfly Effect. Communicating complex meteorological data in a simple format also presents a major challenge. The piece discusses the future of forecasting, including the transformative potential of AI models like Cambridge University's Aardvark Weather, which can predict weather with greater accuracy and speed. Ultimately, forecasters aim to provide more impact-based predictions, explaining what the weather will mean for people's daily lives.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion retailer Zara, ruling they were 'irresponsible' for featuring models who appeared 'unhealthily thin.' The watchdog noted that lighting and posing made one model look 'gaunt,' while another image emphasized 'protruding' collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next, reflecting a growing regulatory focus on promoting healthy body images in advertising.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that while the national housing market remains tight, home prices are beginning to fall in certain regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops from their 2022 peaks, driven by rising inventory and a boom in new construction. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited housing supply, with cities like Milwaukee seeing a 26% price increase since 2022. This regional divergence is creating very different experiences for homebuyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. While the company's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, its adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents missed the 49-cent forecast. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, noted that AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions on sales to China. Despite this, the company saw strong growth in its data center and client computing segments and remains a key competitor to Nvidia in the growing market for AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is making a significant push to reduce its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for everything from electronics to military technology. A key part of this strategy is the revival of California's Mountain Pass mine, a site that once dominated global production but has faced shutdowns and bankruptcy. The Department of Defense is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to re-establish a domestic supply chain, an urgent priority for the Trump administration. This effort reflects a broader geopolitical struggle as the U.S. works to secure its own sources of these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations aimed at making it easier for companies to use drones for commercial purposes, such as deliveries and inspections. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the proposal, which would streamline the approval process for businesses to operate drones beyond the pilot's line of sight. Under the new rules, commercial drones would need to meet specific safety standards, including having collision avoidance technology, and would be restricted from flying over large crowds. The move is intended to spur innovation and help the U.S. catch up with other countries in the deployment of commercial drone technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During an earnings call, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson criticized AI companies for the 'blatant theft' of intellectual property, using an unexpected example to make his point. He noted the irony that even President Trump, whose books like 'The Art of the Deal' are being consumed by AI engines without compensation, is a victim of this practice, turning 'The Art of the Deal' into 'The Art of the Steal.' Thomson affirmed that News Corp will continue its 'woo-and-sue' strategy, seeking both partnerships and legal action to protect the intellectual property of its journalists and authors from being used to train AI models without payment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from redirecting funds from the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states, which argued that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could not cancel the multibillion-dollar grant program without congressional approval. The BRIC program helps communities protect critical infrastructure against natural disasters. The judge ruled that the states showed a realistic chance of irreparable harm if the program, designed to save lives, were to be ended.</p>
