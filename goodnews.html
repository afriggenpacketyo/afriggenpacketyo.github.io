          <p>The first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas is set to begin with a hostage and prisoner exchange, accompanied by a ceasefire and increased aid to Gaza. The agreement also includes a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops, which will be monitored by a multinational force. Subsequent phases aim for a demilitarized Gaza governed by a reformed Palestinian Authority but face significant hurdles, including Hamas's refusal to disarm. The plan's long-term success remains uncertain due to these major points of contention between the involved parties.</p>

          <p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty expressed confidence in the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan, confirming Egypt's commitment to regional stability. He detailed Egypt's role in training Palestinian security forces and its willingness to contribute troops to an international peacekeeping force, pending a UN Security Council mandate. Abdelatty emphasized that the ultimate goal is the realization of a Palestinian state, viewing it as essential for long-term peace. Egypt is also co-organizing an international conference to fund the extensive reconstruction of Gaza's devastated infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a game dominated by the Broncos' defense, which held the Jets to just 82 total yards of offense. New York's quarterback, Justin Fields, was sacked nine times and the offense generated negative passing yards. A first-quarter touchdown pass from Broncos quarterback Bo Nix to Nate Adkins proved to be the decisive score. The victory improves the Broncos' season record to 4-2, while the Jets remain winless at 0-6.</p>

          <p>A CBS News report highlights the unconventional influence of real estate developers, including Jared Kushner, in shaping President Trump's Gaza peace plan. This approach signifies a non-traditional method of foreign policy, where business and development interests played a significant role in diplomatic negotiations. The strategy aimed to leverage economic incentives and reconstruction possibilities as key components to broker a ceasefire and a long-term agreement. This perspective offers insight into the unique blend of commerce and diplomacy that characterized the deal's formation.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul announced Germany's readiness to provide immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza and co-host a reconstruction conference with Egypt. He stressed the importance of a politically broad conference that includes Israel and establishes a political framework leading to a two-state solution, backed by a United Nations mandate. Despite support from Germany's ruling coalition, the initiative faces challenges, including criticism from Israeli officials who deemed a related Paris meeting "harmful." Germany's role in the U.S.-led peace plan remains to be clearly defined.</p>

          <p>Personal finance author Ramit Sethi provides four key investing tips for individuals earning a low income, such as $25,000 per year. He advises first building an emergency fund with three to six months of essential expenses to create financial stability. Sethi then recommends following a "conscious spending plan" that allocates funds to fixed costs, savings, investments, and guilt-free spending. He emphasizes the power of starting to invest early, even with small amounts, to leverage compound interest, and stresses the importance of actively seeking ways to boost income through new skills or side gigs.

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White, known for his award-winning role in "The Bear," is taking on the challenge of playing Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's 1982 album "Nebraska," a period when the musician was reportedly at a personal low point. White delved deep into the role, studying Springsteen's emotional complexity and the feeling of being an "observer in his own life," a sentiment the actor found relatable. He emphasized capturing the exhaustion and depth of Springsteen's performances rather than attempting to please everyone's preconceived notions of the rock legend.</p>

          <p>Brooke Cooper, 33, has been named the general manager of the Worcester Red Sox, a Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, making her the first woman to hold such a position in the franchise's history. Her journey began with a rejection for a team internship, but she persisted, securing the role two years later while pursuing her MBA. Cooper steadily climbed the ranks from merchandising intern to various executive positions, playing a key role in the team's marketing and operations.

          <h2>Child Development Study Identifies Seven Parenting Habits That Undermine Mental Strength in Children</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships identifies seven common habits that can lead to mentally weak children. These include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection instead of showing how to repair mistakes, and silencing big emotions rather than teaching regulation. The article also warns against prizing achievement over effort, hoarding all decision-making power, and making children responsible for parental emotions. To raise mentally strong kids, parents are advised to let children face age-appropriate challenges, validate feelings, take responsibility for their own actions, and model self-care.</p>
