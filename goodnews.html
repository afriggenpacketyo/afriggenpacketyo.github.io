          <p>Facing US tariffs, Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are increasing their overseas expansion to ensure long-term survival. Despite a temporary truce in the US-China tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US still face high tariffs due to alleged unfair trade practices. Companies like Trina Solar are localizing production abroad, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion. Executives note that exports would become impossible if tariffs rise significantly, highlighting the necessity of overseas production for continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for myeloma, a blood cancer, which delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells. This therapy, known as belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt the cancer for nearly three times longer than current treatments, reducing side effects. The drug works by binding a chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, releasing its toxic payload inside the cancerous cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness, and around 1,500 patients a year could benefit from this treatment.</p>

          <p>Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, has launched a push to lower rice prices in Japan, reminiscent of his father's reformist approach.
