          <p>Following recent trade talks, the United States and China have agreed to reduce tariff rates, lowering duties from triple-digit figures. Chinese goods entering the US will face at least 30% tariffs, while American exports to China will encounter a minimum of 10% in duties. However, these rates do not account for previous tariffs from earlier trade disputes or duties on specific goods. Financial institutions estimate the baseline tariff rate for Chinese exporters to be about 50%, combining older tariffs and the new duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, initially challenged by interest rate hikes in 2022, saw profits increase as higher rates boosted net interest income. Companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo experienced significant profit growth in 2024 due to this. However, as interest rates decline, these fintechs, especially digital banks, face a test to sustain profitability. Diversifying revenue streams and strong monetization of customer bases through non-interest services will be crucial for weathering economic changes and the transition to a lower-rate environment.

While acknowledging issues such as the death penalty and limited political dissent, Ratney suggests that Saudi Arabia's success is in America's interest and recommends easing export restrictions on advanced technologies and defense systems to foster stronger ties.

          <p>Temporary tariff cuts between the U.S. and China provide a crucial window for ensuring Christmas product supplies. With nearly a fifth of U.S. retail sales occurring during the Christmas season, the 90-day tariff pause can help resolve potential product shortages. While some businesses had halted production due to tariff increases, the reprieve allows for resumed orders and manufacturing. However, previously imposed tariffs remain in place, leading to an estimated weighted average tariff rate of 43.5% on Chinese products. Some companies have had to slightly raise prices to offset the remaining tariff impact. (not investment advice)</p>

Ley intends to review all policies, including the party's stance on nuclear power and net-zero emissions, and has pledged a fresh, collaborative approach.

If confirmed, this underground layer could hold a significant amount of water, potentially matching Mars' missing water.
