          <p>During her Las Vegas Studio Sessions residency, Kelly Clarkson delighted fans by bringing her 11-year-old daughter, River Rose, onto the stage to perform "Heartbeat Song." This marks River Rose's second time joining her mother for a duet in Las Vegas, showcasing the family's musical talent. The article also notes Clarkson's earlier decision to postpone the residency's start due to vocal strain, and a previous public performance by her 8-year-old son, Remington, singing Frank Sinatra. The event highlights a sweet, family-oriented moment in the singer's career, emphasizing her children's comfort in the spotlight.</p>

          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens achieved his first-ever Tour de France stage victory, triumphing on Stage 15 with a decisive breakaway win. The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider, who typically supports race leader Tadej Pogacar, capitalized on an opportunity during the final climb of the 169.3km route from Muret to Carcassonne. Wellens finished one minute and 28 seconds ahead of the second-place rider, marking the fifth stage win for his team in this year's race.

          <h2>UK Pledges to Halve Water Company Sewage Discharges by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 11:26:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has committed to halving sewage discharges by water companies by 2030, a pledge made amid public outrage and a record increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, as reported by the Environment Agency. Reed criticized the current regulator, Ofwat, for "clearly failing" and indicated that significant regulatory changes are necessary, though he dismissed the idea of nationalizing water companies due to prohibitive costs. The government plans a record £104 billion investment over the next five years to upgrade infrastructure, which is projected to increase consumer bills. The initiative also includes enhanced enforcement by the Environment Agency to penalize breaches.</p>

          <h2>David Litt Advocates for Finding "Neutral Ground" to Bridge Political Divides</h2>

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt, in his new book "It's Only Drowning," discusses the importance of finding "neutral ground" to foster connection and dialogue across political divides. He illustrates this concept with his personal experience of learning to surf with his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan superfan, despite their stark political and lifestyle differences. Litt argues that while "common ground" may be hard to find, engaging in shared activities can create spaces where people can spend time together focused on something other than their disagreements. This approach, he suggests, allows for genuine friendship and more meaningful discussions, embodying the principle of "disagreeing without being disagreeable."</p>

          <p>Child psychologist Reem Raouda advocates for "self-connection"—the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice—as the most crucial skill parents can teach their children for lifelong success. She explains how subtle, well-meaning parental interactions can inadvertently undermine this vital skill, potentially leading to anxiety, insecurity, or emotional shutdown. Raouda emphasizes that strong self-connection fosters emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, builds authentic confidence, and safeguards mental health. The article offers actionable advice for parents, such as validating emotions, embracing children's complete selves, avoiding micromanagement, modeling self-connection, and employing language that promotes awareness rather than shame.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are anticipated to hold a meeting either ahead of or during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea this year. This potential high-level engagement follows a recent face-to-face meeting between their foreign ministers, indicating a move towards stabilizing the often-fluctuating US-China relations. Despite President Trump's earlier threats of substantial tariffs on Chinese imports upon his return to the White House, both nations have since worked to ease tensions, reaching a preliminary trade agreement. This prospective summit is viewed as a significant step in managing the intricate dynamics between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Gene Marks contends that the conventional methods for measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job growth and unemployment rates, are increasingly outdated given contemporary workforce dynamics. He points to the emergence of the "over-employed"—individuals holding multiple jobs, often remotely—and the significant increase in new business applications as evidence of a more complex economic landscape. Marks advocates for a paradigm shift, suggesting that the focus should move from counting "jobs" to measuring total income, drawing data from comprehensive sources like tax returns and various private platforms.

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured in 1721 by the infamous pirate Olivier Levasseur, also known as La Buse. Found off the island of Nosy Boraha, the ship was reportedly carrying an immense treasure of gold, silver, pearls, and diamonds, estimated at $138 million today. While painstaking salvage work over 16 years has yielded thousands of artifacts, La Buse's fabled main treasure, linked to a cryptic message he purportedly issued before his execution, continues to elude discovery. This identification marks a significant advancement in unraveling a 300-year-old pirate mystery.</p>
