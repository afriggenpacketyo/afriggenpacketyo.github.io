          <p>This article discusses the controversy surrounding baby food pouches and the guilt mothers face regarding ultra-processed foods. The author argues that the criticism of pouches is part of a broader trend of shaming mothers for convenience and not adhering to traditional domestic roles. She contends that while dietary issues are important, the focus on pouches ignores the social, political, and economic factors that influence food choices.

          <p>Wealthy mainland Chinese are increasingly shifting their real estate investments away from the US to markets like Thailand, Australia, and Canada due to rising geopolitical tensions. Chinese buyers' demand for homes costing over US$5 million has decreased in the US, while increasing in other countries. Geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals are cited as reasons for the shift.
