          <p>An impact assessment on assisted dying in England and Wales estimates that the number of assisted deaths could exceed 4,000 in the tenth year after the law is enacted, though this would still represent less than 1% of all deaths. The assessment, carried out by civil servants, projects initial savings for the NHS ranging from ¬£919,000 to ¬£10.3m in the first six months, growing to between ¬£5.84m and ¬£59.6m after ten years. However, the assessment also anticipates significant costs, including over ¬£10m annually for staffing and over ¬£11m for initial training, with each case involving approximately 32 hours of work by six health professionals. The article details the debate surrounding the bill, with supporters emphasizing patient choice and compassion and opponents raising concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections as Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a revitalized opposition. The election is a gauge of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity, which has ruled since 1965, and of Wong's leadership. Singapore faces potential economic challenges due to US tariffs on its exports and broader global trade tensions. Voters are also concerned about the rising cost of living and housing availability, with the opposition arguing that the government hasn't done enough to address these issues. The article highlights the balance Singapore must strike between economic stability and addressing domestic concerns.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various venomous snakes, potentially leading to a universal antivenom. Current antivenoms must match the specific snake species, but Friede's 18-year mission could save lives and prevent disabilities from snakebites. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target neurotoxins common in deadly snakes, offering hope for a more effective treatment.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to weaken the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing significant administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power under the Communist Party. These reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. The government plans to reduce the number of provinces and municipalities and streamline governance. While officials say the changes will enhance efficiency and economic resilience, analysts suggest they also serve to centralize power and address dysfunction caused by anti-corruption efforts.
