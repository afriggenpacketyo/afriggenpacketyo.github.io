          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches, particularly those by SpaceX, to understand the sounds of spaceflight and their impact on communities. As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise generated, including sonic booms, is causing disruptions. Researchers are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters create a three-part sonic boom and how atmospheric conditions affect sound propagation. The goal is to gather data to mitigate noise pollution before it becomes a widespread problem, especially with the advent of larger and louder rockets like Starship.</p>

The current push for electric vehicles faces similar challenges, including political opposition and infrastructure limitations. The Trump administration is working to undercut electric vehicle growth, impose new taxes, and favor oil and gasoline. Despite these challenges, technical advancements and growing global demand may pave the way for electric vehicles to ultimately triumph. </p>
