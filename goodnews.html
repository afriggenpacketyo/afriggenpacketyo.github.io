          <p>At an informal meeting in Copenhagen, European Union foreign ministers brainstormed new measures to support Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. Key ideas discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and a Danish initiative to host Ukrainian arms production on EU soil to create a 'safe haven' from Russian attacks. Additionally, ministers debated the controversial seizure of frozen Russian central bank assets and a proposal to move the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops into Ukraine itself.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, representing a significant victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>One of the world's most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the Southern California coast by removing nearly six million voracious purple sea urchins. Over the past decade, divers led by the Bay Foundation have cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the giant kelp forests to regrow rapidly. This comeback has restored critical habitat for hundreds of marine species, improved water quality, and demonstrated a scalable model for combating ecosystem collapse caused by ecological imbalances.</p>

          <p>Germany is ending a freeze on its program to admit vulnerable Afghans, many of whom fled to Pakistan after the 2021 Taliban takeover and have been waiting for German visas. These individuals, who had worked for international organizations, now face the constant threat of arrest and deportation back to Afghanistan as Pakistan's one-month pause on deportations expires. Following pressure from human rights groups and German court rulings, the German government has resumed processing applications, with the first families expected to arrive in the coming days.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion, the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While nine tickets nationwide matched the five white balls to win $1 million each, the grand prize has continued to grow since it was last won in May. The next drawing on Monday night offers a winner the choice between the full annuity paid over 30 years or a lump sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>Slovenian basketball superstar Luka Dončić recorded only the fourth triple-double in EuroBasket history since 1995, leading his team to an 86-69 victory over Belgium. The Dallas Mavericks player scored 26 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and provided 11 assists, securing Slovenia's first win in this year's tournament. This historic performance was crucial for Slovenia's chances to advance to the knockout stage, following earlier losses despite Dončić's high-scoring efforts. Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from rest to score 27 points for undefeated Greece.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at an incident-filled Dutch Grand Prix, extending his championship lead. His teammate, Lando Norris, was on track for a comfortable second place before a dramatic engine failure forced him to retire with just seven laps remaining. The retirement is a significant blow to Norris's title hopes, widening the points gap to Piastri. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar claimed a remarkable first-ever podium finish in third.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta discusses innovative approaches to understanding and treating chronic pain, which affects millions. He highlights "reverse translational research," a method that starts with a patient's real-world experience and works backward to identify objective biomarkers for their subjective pain. This has led to groundbreaking trials using implanted brain electrodes to map, predict, and even interrupt pain signals with electrical stimulation, offering new hope for targeting and managing this debilitating condition.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival classics after finally regaining legal control over his iconic songs. For decades, Fogerty was unable to profit from or control the use of hits he wrote, like "Proud Mary," leading to a period where he refused to perform them. Encouraged by his wife Julie, he has now recorded "John's Version" of the tracks with his sons, reclaiming his musical legacy and finding peace after a long and painful legal battle.</p>

          <p>A pet sitter in Llanharan, Wales, had an unexpected experience when the pregnant Labrador she was watching went into labor a week early and delivered 14 puppies. The dog's owner was on holiday abroad at the time, having been assured the pups were not due yet and that the litter would be about half that size. The sitter described the 15-hour ordeal as a "rollercoaster of emotions," which included saving one pup born outside in the garden, with twelve of the puppies ultimately surviving.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author, a self-described liberal, makes a case for hunting as a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to factory farming. She recounts her own journey to hunting, the complex emotions of taking an animal's life, and the deep connection to nature and conservation it fosters. The author argues that many hunters are deeply invested in wildlife management and ecosystem health, and that the reflexive disdain from the political left for the practice is often misplaced and overlooks its ethical complexities.</p>

          <p>In a new film, actor Jeremy Allen White portrays Bruce Springsteen during the creation of his stark 1982 album, "Nebraska." White discusses the daunting task of playing the rock legend, particularly during a period when Springsteen was battling depression and feeling fraudulent as a person despite his artistic success. He explains how he connected with the role through the shared experience of imposter syndrome and the challenge of conveying a deep interior life, and how he earned the approval of Springsteen himself for the portrayal.</p>
