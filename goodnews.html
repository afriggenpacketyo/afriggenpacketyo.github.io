        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill has removed a controversial excise tax that would have targeted the renewable energy industry. The tax would have applied to wind and solar projects using materials from prohibited countries like China, potentially increasing energy costs for consumers. While its removal is a relief for the industry, the bill still accelerates the phase-out of key clean energy tax credits, a move that environmental groups argue will hinder the transition to cheaper, cleaner energy sources.</p>
