          <p>England flanker Abi Burton is celebrating a triumphant return to international rugby, making her World Cup debut just three years after being in a medically-induced coma. In 2021, Burton was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, a rare condition where the immune system attacks the brain, leading to a nearly four-week coma. After a grueling rehabilitation process where she had to relearn basic functions like walking and talking, she defied expectations by returning to elite sport. Her presence on the field represents an inspiring story of resilience and recovery against incredible odds.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a higher opening, signaling a potential rebound from the previous session's losses, which were driven by fiscal worries across the region. However, concerns remain as bond yields continue to climb globally. In the U.K., the 30-year bond yield reached its highest point since 1998, while France's equivalent hit a 2009 peak ahead of a contentious no-confidence vote. These anxieties are compounded by rising U.S. Treasury yields following a court ruling against President Trump's trade tariffs, creating a mixed and cautious market environment.

          <p>The high-stakes atmosphere of the 2025 US Open has fueled several on-court disputes, bringing the sport's unwritten rules of etiquette into sharp focus. Incidents involving underarm serves, failing to apologize for net-cord winners, and aiming shots at an opponent's body have sparked arguments between players and debate among fans. Players like Stefanos Tsitsipas have engaged in tense post-match discussions over these tactics, which are not explicitly against the rules but are often seen as disrespectful. The charged New York environment appears to be amplifying these contentious moments on the court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of individuals accused of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the wartime statute was not intended for use against criminal gangs in peacetime. This decision represents a significant check on the administration's immigration policies and its expansive view of executive power. The ruling blocks a key administration push, with the case now likely headed for a final decision at the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, expanding by 1.8% year-over-year, which exceeded economists' forecasts. This marks the country's fastest pace of economic growth since September 2023, primarily driven by strong domestic spending from households and the government. The positive data comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates and sounded a more optimistic tone about the economy's resilience. However, some analysts caution that this could be a high point for 2025, as consumer confidence remains somewhat fragile amid global uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a legal setback to President Donald Trump, ruling that his deployment of National Guard troops and marines to Los Angeles during protests was illegal. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the administration unlawfully used soldiers for civilian law enforcement activities, a violation of an 1878 law. The judge's scathing opinion accused the White House of attempting to turn the military into a "national police force." This ruling challenges the president's strategy of federalizing law enforcement in Democrat-run cities and may impact future deployments.</p>

Approximately 80 personnel, aided by water-dropping helicopters, managed to extinguish all active flames and stop the fire's forward progress within an hour. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the first responders for their urgent action, which averted a potentially devastating outcome amid a regional heat advisory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, 79, has pushed back against rumors circulating on social media over the Labor Day weekend suggesting he was in ill health. Speaking to reporters, he called the speculation "fake news," explaining that his brief absence from public view was due to a busy schedule of media interviews and a visit to his golf course. The president complained that the rumors began simply because he did not hold a press conference for two days. The speculation was partly fueled by comments from Vice President JD Vance, who had affirmed the president's fitness but also stated he was prepared to step in if needed.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed legislation that mandates K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges to issue alerts to families, students, and staff if immigration enforcement agents are present on campus. The bill, which now awaits the governor's signature, is a direct response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign that has created fear in immigrant communities. Proponents argue the measure is crucial for ensuring student safety and maintaining schools as secure learning environments. If signed into law, it would establish an early warning system similar to those for other campus emergencies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is undergoing a "branding supercycle," where Chinese companies are increasingly competing on global trust and recognition, not just cost. The success of brands like Pop Mart's Labubu dolls is cited as an early indicator of a much broader trend. This shift is now extending into industrial sectors, with companies like electric vehicle battery maker CATL becoming household names. The article suggests that Chinese brands in areas like cars, drones, and biotech are building brand advantage, marking a significant evolution in the country's economic identity.</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully escaped a domestic violence situation by using a discreet hand signal that was observed by a bystander. While in a 7-Eleven with her alleged abuser, the woman used the "signal for help"—tucking her thumb into her palm and closing her fingers over it—which prompted the witness to call 911. Police responded quickly and arrested the suspect, who attempted to flee. The signal, created by the Canadian Women's Foundation in 2020 and popularized on social media, has been credited with aiding multiple rescues from gender-based violence.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a prominent Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has questioned the UK government's plan to restrict a Whitehall internship program exclusively to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Arguing from her own working-class background, Gray suggested that diversity of experience is beneficial and that she learned much from colleagues from different walks of life. The government contends the change will widen the talent pool and help the civil service better reflect the country. The debate highlights differing approaches to improving social mobility and meritocracy within public service.</p>
