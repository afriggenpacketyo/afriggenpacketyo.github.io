        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households in England, Scotland, and Wales. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, this move would position Tesla to compete with established UK energy firms, potentially starting next year. The company, known for its electric vehicles and battery storage solutions, could leverage its existing customer base of EV and home battery owners. This strategic expansion into the energy supply market comes as Tesla faces increased competition and falling EV sales in key European markets.</p>

          <p>Two blind women traveling from New Orleans to Orlando reported that they were the only passengers on their Southwest Airlines flight after an almost five-hour delay. The women, Sherri Brun and Camille Tate, stated they were "forgotten about" at the gate while other passengers were rebooked onto an earlier flight from a different gate. They claim they received no communication about the change, a potential violation of the Air Carrier Access Act, which requires airlines to provide effective communication for passengers with disabilities. Southwest disputed the claim they were forgotten, stating the women were always scheduled on the delayed flight, and offered them a $100 voucher.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals can be heard, adding 15 new countries including India, Canada, and Australia to the scheme. This brings the total number of participating nations to 23 and allows the UK to remove offenders who have had a human rights claim refused, with them participating in appeals via video link from their home country. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion is designed to prevent exploitation of the immigration system and expedite removals. The move is part of a broader government strategy to take a tougher stance on foreign nationals who commit crimes in the UK.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks secured a dramatic 94-91 victory over the Seattle Storm, thanks to a game-winning layup by Dearica Hamby with just 5.6 seconds remaining. The Sparks overcame a 16-point first-quarter deficit, propelled by a versatile performance from Kelsey Plum, who finished with 20 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. The intense, back-and-forth game strengthened the Sparks' playoff positioning and marked their ninth win in their last eleven games. The victory showcased the team's resilience and competitive hunger as they continue their push in the WNBA season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed strategy, expected in the autumn, also considers tightening the drink-drive limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. This initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's "lax" driver licensing system after several deaths were caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government aims to reduce road fatalities and injuries through these tougher measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones exhibit a unique phenomenon described as a form of "music." In their early stages, after formation from a star's collapse or the merger of other objects, a black hole settles into a stable shape, releasing gravitational waves. These vibrations, or "ringdown," are a pure tone determined solely by the black hole's mass and spin, reflecting a level of mathematical perfection unique in the cosmos. Scientists are on the verge of being able to better detect and interpret these cosmic vibrations, offering new insights into the nature of spacetime.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three years old to address its low birth rate. The fixed-rate subsidy is expected to have a more significant financial impact in less affluent regions where the amount represents a larger percentage of the average income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. This policy could therefore provide a greater boost to consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years by winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. After both players finished at 16-under-par, they matched each other on the first two sudden-death holes before Rose secured the victory with a birdie on the third. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke back, tied for third. Rose's victory marks a gratifying return to form for the 45-year-old veteran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England secure jobs, addressing a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to hire staff more flexibly, even before formal vacancies arise, and to temporarily convert some support worker posts into midwifery roles. The move comes after a pandemic-era surge in training applications created a situation with up to three times more graduates than jobs in some areas. Nursing unions welcomed the news but noted the true test will be if graduates can actually find funded positions.</p>
