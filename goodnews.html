          <p>Cash App has introduced "Pools," a new peer-to-peer group payment feature designed to simplify shared expenses and expand its user base. For the first time, the platform allows contributions from individuals using Apple Pay or Google Pay, opening up its services to non-Cash App users. This strategic move aims to re-energize user growth and enhance the app's social functionality, positioning it as a comprehensive financial operating system. The initiative, developed with internal AI tools, is part of Block's broader strategy to deepen peer-to-peer engagement and compete more effectively with rivals like Venmo, prioritizing network expansion over immediate revenue.

          <p>With college tuition costs continuing to rise, many students encounter funding gaps that federal aid and scholarships cannot fully cover, prompting a turn to private student loans. The current student lending landscape is increasingly competitive, offering more flexible terms, borrower benefits, and specialized loans for diverse student populations, including undergraduates, graduate students, and international students. This article highlights top private lenders such as College Ave for flexible repayment, Sallie Mae for specialized programs, Ascent for no-cosigner loans, SoFi for member benefits, and MPOWER Financing for international students. It advises careful comparison of interest rates, repayment flexibility, and borrower benefits, while strongly recommending exhausting federal loan options first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne's cortege will make a final journey through his home city of Birmingham, offering fans a public opportunity to pay their respects. The procession will travel along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, a site where thousands of messages and floral tributes have accumulated since his passing on July 22 at 76. This event, organized ahead of a private funeral, allows his family to witness the global outpouring of love for the "Prince of Darkness." The city council has coordinated the tribute, which is fully funded by Osbourne's family, anticipating a large turnout for the beloved "son of Birmingham."</p>

These accounts offer the advantage of locking in today's high rates for a specified term and are generally considered safe investments, being FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000. Online banks typically offer the most competitive rates, and short-term CDs (six months to one year) currently provide higher yields due to an inverted yield curve.

          <p>Current mortgage and refinance interest rates present challenges for homebuyers and those considering refinancing, remaining higher than levels seen a few years ago. As of July 28, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates stand at approximately 6.79%, with 15-year rates at 6.01%. To secure the best possible rates, individuals are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid- to high-700s, and to thoroughly compare offers from various lenders. Financial experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could lead to a stabilization or even a modest decline in mortgage rates, offering some relief to borrowers.

Divorce rates have notably declined by nearly 40% since the early 1980s, and the trend of nonmarital childbearing has stabilized. Furthermore, the rate of new marriages among prime-age adults has shown an increase in recent years, suggesting a potential reversal of long-term declines. This resilience is partly attributed to marriage adapting to evolving societal norms, including greater male involvement in childcare. Despite ongoing challenges, particularly for less-educated men, marriage is increasingly linked to enhanced happiness, financial security, and overall societal well-being.</p>
