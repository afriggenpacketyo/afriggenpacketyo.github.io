          <p>Pride Month culminated in large-scale parades in cities like New York and Budapest, where participants celebrated LGBTQ+ identity while also protesting against increasing political attacks. In New York, the theme "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" reflected concerns over recent policies targeting transgender people and diversity programs in the U.S. Meanwhile, in Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, marching in a powerful display of resistance against Hungary's restrictive laws. The events underscored the dual nature of modern Pride as both a joyful celebration and a continued fight for rights.</p>

          <p>The search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, continues to captivate enthusiasts in Australia, nearly a century after it was declared extinct. Despite its official status, thousands of reported sightings fuel a dedicated community of seekers who use trail cameras and forensic techniques, hoping to prove the creature survives in the Tasmanian wilderness. In a separate, high-tech effort, a well-funded de-extinction project aims to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, though some scientists remain skeptical about the feasibility of such an endeavor.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted the ban on Japanese seafood imports that it imposed in August 2023 after Japan began releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring showed no abnormalities, leading to the decision to "conditionally resume" imports. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve relations with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. However, restrictions will remain on food from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings to lead his team to a 5-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. The 24-year-old left-hander, who entered the game in the second inning, allowed just three hits and one walk while striking out six, showcasing a significant improvement in his sophomore season. Wrobleski's recent surge, credited to mechanical adjustments and increased fastball velocity, is providing a surprising and valuable boost to the Dodgers' pitching depth as he continues to earn more opportunities.</p>
