          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, while President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with the school. The judge's injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the federal database for student visa applications. This ruling follows earlier actions by the administration, including attempts to revoke Harvard's student visa certification and bar most international students from entering the U.S., citing concerns about campus antisemitism. The legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where international students comprise a substantial portion of the student body.</p>

          <p>A study indicates that visits to locations related to anime and manga in Japan have significantly boosted local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists visited these sites, marking an increase from 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods reached an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year. The trend, known as "seichi junrei" or "holy pilgrimage," involves fans visiting real-life settings that inspired popular works. While this phenomenon offers economic benefits, local governments must address overtourism issues and provide multilingual support for visitors.</p>

While some companies allow shorts if styled professionally, others consider them too casual, particularly for client-facing roles. Stylists advise monitoring colleagues' attire and avoiding beach, sports, cargo, and denim shorts. The perception of shorts may also differ for men and women, with some men feeling uncomfortable wearing them outside of holiday settings.</p>
