          <p>CBS Miami's entertainment reporter, Lisa Petrillo, is publicly sharing her journey with breast cancer for the first time during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. After discovering a lump through a self-exam, she insisted on a screening that led to a Stage One diagnosis, followed by a successful lumpectomy and radiation treatment. By recounting her private 10-month battle, Petrillo hopes to encourage others to be proactive about their health and seek early detection, highlighting the importance of self-advocacy in medical settings.

          <p>Authorities in Somaliland have successfully rescued eleven cheetah cubs that were being trafficked for the illegal exotic pet trade, marking one of the largest such confiscations. The malnourished cubs were discovered packed in bags on a small boat off the coast and have been taken to a rescue center for care, though two have since died. Conservationists highlight that this incident underscores the severe threat the illegal pet trade poses to the cheetah population, which numbers fewer than 7,000 in the wild, making every rescue critical for the species' survival.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a significant change to its business model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This move, which could bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, aims to eliminate unnecessary markups and give lenders more choice. Following the announcement, Fair Isaac's stock rallied over 20%, while shares of the major credit bureaus declined, signaling a potential disruption in how credit scores are distributed in the mortgage industry.

          <p>A man who disrupted a lecture at the University of Washington with Nazi salutes and racial slurs was chased off campus by dozens of students and the professor. The individual, who later identified himself as a "Nazi sympathizer," was followed by the group until university police arrived and took him into custody. The university has since banned the man, who is not affiliated with the school, from campus and is expected to refer the case for criminal charges, underscoring a strong community response against hate speech.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost for a $90,000 home equity loan has decreased compared to earlier in the year. For a 15-year term, the payment is now approximately $871, down from about $886 in February, while a 10-year term costs around $1,108 per month. The article advises homeowners that while borrowing against home equity is currently less expensive, they should carefully consider their ability to repay, as the home serves as collateral for the loan.
