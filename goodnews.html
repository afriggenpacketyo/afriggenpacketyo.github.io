        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, reporting 497,099 units delivered. This growth occurred just as a significant federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired. Despite the rise in deliveries, production saw a slight decline compared to the previous year, and the company's stock dipped following the report. The sales figures were bolstered by a rush of U.S. buyers ahead of the tax credit expiration, which helped offset a continuing sales slump in Europe attributed to competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated that a decision is forthcoming on potentially replacing the league's current profit and sustainability rules (PSR). The existing regulations, which limit clubs to losses of £105 million over three years, have faced criticism for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's model, which would cap spending on squad-related costs at a percentage of club revenue. Masters suggested a potential 85% cap to align more closely with European standards while still encouraging investment in the league.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that even puzzles some Finns. The World Happiness Report measures contentment based on how close individuals feel their life is to their best possible life, rather than daily joy. Experts suggest Finland's success stems from a societal structure that provides strong public services, such as extensive free libraries, and fosters a sense of collective well-being through higher taxes. Access to nature and cultural practices like saunas also contribute to a high quality of life and overall contentment among its citizens.</p>

          <p>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer has revealed that becoming a grandmother last year has reignited her love for acting and changed her professional approach. Speaking on a podcast, the 67-year-old star explained that she now feels more relaxed and present in her roles, having shed the deep-seated angst that previously accompanied her process. This newfound perspective has allowed her to enjoy her work more than ever, even while juggling multiple projects, including a "Yellowstone" spinoff. Pfeiffer believes this relaxed mindset has not only freed her up personally but has also improved her performances, allowing her to better balance her demanding career with her personal life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regular physical exercise is a powerful tool for enhancing mental well-being, with different types of workouts offering distinct psychological benefits. Scientific research shows that aerobic activities like running are particularly effective at boosting mood-regulating neurochemicals, helping to alleviate symptoms of depression. Meanwhile, strength training can increase self-confidence, and practices like yoga are especially beneficial for managing stress. For those who are currently sedentary, the greatest happiness gains come from simply starting a routine, as even moderate activity can significantly reduce negative feelings like depression and hostility over time.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after battering Bermuda with powerful winds and heavy rain as a Category 2 hurricane. While the storm caused hurricane-force gusts on the archipelago, the worst conditions have passed, and no immediate reports of significant damage have emerged. The National Hurricane Center has issued its final advisory on Imelda but noted it will remain a large system as it moves across the Atlantic. Swells generated by the storm are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast in the coming days.</p>

Ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, the Australian driver acknowledged that he "tried too hard" and needs to refocus on the consistent approach that has brought him success for most of the season.

          <p>A team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate if a "visual anomaly" is the lost aircraft of Amelia Earhart. The object, identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart disappeared. Researchers believe there is "very strong" evidence that the anomaly, known as the Taraia Object, could be Earhart's Electra 10E plane. The expedition plans to use sonar and magnetometers to scan the object before attempting to dredge it for positive identification, potentially solving the 88-year-old mystery.</p>

          <p>The enduring mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance has long fueled conspiracy theories, which this article argues overshadow her real accomplishments. Prompted by President Trump's order to declassify records, the analysis asserts that the most credible evidence points to Earhart and her navigator running out of fuel and crashing into the Pacific. The article traces the origins of espionage and capture theories back to wartime propaganda and financial opportunism, including from her own husband. It calls for remembering Earhart not for the myths surrounding her death, but for her pioneering achievements as a record-setting pilot and an advocate for women in aviation.</p>

This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to pay down its debt, a move its CEO says will enable the company to restart its stock buyback program. Berkshire Hathaway is already a major shareholder in Occidental, holding a 28.2% stake in the Houston-based oil and gas company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investment analysis addresses the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with lower share prices have greater upside potential than those with higher prices. The article argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value or growth prospects, and investors should instead focus on underlying business fundamentals. Using the example of Nvidia versus International Paper, it demonstrates how a high-priced stock with strong growth drivers can vastly outperform a low-priced stock in a mature industry. The key to successful investing lies in assessing a company's real value and future earnings potential, not its arbitrary share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches new all-time highs, some financial advisors are suggesting that investors reconsider the popular strategy of passively investing solely in an S&P 500 index fund. They argue that the index has become heavily concentrated in a few large-cap technology companies, reducing its diversification and making it more volatile. To mitigate this risk, experts recommend broadening investment exposure by considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or by adding allocations to international stocks, value funds, and bonds to create a more balanced and resilient portfolio.

This multi-year process presents a significant challenge, as researchers must find stable, flavor-neutral ingredients and secure FDA approval.

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated on October 3rd, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9th, the day the Berlin Wall fell, because the latter date is tragically associated with the 1938 Nazi pogroms known as "Reichspogromnacht." The holiday is typically observed quietly, with official celebrations rotating annually among Germany's federal states. Despite over three decades of political unity, recent polls indicate that a significant portion of the population, particularly in the east, feels that the country has not yet fully grown together, with economic disparities remaining a key issue.</p>

Tokenization involves creating a digital representation of a physical asset on a blockchain, which proponents argue will increase market efficiency.

Her work helped redefine the scientific understanding of animals as beings with complex social and emotional lives. This perspective led her to become a vocal opponent of factory farming and invasive animal experimentation, positions that sometimes put her at odds with the mainstream scientific community. Goodall used her global platform to argue that humanity's dominion over other species lacks a moral basis, making her a beloved figure within the animal rights movement.</p>
