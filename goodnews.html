          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported delivering over 34,000 cars in June, marking its eighth consecutive month of strong sales despite a fierce price war in the domestic market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed results. The intense competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, is also pressuring international players like Tesla, which saw its market share and sales in China decline. This report highlights the volatile and competitive landscape of China's rapidly growing EV industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to US President Donald Trump, Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with a formal proposal to be delivered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is the best offer they will receive and that the situation will only worsen otherwise. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The potential truce would allow for further negotiations aimed at ending the long-running conflict and securing the release of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke the status in September, but the judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate a country's TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The ruling provides temporary relief for Haitians who have built lives in the U.S., citing reliance on the existing deadline. The White House has stated its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. 3M, the company that developed the chemicals, has agreed to stop producing them and pay the state $850 million for cleanup, marking a significant victory for public health advocates.</p>

The device, modernized from a 19th-century concept, has been distributed to thousands of frontline medics and hospitals, significantly improving survival rates for soldiers with otherwise fatal injuries.
