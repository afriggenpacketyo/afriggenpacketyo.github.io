          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its ambition to send astronauts to the moon, successfully completing a comprehensive test of its crewed lunar lander, Lanyue. The prototype underwent trials simulating lunar gravity and terrain to verify the integration of its landing, ascent, and control systems. This test marks a critical step towards China's goal of a crewed lunar landing before 2030. The Lanyue lander is designed to transport two astronauts and serve as their habitat and operational hub on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>New York City officials have identified three more victims from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, nearly 24 years after the event. The identifications of Barbara Keating, Ryan Fitzgerald, and an unnamed woman were made possible through advanced DNA analysis of remains recovered from the World Trade Center site. This ongoing effort by the city's chief medical examiner's office has now led to the identification of 1,653 of the 2,753 people killed in New York. The families expressed gratitude for the city's persistent work, which provides a measure of closure after decades.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend approximately $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as appeasing President Trump's administration without committing to final iPhone assembly in the country. The announcement highlighted partnerships with long-term U.S. suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components, and a commitment to buy U.S.-made chips from TSMC's Arizona plant. This strategic announcement appeared to successfully deflect pressure regarding tariffs, as Trump subsequently announced an exemption for Apple on new chip tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
