        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday as investors eagerly awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's address at the Jackson Hole economic forum. Market participants are closely scrutinizing his remarks for any hints regarding a potential interest rate cut at the central bank's upcoming September meeting, especially given the Fed's cautious stance this year despite pressure for lower rates. The Federal Reserve faces the complex task of balancing inflation control with maximum employment, a challenge exacerbated by recent job growth slowdowns and tariff-driven price increases. Powell's assessment of inflation trends towards the 2% target will be a key determinant for market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, indicate that rising tariff costs have not yet significantly impacted consumer spending, as they implement creative strategies to mitigate price increases. These tactics involve diversifying supply chains, negotiating with vendors, and selectively adjusting prices to avoid spooking customers or attracting White House scrutiny. While overall consumer spending remains resilient, lower-income households show greater sensitivity to price shifts. Some companies, like Walmart, are leveraging new revenue streams such as advertising and third-party marketplaces to bolster earnings amidst economic pressures. The evolving trade landscape continues to present challenges and uncertainties for the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

With around 500 studios and 15,000 employees in 2022, Poland stands among Europe's leading gaming nations, having produced critically acclaimed titles like "Cyberpunk 2077" and "The Witcher." Despite the recent global gaming industry downturn, Polish developers, especially indie studios, are actively seeking increased government financial support to address challenges such as investor withdrawals and the growing impact of AI on various roles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>John Deere is navigating a challenging period marked by decreasing demand in the agricultural sector, resulting in significant drops in net income and sales, alongside recent layoffs of 238 factory workers. Farmers are curtailing equipment purchases due to lower crop prices and escalating operational costs, with Deere also absorbing substantial tariff expenses. Despite these immediate difficulties, the company is committing to a "bold move" by investing $20 billion into U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, reflecting confidence in long-term growth, particularly in expanding markets like Europe and South America. Analysts anticipate a cyclical rebound in the agricultural sector, foreseeing an attractive future for Deere, especially in precision agriculture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the United States, under President Trump, retreats from global clean energy investment and labels wind and solar power a "scam of the century," Chinese cleantech firms are actively expanding into emerging markets across Southeast and Central Asia, and Latin America. Malaysian start-ups like Mabill Technologies are noting renewed interest from Chinese investors, who are strategically integrating proprietary technologies into local supply chains and promoting Chinese technical standards. This "tech diplomacy" positions China as a clean energy hub, while it retains control over critical intellectual property. The shift raises important questions about environmental enforcement and the adoption of sustainable practices in these developing regions.</p>

          <p>A reported active shooter situation at Villanova University in Pennsylvania on Thursday was quickly declared a "cruel hoax" by both school president and Delaware County officials. The university had issued an alert for a possible shooter in the law school during its orientation Mass, triggering a massive response from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. Thankfully, no victims were found, and no actual shooting occurred, leading to the lifting of the campus-wide shelter-in-place order. Governor Josh Shapiro pledged to prosecute those responsible for the "swatting" attempt, recognizing the profound fear it instilled in students and their families on the university's "opening day."</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Meadowlands, once infamous as a wasteland, has undergone a remarkable transformation into a vital salt marsh ecosystem, successfully balancing waste disposal, urban development, and environmental protection. This "Lazarus-like" resurrection, now home to over 300 bird species, is largely attributed to decades of strategic state and federal policies, including compensatory mitigation funded by major development projects like the American Dream mall. However, this unique conservation model is currently under threat following the 2023 Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA, which significantly restricted the Clean Water Act's protections for wetlands. Experts stress the critical role of public perception in safeguarding this irreplaceable urban wilderness.</p>

          <p>A significant GiveDirectly study in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 per household reduced infant and child mortality by a remarkable 48%. The mechanism is not definitively clear but may involve increased hospital births and improved food security for mothers. While the dramatic reduction in deaths is noteworthy, the study also highlights that the cost-effectiveness for saving lives ($299,418 per life) is not competitive with other targeted health interventions like Vitamin A supplementation or malaria prevention. This research emphasizes that while cash transfers reduce poverty, their direct impact on mortality, though significant, comes with important caveats.</p>
