          <p>A new bill passed by California lawmakers requires K-12 schools and public colleges to implement emergency alert systems to notify students, families, and staff about the presence of immigration enforcement agents on campus. The legislation, authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, aims to empower school communities to make informed decisions regarding their safety amid the Trump administration's heightened deportation efforts. Supported by the state's superintendent of public instruction, the bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature to take immediate effect, reflecting a broader legislative push in Democratic-led states to protect immigrant communities from federal crackdowns.</p>

          <p>Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and marking the quickest growth rate since September 2023. The positive economic data follows a recent interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which cited increased clarity on global trade uncertainties as a reason for optimism. Despite the strong quarterly performance, the RBA has slightly lowered its overall economic growth forecast for the year, attributing the revision to a weaker outlook for productivity growth rather than trade disruptions.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the popularity of brands like Pop Mart's Labubu dolls signals the beginning of a major branding boom for Chinese companies on the global stage. The piece contends that Chinese firms are moving beyond a reputation for low-cost manufacturing to building consumer trust in higher-value sectors such as electric vehicles, batteries, and drones. Citing the success of companies like Xiaomi and CATL, the author suggests that brand recognition is becoming as crucial as hardware, indicating a fundamental shift in China's business mindset from a cost advantage to a brand advantage.</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully signaled for help during a domestic violence incident by using a hand gesture popularized on social media. A bystander at a 7-Eleven recognized the signal—tucking the thumb into the palm and closing the fingers over it—and called 911, leading to a swift police response. The suspect, a convicted felon with an active warrant, was arrested after attempting to flee. The incident highlights the effectiveness of the discrete signal, which was created by the Canadian Women’s Foundation in 2020 to help individuals in danger seek assistance non-verbally.</p>

          <p>A jury in Los Angeles has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a civil lawsuit filed by a security guard who alleged the star assaulted her at a doctor's office in 2018. The guard, Emani Ellis, claimed Cardi B spat on her and cut her face with a fingernail during an argument, seeking $24 million in damages. Cardi B testified that while a heated verbal altercation occurred after she feared the guard was filming her during a private pregnancy, it never became physical. The jury deliberated for only an hour before returning a verdict in the rapper's favor.</p>

          <p>A federal judge noted that the rise of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT "changed the course" of the landmark antitrust case against Google, influencing the decision on remedies. While finding Google illegally maintained a search monopoly, the judge ruled against the government's most severe proposal to force a sale of the Chrome browser. The ruling acknowledged the highly competitive and rapidly evolving AI landscape as a new factor in the market. This development provided a crucial context that ultimately helped Google avoid a structural break-up, despite losing the initial trial.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has allowed Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to return to her position after she was fired by President Trump. In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that the president cannot remove FTC commissioners without cause, upholding nearly a century of legal precedent designed to insulate independent agencies from political pressure. The ruling rejected the Trump administration's request to delay her reinstatement during its appeal. This legal battle is seen as a significant test of presidential power over the leadership of independent regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that waxworms, a type of caterpillar, can consume and break down polyethylene, the world's most common plastic. The study revealed that the caterpillars convert the plastic into body fat, with about 2,000 waxworms capable of breaking down a plastic bag within 24 hours. While the worms cannot survive solely on a plastic diet, scientists are optimistic that with dietary supplements, they could be used as a biological tool to help manage plastic waste. This discovery presents a potential new avenue for addressing the global plastic pollution crisis.</p>

          <p>The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has begun erupting again, sending fountains of lava up to 330 feet into the air from its summit crater. This marks the 32nd episode of activity since the current eruption cycle started in December 2024, with all lava flows remaining contained within Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are closely monitoring the activity, which is caused by magma rising from a lower chamber and forcing its way to the surface. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes.</p>

          <p>Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, jumped 8% in after-hours trading after a federal judge issued remedies in its landmark antitrust case that were less severe than investors had feared. The judge ruled against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser or Android operating system, which were the government's most drastic proposals. Instead, the court ordered Google to end exclusive contracts for search engine placement and to share some search data with rivals. The market's positive reaction reflects relief that the company will avoid a forced structural break-up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a rise in parking-related fraud, police and councils are warning the public about common scams, including fake text messages and tampered payment machines. Experts advise that genuine fines will always include the vehicle registration, time, and location of the offense. Suspicious texts demanding immediate payment via a link should be ignored, as they often lead to clone websites designed to steal financial information. Additionally, drivers should inspect contactless readers on parking machines for skimming devices, which can look like mismatched or bolted-on attachments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at sanctioning Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals. The legislation also targets Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures, such as "know-your-customer" procedures, to prevent their products from entering the illicit drug trade. Supporters of the bill argue it is a necessary step to attack the production of fentanyl at its source, while others emphasize that sanctions must be paired with effective diplomacy and international law enforcement cooperation.</p>

The decision was a positive outcome for both tech giants, as it preserves a key partnership and revenue stream that had been threatened by the Justice Department's lawsuit.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a sharply worded opinion, a federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement purposes in Los Angeles was a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic policing. The judge's ruling found that the administration knowingly worked to circumvent the law by claiming a broad "constitutional exception" to justify its actions. This decision serves as a significant legal rebuke of the administration's expansive view of presidential power and could impact future plans for similar deployments in other U.S. cities.</p>
