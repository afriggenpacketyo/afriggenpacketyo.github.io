          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying a major security operation, one of its largest in peacetime, for the upcoming Brics summit. Approximately 20,000 military personnel will be mobilized to protect leaders from 28 countries and various international organizations. The security measures include a strict no-fly zone over the summit venue, enforced by armed fighter jets with authorization to shoot down unauthorized aircraft. The city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial traffic, with flights rerouted to the international terminal to ensure the safety of the high-profile event.</p>

          <p>As the Fourth of July approaches, dog owners are advised to take precautions to manage their pets' fear and anxiety caused by fireworks. Experts from Canine Companions recommend exercising dogs earlier in the day and providing mental stimulation, such as frozen food toys, to help them relax. It is strongly advised not to bring dogs to fireworks shows due to their sensitive hearing. For dogs known to be anxious, creating a safe, comfortable space at home with calming music or white noise can help mitigate stress during the noisy celebrations.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Think Tank Proposes 30 Trillion Yuan Debt Swap to Address Local Government Liabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Beijing-based think tank has recommended that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in treasury bonds to swap the hidden debts of local governments. This measure aims to tackle the country's deep-rooted financial risks and reinvigorate economic growth, which has been hampered by high local debt levels. Researchers from Tsinghua University argue that this proactive fiscal policy, combined with further investment in the property market and consumption, is necessary to achieve a comprehensive resolution. The proposal addresses the tens of trillions in off-book liabilities that pose a significant threat to China's financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has identified a new interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, making it the third confirmed object from another star system to visit our solar system. The comet is currently 420 million miles from Earth and poses no threat, traveling at a high speed of 37 miles per second. It is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers worldwide are now observing the object to determine its size and composition, with preliminary reports suggesting it is larger than the previous two interstellar visitors.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: A Path to Making GLP-1 Anti-Obesity Drugs More Affordable Through Employer Insurance</h2>

          <p>This opinion article proposes a method for making popular GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs more affordable and accessible for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons that inflates drug prices. Instead, manufacturers could offer a transparent, lower price directly to employer health plans, similar to their direct-to-consumer pricing. With employers sharing a portion of this reduced cost, employee out-of-pocket expenses could be significantly lowered, transforming public health by improving access to these effective medications.

          <h2>New Legislation Creates Temporary Federal Tax Exemption on Tips for Service Workers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 17:22:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly passed Republican spending and tax package includes a provision that creates a temporary tax exemption for tipped workers. Under the new law, which expires at the end of 2028, workers can deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their federally taxable income. The policy, a key campaign promise from President Trump, is designed to benefit most tipped workers, though it phases out for those earning over $150,000 a year. While supporters celebrate it as a win for workers, critics argue it primarily benefits middle-to-upper income earners and is part of a regressive bill.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old American woman, Aleese Lightyear, has found a dramatically improved quality of life by moving to Chengdu, China, where she works as a university teacher.

Her benefits include free health insurance, a rent stipend, and two months of paid vacation, enabling her to save money and pursue hobbies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the principles of the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence are misunderstood when viewed solely as a triumph of individualism. The author contends that the founders' actions were more of a restoration of their inherited rights as Englishmen, a view shared by conservative thinkers like Edmund Burke. Furthermore, the declaration's famous assertion of self-evident equality is not universally obvious but is deeply rooted in the biblical concept of man being created in God's image. The piece concludes that America's political and moral foundations owe more to this inherited tradition than to revolutionary liberalism.</p>

          <p>The comprehensive domestic policy bill passed by the House includes a new, temporary tax break for senior citizens. The provision adds an extra $6,000 standard deduction for individual tax filers aged 65 and older, and $12,000 for couples, for the tax years 2025 through 2028. This benefit is aimed at upper-middle-class seniors, as it phases out for those earning over $75,000 and offers no advantage to low-income seniors who already have little to no tax liability. The article clarifies this is an income tax deduction and does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market continued to show surprising strength in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' expectations. The unemployment rate also fell to a new low of 4.1%. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink due to significant layoffs. Despite the solid report, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, citing potential negative impacts from trade tariffs on economic activity and inflation.
