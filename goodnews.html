          <p>Ten American citizens detained in Venezuela are returning home following a prisoner exchange deal. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing the release, stating that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free. The exchange was facilitated by El Salvador, which released hundreds of Venezuelan nationals accused of gang activity from its prisons. Family members of the released Americans, including a Navy SEAL and another man kidnapped by border guards, expressed immense relief and gratitude for their return.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and El Salvador have confirmed a complex prisoner exchange with Venezuela, securing the release of 10 detained Americans. In the deal, El Salvador repatriated approximately 250 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and held in a maximum-security prison. U.S. officials noted that the deal went "down to the wire" and highlighted the warming relations between President Trump and Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele, who was instrumental in the negotiations. With this exchange, no U.S. nationals are currently known to be held by the Venezuelan government.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by investor Peter Thiel, has filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "BLSH." The company, led by former NYSE president Tom Farley, reported executing over $2.5 billion in average daily volume in early 2025. This move marks another step in the crypto industry's push for mainstream financial acceptance, following other recent public offerings by firms like Circle and Etoro. The filing coincides with President Trump signing new stablecoin regulations into law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Australian Prime Minister's China Visit Signals Resilience Amid US Pressure</h2>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent trip to China, which included talks with Premier Li Qiang, is being interpreted as a sign of Canberra's strengthening diplomatic resolve. The visit occurred amid ongoing pressure from the United States to adopt a more confrontational stance toward Beijing. Analysts suggest that Australia, like other nations in the region, is navigating a complex balance between its significant economic ties with China and its security alliance with the U.S. This diplomatic maneuvering indicates that making a binary choice between the two global powers is not considered a realistic option for Australia.</p>

          <p>After falling behind competitors like OpenAI and Google, Meta is rebooting its artificial intelligence strategy by launching a new division, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). The company is reportedly spending heavily to recruit top AI talent with the goal of building "personal superintelligence for everyone." This represents a significant pivot for the company, which once led in AI research but struggled to translate its work into competitive consumer products. The new focus may also shift Meta away from its previous "open source" approach as it races to catch up in the AI arms race.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced that the firm will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, whose acquisition by Chevron was recently completed. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often boosts a company's stock price as index funds must purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down for the year, Block's market capitalization of approximately $45 billion is well above the median for companies in the index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will no longer use engineers based in China to provide technical support for its U.S. defense clients' cloud services. The policy change is a direct response to national security and cybersecurity concerns, highlighted in a recent ProPublica report. The report detailed how the previous arrangement, which involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising more technically skilled engineers in China, could create vulnerabilities. The move affects Microsoft's Azure cloud division, which has significant contracts with the U.S. government, including a multi-billion dollar deal with the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that approximately two-thirds of Americans favor the U.S. pursuing space exploration, including returning to the moon and undertaking a mission to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority of the public believes the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile achievement. These positive views on space exploration generally cut across partisan and ideological lines, with many feeling the space program contributes to national pride and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>The stock price of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed 189% in one week, largely driven by social media posts from hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had nearly shut down, announced he was reinvesting in the beaten-down stock, speculating it could be a "100-bagger." This triggered a massive rally, despite no fundamental improvements in the cash-burning company's business. The event highlights the growing influence of social media on stock market volatility and the appetite among retail investors for high-risk, "downtrodden" comeback stories.

          <p>The Druze are a religious sect with origins tracing back about 1,000 years to an offshoot of Shiite Islam, now caught in recent violence in Syria. Their religious practices are largely secret, conversion is not permitted, and intermarriage is discouraged, fostering a tight-knit community. A core social doctrine is mutual defense, treating the global Druze population as a large, interconnected tribe. While most of the world's 1 million Druze live in Syria, with other communities in Lebanon and Israel, they have a history of navigating complex political landscapes to ensure their survival and autonomy.</p>

England's Matt Fitzpatrick is in close pursuit, finishing the day one stroke behind Scheffler at nine under par, setting up a high-stakes pairing for the weekend. Other notable players like Rory McIlroy remain in contention, but Scheffler's current form makes him the clear and formidable favorite heading into the final 36 holes.</p>

His statement was cautiously welcomed by postal union leaders, who have been protesting Trump administration talk of overhauling the agency.

While bitcoin's price slipped slightly, ether advanced 18% for the week, marking its strongest two-week gain since 2021.
