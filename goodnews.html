          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprise pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, narrowly outperforming Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Russell's final qualifying lap was just 0.007 seconds faster, securing his first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix. The result places him in a strong starting position ahead of championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris of McLaren, who qualified third and fifth, respectively. Verstappen expressed frustration after his final lap was impeded by Norris, suggesting the incident may have cost him the top spot.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated strong performance, with the S&P 500 reaching new record highs despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The market's positive reaction suggests investors have largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event for the economy. The healthcare, utilities, and information technology sectors led the week's gains, partly driven by a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs and continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The article also details specific stock movements within the CNBC Investing Club portfolio, including purchases of Nike and Boeing shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's national rugby team, the Springboks, defeated Argentina 29-27 to win their second consecutive Rugby Championship title. The victory was secured at London's Allianz Stadium after New Zealand's earlier win over Australia set the stage for a title-deciding match. Despite an early lead from Argentina, the Springboks' dominant forward play in the second half, featuring tries from Malcolm Marx and Cobus Reinach, proved decisive. This victory highlights the team's strength and depth as they build towards the 2027 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat popular from the 1940s to the 1970s, has largely vanished from American delicatessens and lunchboxes. Initially valued for its affordability and visual appeal, its decline began in the 1970s due to growing health concerns about sodium, preservatives, and processed meats. Shifting consumer preferences towards fresher, more natural foods, along with the rise of convenient microwaveable meals, further diminished its popularity. While some retain a nostalgic fondness for the meat, experts believe a significant comeback is unlikely without a modern rebranding focused on health-conscious ingredients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts argue that American investors are overly concentrated in domestic assets, a phenomenon known as "home bias." They suggest that diversifying into international markets, particularly emerging economies, could offer better long-term value and growth opportunities. China is highlighted as a market with significant long-term potential, while India is noted for its large population, strong demographics, and rapid economic growth, which is driving consumption. This trend mirrors the growth trajectory China experienced over the past two decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza ceasefire and peace proposal outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other elements of the deal require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. U.S. officials view the response as a positive step, and Israel is reportedly preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, expressing his belief that Hamas is ready for a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromos, gathered in Addis Ababa for the annual Irreecha thanksgiving festival. The event is a celebration to thank their God, Waaqa, and to promote peace and unity among the Oromo clans. The festival has seen a revival since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is of Oromo heritage, came to power, allowing for greater cultural expression. However, despite this newfound freedom, some Oromos criticize Ahmed's administration, arguing that many of their community's broader political and social demands remain unaddressed.</p>

He lives comfortably on a monthly income of approximately $4,000 from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English, paying just $850 in rent for a modern two-bedroom apartment. Ryan contrasts his life in Vietnam, where he feels motivated and free from financial pressure, with his experience in the U.S., which he describes as a constant struggle to achieve an unattainable standard of living.

The Japanese-led restoration project focused on renovating the tomb's intricate wall paintings, which depict the pharaoh with various deities and scenes from the Book of the Dead. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism industry, a crucial source of foreign currency for the country's economy.</p>

          <p>Current Lyft CEO David Risher recounted his 1996 decision to leave a successful management role at Microsoft for a then-small online bookstore called Amazon. Risher was persuaded by founder Jeff Bezos's compelling vision and obsession with customer experience, a move that Microsoft's Bill Gates reportedly called "the stupidest decision." Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early. Risher played a key role in that growth, helping expand Amazon's product categories beyond books during his tenure as a senior vice president.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist recommends a unique practice for parents: creating an email address for their newborn children and regularly sending them messages. This creates a digital time capsule of memories, stories, and advice that the children can access when they are older. The expert suggests writing on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to provide a full picture of family life. The practice serves as both a legacy of love for the child and a therapeutic journaling outlet for the parent, preserving a connection that can be treasured for a lifetime.</p>

In a film accompanying her new album, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering.

The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and high customer retention, Workiva's lack of profitability has caused its stock to trade at a discount.
