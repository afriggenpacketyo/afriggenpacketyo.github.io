          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a tight qualifying session, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri. Verstappen's final lap was just enough to edge out Piastri, with Lando Norris taking third and George Russell fourth, setting the stage for a competitive race. Despite a challenging session with shifting winds, Verstappen's performance on a high-speed track like Silverstone demonstrated his skill. The results promise an exciting race with several top drivers closely matched.</p>

          <p>A phenomenon known as 'tipflation' is causing confusion and pressure for consumers as more businesses use digital payment systems with pre-calculated tipping options. This article explores how technology has expanded tip requests from traditional service settings to fast-food counters and self-service kiosks. While some tip to reward good service, many now feel a social pressure or obligation, influenced by interface designs that make it easier to tip than to opt out. This shift is reshaping long-standing social norms around gratuity.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations on the implementation mechanism, a development President Trump called "very positive." While optimism for a deal is growing, a Palestinian official noted that Hamas is still seeking guarantees for a complete end to the war and an Israeli withdrawal. The potential breakthrough comes as the death toll in Gaza continues to climb.</p>

          <p>A 'cortisol cocktail' has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the alcohol-free beverage can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The drink typically contains ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium powder. However, medical experts interviewed for this article state there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. While the mocktail is likely harmless for most people and can aid in hydration, doctors say it is not a proven method for managing stress or reducing cortisol levels.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai typewriter, an innovative machine from the 1940s designed to type complex Chinese characters, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a crucial step in the evolution of modern Chinese computing. Its unique system broke down characters by shape rather than sound, a concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The rediscovery is being celebrated by scholars as finding a key artifact in the history of language and technology.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington state's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change negative public perceptions of the creatures.

The research aims to highlight the vital role sharks play and generate support for their conservation, which has been challenging due to their fearsome reputation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscientific findings, suggests that the physiological response to an emotion lasts only about 90 seconds unless a person consciously renews it by replaying the triggering thought. By allowing oneself this brief period to feel the emotion and then choosing to shift focus, individuals can prevent themselves from getting stuck in prolonged states of unhappiness. This practice encourages a more mindful and intentional response to life's upsets.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish culture of embracing hobbies for happiness, a business school professor undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different activities, from woodworking to mahjong. In this article, she details how the experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and become more confident. She argues that pursuing hobbies is not a luxury to be enjoyed after finding balance, but is instead the secret to creating it by forcing individuals to define boundaries outside of work and obligations.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the remarkable progress in combating heart disease, noting that the proportion of U.S. deaths attributable to heart attacks has fallen by nearly 90 percent since 1970. This success is credited to a combination of factors, including major public health campaigns against smoking, the development of preventative medicines like statins, and advancements in emergency treatments such as CPR and angioplasty. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, surviving an acute heart attack is now far more likely than it was decades ago.</p>
