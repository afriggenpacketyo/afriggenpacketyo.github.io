          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in the coming years as it increasingly relies on generative AI tools. In a memo to employees, Jassy stated that AI agents will change the way work is done, leading to fewer people in some roles and more in others. Amazon is investing heavily in AI, with plans to build numerous AI agents to automate tedious tasks and free up human workers for more creative roles. While some employees express concerns about an intensified work environment, Amazon aims to use AI to improve customer experiences and drive innovation. </p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is set to announce an update to its Graviton4 chip, boasting 600 gigabytes per second of network bandwidth, positioning it as a leader in public cloud offerings. This move highlights AWS's successful custom chip strategy, challenging traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. The company is also competing with Nvidia in the artificial intelligence infrastructure space, with its Project Rainier AI supercomputer built for Anthropic. AWS aims to reduce AI training costs and provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs, as demonstrated by Anthropic's use of Trainium2 GPUs for its Claude Opus 4 AI model. </p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer rushed to pick up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit, fearing intervention from White House security. The incident occurred during a discussion about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, with Starmer kneeling to gather the scattered documents. Starmer highlighted the trade deal's importance for Jaguar Land Rover workers and the removal of tariffs on the aerospace sector. However, the deal did not address steel import charges, and opposition parties criticized it as a "tiny tariff deal." This situation underscores the delicate balance of diplomacy and security protocols in international summits. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>James Gunn, co-head of DC Studios, believes the movie industry is "dying" due to incomplete screenplays and Hollywood's focus on output over quality. He emphasized DC Studios' commitment to finished scripts and high-quality projects, contrasting it with Marvel Studios' increased output under Disney's directive. Gunn addressed rumors about Matt Reeves' "The Batman" sequel, confirming it is still in development but delayed. He also reflected on his past scandal and how it influenced his creative process, focusing on creating authentic work rather than seeking approval. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, passed by a majority of 242 votes, means women who terminate their pregnancies outside the current legal framework will no longer face criminal investigation. The law will still penalize anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion outside the legal framework. The move was welcomed by abortion providers and women's rights campaigners, but criticized by anti-abortion groups. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband Bob in 2001 has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison, maintaining her innocence. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new DNA testing revealed foreign male DNA on key items and cast doubt on the original evidence. The prosecution admitted that the new evidence differed significantly from what was presented at trial. The charges against Dorotik were ultimately dismissed, but she has filed a civil suit against the County of San Diego. </p>
