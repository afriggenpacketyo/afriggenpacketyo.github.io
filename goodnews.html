          <p>American Airlines reported a smaller-than-expected loss for its third quarter, significantly outperforming Wall Street's forecasts. The airline also provided an optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, projecting earnings between 45 and 75 cents per share, well above analyst expectations. This positive financial performance led to a surge in the company's stock. The improved forecast suggests the airline is navigating challenges like domestic flight oversupply more effectively than anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with quantum computing firms like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum to acquire equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with Washington's strategy to invest in industries critical to national security, following similar investments in rare earths company MP Materials and semiconductor firm Intel. Such unprecedented government intervention outside of a financial crisis signals a shift towards greater state involvement in strategic technologies. Experts view quantum computing as vital for its economic and security implications, particularly in competition with China.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is pursuing a loan currency swap with China, aiming to convert approximately $15 billion of its external debt into yuan. This move, following a similar action by Kenya, could significantly reduce interest rates from 7.25% to 3%, providing crucial fiscal relief for the East African nation. The initiative also supports China's strategic objective of accelerating the internationalization of its currency, the renminbi. Ethiopia's request, made during high-level talks in Beijing, marks a growing trend among countries like Sri Lanka and Hungary seeking cheaper finance through the Chinese currency.</p>

          <p>An autistic man, Tom Boyd, who volunteered unpaid for four years at Waitrose, has received a paid job offer from rival supermarket Asda. Waitrose had ended his work experience placement after his mother inquired about paid hours, a decision she found "overwhelming." Tom, who has limited communication skills, was praised for his work ethic at Waitrose and sought to "belong, contribute, and make a difference." This positive development follows public outcry and support from Greater Manchester's mayor, highlighting the importance of inclusive employment practices for neurodivergent individuals.</p>

          <p>China and Indonesia are partnering to create a remote sensing center, aiming to significantly enhance environmental monitoring capabilities for both nations. This initiative will provide crucial technical support for resource management in areas such as agriculture, forestry, and water resources. The technology will enable monitoring of vessel traffic for illegal fishing, mapping coastal erosion, and tracking marine ecosystem health. This agreement marks a new stage in their relations, fostering data-sharing, research, and capacity building, and promoting mutual benefits in environmental protection and resource management.</p>

This measure comes amidst the ongoing US government shutdown, which could prevent these workers from receiving their wages.

          <p>An expert's analysis of over a hundred past societal crises, spanning two millennia, reveals a recurring mechanism called the "wealth pump" driving instability. This process involves the concentration of wealth and power among elites at the expense of the majority, leading to popular discontent, elite overproduction, and frustrated aspirations. Historically, crises often ended through disintegration, civil war, or epidemics, but successful resolutions without major bloodshed have become more frequent over time. The article suggests that rebalancing wealth and power through progressive taxation, labor market restructuring, and political reform can promote long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Weather warnings for the UK have been significantly reduced as Tropical Storm Benjamin clears eastward through the English Channel. Initially named by Météo France, the storm brought winds up to 100mph to northern France.

Some localized flooding is still possible, and gusts of 40-55mph may cause travel disruption.

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a new species of pachycephalosaur, named Zavacephale rinpoche, in southeast Mongolia, representing the earliest definitive pachycephalosaur ever found. This "magical" specimen, unearthed with a remarkably complete skeleton, fills a critical gap in the early evolution of dome-headed dinosaurs. The juvenile dinosaur, about the size of a German shepherd, reveals new insights into the species, including tiny hand bones and fully developed domes for head-butting at a young age. The fossil will be preserved in Mongolia, contributing significantly to paleontology.</p>

The confidential 28-page document outlines federal demands for significant policy changes at UCLA, including admissions practices, protest rules, and a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for minors. The Trump administration had previously suspended research funding over alleged civil rights violations. UC had argued that public disclosure would impede negotiations, but the court prioritized public interest in deliberations concerning a top university.</p>

          <p>Scott Cooper's "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere" is reviewed as a character study rather than a typical music biopic, focusing on Bruce Springsteen's contemplative period leading to his 1982 album "Nebraska." Jeremy Allen White embodies Springsteen, capturing his intense soulfulness in a performance that symbolizes the artist. The film delves into the isolating and transformative creative process, showcasing how Springsteen synthesized personal memories and external influences to produce the album. While praised for its process-centric approach and authentic style, the review notes it meanders towards the end, losing some footing.</p>

Despite his directorial career receding, his musical influence, characterized by synthy, hypnotic scores, continues to grow, impacting modern artists. Carpenter, who now tours with his music, attributes his initial stage fright to a high school incident but credits his drummer for helping him overcome it. He expresses gratitude for music as a "blessing" that offers a different kind of fulfillment than the pressures of filmmaking.</p>
