          <p>The article reports the price of gold at $4,058.08 per ounce as of October 9, 2025. It explains that gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, particularly during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Several factors influencing its price are detailed, including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, and central bank policies. The text highlights the inverse relationship between gold prices and interest rates, noting that the metal's value tends to rise when currency purchasing power erodes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes the New Jersey gubernatorial race, positing that Republican Jack Ciattarelli's path to victory hinges on strong voter turnout and enthusiasm in South Jersey. It notes that while polls show Democrat Mikie Sherrill with a slight lead, past polling inaccuracies suggest the race may be closer than it appears. The author argues that Ciattarelli needs to energize his base in rural and exurban areas to counter the Democratic ground game in denser urban centers. The piece also discusses campaign strategies, including Sherrill's focus on linking Ciattarelli to Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation, a move intended to prevent "bracket creep." This annual update means Americans will need to earn more before moving into a higher tax bracket. For 2026, the standard deduction will be $32,200 for married couples filing jointly and $16,100 for single filers. The article also explains the U.S. progressive tax system and notes how the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes certain tax cuts permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 has been awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democracy and human rights in her country. The Nobel Committee highlighted her "brave and committed" struggle against Venezuela's expanding authoritarianism and her steadfast support for a peaceful democratic transition. In their announcement, the committee emphasized that democracy is a precondition for lasting peace and is currently in retreat globally. Machado founded the Atenea Foundation and the pro-democracy group Súmate, and she continues to lead opposition forces despite being expelled from office in 2014.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Identifies Worrying About Downside Risk as the Biggest Mistake for Young Investors</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant error young investors make is prioritizing the preservation of wealth over its growth. He argues that young people, who have a long time horizon, should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. Historically, stocks have outperformed other assets over long periods, making them essential for building wealth and outpacing inflation. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs to achieve diversified exposure without the risks of individual stock picking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as player-manager for Barnet between 2012 and 2014. Davids, known for his iconic goggles and illustrious career, joined the struggling club, demanding players call him "Mister" and famously wore the number 1 shirt. Despite his intense, top-level mentality and on-field presence, his tenure was marked by contrasts, including skipping some away games while also playing without a salary. The story explores how his unconventional methods both unified the team and created friction, leaving a lasting, surreal legacy at the club.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly become one of the world's largest clothing retailers, with its annual apparel sales growing nearly 40% since 2019 to an estimated $9.7 billion. This revenue surpasses that of established apparel brands like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success is driven by offering popular brands such as Columbia and Gap alongside its own Kirkland Signature private label. A key part of Costco's strategy is its "treasure hunt" shopping experience, where opportunistic purchases of brand-name overstocks create excitement and unpredictability for customers, drawing them into the clothing aisles.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reveals the stark contrast between her polished appearance on the TV show "House Hunters Renovation" and the reality of her life at the time. While the show portrayed her and her wife as a carefree couple renovating a home, they were secretly struggling as foster parents to two young boys whose future with them was uncertain. The immense pressure of the renovation, filming, and the fragile foster care situation pushed their marriage to the breaking point, leading them to couples counseling.

In an article for a Communist Party newspaper, he stated that developing advanced domestic equipment and participating deeply in global ocean governance are critical for increasing China's voice and competitiveness.

As part of its renewed push, the NBA announced a new partnership with Alibaba to be its official cloud and AI partner.

This move follows a nine-month investigation that concluded Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power." While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation allows the CMA to impose new rules, potentially requiring fairer search rankings and giving publishers more control over their content. Google responded by warning that overly onerous regulations could inhibit innovation and slow product launches in the U.K. at a time of rapid AI development.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans is set to take effect in 2026, impacting a popular tax break for older, high-income workers. Under a provision of the Secure 2.0 Act, individuals who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their "catch-up" contributions to an after-tax Roth account. This eliminates the option for an upfront tax deduction on these additional savings for this group. Financial planners advise affected workers to begin tax projections now to decide whether to maximize pretax contributions through 2025 or to start embracing Roth savings sooner.
