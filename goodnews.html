          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a 14% increase following the announcement of a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, backed by the French state and other investors. This capital increase, along with debt refinancing, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that strengthening Eutelsat's position ensures France's strategic independence and paves the way for Europe's.

          <p>Home Depot stock is currently 18% off its all-time high, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors looking for value. Despite challenges in the housing market, Home Depot's business model has a natural hedge, as homeowners still need to perform small home improvement projects. The company has also diversified its supplier base to enhance its leverage and is the largest home improvement retail chain globally, with a robust omnichannel network. In the first fiscal quarter of 2025, sales were up 9.4%, but comparable sales were roughly flat year over year, and management is guiding for modest growth in sales and comps for the full year (not investment advice).</p>
