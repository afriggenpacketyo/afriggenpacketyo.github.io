Analysts also expressed optimism about potential growth re-acceleration at Amazon Web Services (AWS) due to its partnership with AI startup Anthropic. In other financial news, Goldman Sachs is partnering with T.

Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, is in her first major semifinal since becoming a mother, having battled her way up the rankings this year. Anisimova, who took an eight-month leave due to burnout, scored a stunning upset over world No. 2 Iga Świątek to advance. Their meeting highlights a growing conversation about mental well-being in professional sports and sets the stage for a dramatic contest between two top players on comeback trajectories.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 13:26:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits is a critical financial choice that can significantly impact retirement income, with options ranging from age 62 to 70. Claiming at 62 provides immediate funds but results in a permanently reduced monthly payment, roughly 30% lower than at full retirement age. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) secures the standard benefit, while delaying until age 70 maximizes payments, increasing them by about 8% for each year of delay. Financial experts suggest creating alternative income streams, such as from annuities or part-time work, to bridge the gap and allow benefits to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea's women's football team has agreed to a club-record deal worth nearly £1 million to sign 20-year-old American forward Alyssa Thompson from Angel City. Thompson, considered one of the world's most exciting young talents, is expected to sign a five-year contract after completing her medical. The transfer fee surpasses what Chelsea previously paid for defender Naomi Girma but falls just short of the Women's Super League record. Thompson's arrival is a significant reinforcement for Chelsea's attack, which has recently been weakened by injuries to key players Mayra Ramirez and Lauren James ahead of their season opener.</p>

The event highlights the administration's complex but often close relationship with the technology sector. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who had a public falling out with the president after briefly serving in his administration, confirmed he was invited but could not attend, sending a representative in his place. The gathering is seen as part of the administration's effort to align with industry leaders on key goals related to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and American reshoring.</p>

          <p>Ford reported a 53.7% year-over-year increase in August sales for its redesigned, three-row Expedition SUV, marking the model's best sales month in 21 years. This explosive growth for the large, gas-powered vehicle comes even as the auto industry sees a rush for electric vehicles ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. The strong performance of the Expedition, a key profit driver for Ford, signals sustained consumer interest in traditional internal combustion engines. Ford's leadership has noted the company is prioritizing hybrid models and is not as fully committed to an all-electric transition as some rivals, a strategy currently paying dividends.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has stepped down from his role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. His tenure was marked by significant commercial success, including the construction of a new £1 billion stadium, but also by frequent fan protests over a perceived lack of on-field success, with only one major trophy won during his time. Levy's departure follows a difficult league campaign and comes amid a broader leadership transition at the club, with Peter Charrington taking on the new role of non-executive chairman. The club's ownership structure will remain unchanged.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," traces the deep historical roots and lasting impact of conjure, a spiritual and medicinal practice created by enslaved people in the United States. The book argues that this tradition, rooted in West and Central African religions, has subtly shaped mainstream American culture, influencing everything from New Year's culinary traditions and the blues to folk medicine. Amid a resurgence of interest in conjure in popular culture, the book highlights the often-overlooked contributions of Black women as healers, spiritual guides, and cultural innovators throughout American history, from the antebellum period to the present day.</p>

Industry leaders report that customer acquisition costs are declining while engagement and betting volumes are surging. The kickoff is a critical period for the industry, second only to the Super Bowl for attracting new customers and driving revenue, particularly through cross-selling into more profitable online casino games.</p>
