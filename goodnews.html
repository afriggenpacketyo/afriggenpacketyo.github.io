          <h2>Chinese Researchers Observe Quantum Friction Effect in Graphene for the First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between solid surfaces, using folded layers of graphene. In their experiment, the scientists made a counterintuitive discovery: friction did not always increase with thickness, and some thicker folds of the material slid more easily. This phenomenon was traced to the way bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale machines and devices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Princeton, Texas, located north of Dallas, has been identified by the Census Bureau as the fastest-growing city in the nation, with its population surging from 17,000 to 37,000 in just three years. This explosive growth is driven by the availability of affordable housing, with homes selling for significantly less than the county's median price. However, the rapid expansion has strained the city's infrastructure, forcing a temporary halt on building to catch up on essential services like sewer lines and roads. Officials estimate they are five years behind and are racing to manage the growth, with the population expected to reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <h2>Venus Williams' Comeback Bid Halted at DC Open</h2>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, 45, was defeated by Magdalena Frech in the second round of the DC Open, ending her quest for a first two-match winning streak since 2019. Williams' first-round victory had made her the oldest woman to win a tour-level match in two decades, marking a significant moment in her return to the sport. She had been absent from the tour for over a year due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite a strong start against Frech, Williams ultimately lost in straight sets, though she received a standing ovation from the crowd for her performance.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block it. Trump had stated he would not approve a deal unless the NFL team reverted to its former "Redskins" name. The council chairman dismissed the president's comments as a distraction, expressing confidence that the agreement will pass an upcoming vote. The deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the district, marks a major step in the team's potential return to D.C. after 30 years in Maryland.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is digitally sent to a specialized facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. At the Remote Encoding Center (REC), hundreds of highly skilled employees, known as keyers, work around the clock to decipher the illegible script. These data conversion operators process images of approximately 75,000 hard-to-read letters daily, ensuring that mail with unclear addresses can reach its intended destination. This human touch serves as a critical final step in the mail sorting process, preventing countless items from being returned to sender.</p>

Watson, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, has been working with a team nutritionist to reach a more suitable playing weight.

          <p>Four former traders convicted of rigging the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a related case. The original investigation by the Serious Fraud Office centered on allegations that traders manipulated interest rates for profit during the 2008 financial crisis. With the new legal precedent set by the Supreme Court, the four appellants are likely to face a more straightforward path to potential acquittal.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats are already making strategic media appearances, signaling an unofficial start to the 2028 presidential primary season. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with non-traditional and ideologically diverse outlets, a shift in strategy from past campaigns. This early maneuvering is seen as an attempt to reach new voters and allow party elites to assess potential candidates following the 2024 election loss. Some are also adopting more centrist rhetoric on sensitive cultural topics, indicating a broader effort to course-correct the party's messaging for the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are in fact underspending in a high-stakes race for market dominance. He points to Alphabet's recent strong earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both urgent and necessary for future profitability. Cramer believes the ultimate winner in the AI chatbot space could achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive financial outlays on infrastructure and advanced chips. This perspective counters Wall Street concerns that the significant AI investments might not yield adequate returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology firms are ramping up efforts to find and produce natural food colorings as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) moves to phase out artificial dyes. The FDA has banned Red Dye No. 3 and is pushing for the voluntary elimination of other petroleum-based dyes by 2026, citing health concerns. This has created a significant market opportunity for companies like Fermentalg, which is developing a blue pigment from microalgae. Food giants such as Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to reformulate their products, facing the challenge of matching the vividness and shelf-life of synthetic colors.</p>
