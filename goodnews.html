          <p>Over 1,000 LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a historic Jubilee pilgrimage through St. Peter’s Basilica, an event officially listed on the Vatican’s Holy Year calendar. This marks the first time an LGBTQ+ pilgrimage has received such recognition, with many participants interpreting it as a significant gesture of welcome, continuing Pope Francis's inclusive approach. While Pope Leo XIV did not publicly address LGBTQ+ Catholics during his audience, he met privately with an advocate, echoing a welcoming message. The event has, however, stirred considerable controversy among traditional Catholic media and commentators, who perceive it as a departure from established Church doctrine and a challenge to its long-held traditions.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received an autographed bat from player Harrison Bader and a gift bag from the Miami Marlins after a home run ball was controversially taken from him by an adult woman during a game. Footage of the incident went viral, sparking public outcry. The man who initially secured the ball, identified as the boy's father, had given it to his son before the woman's intervention. Both the Phillies and Marlins organizations quickly addressed the situation, ensuring the young fan received special recognition and a memorable experience, ultimately turning a negative moment into a positive one. This swift response underscored the value placed on fan engagement and sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former British Army officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to advocate for greater recognition and support for female military veterans. This community interest company, which has grown to 160 members, aims to help women who performed dangerous front-line roles and now work in healthcare, as they often face isolation and misconceptions about their service. Dr. Bennett highlights that many people hold "very outdated idea[s]" about women's military involvement, leading to challenges in finding understanding and support in traditional veteran spaces. The group provides a vital, "cathartic" network for women to connect, share experiences, and overcome the unique difficulties of transitioning to civilian life.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis, who passed away at just 15, is poised to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in a canonization ceremony led by Pope Leo XIV. Acutis, dubbed "God's influencer," leveraged his passion for technology to create websites that documented miracles and disseminated Catholic teachings. His path to sainthood, initially delayed by Pope Francis's death, was solidified after two miracles were attributed to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. The Vatican's decision to fast-track his canonization is seen as a strategic move to inspire and invigorate faith among young people worldwide, offering a modern, relatable figure who embraced digital tools for spiritual outreach.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to visit the UK for a series of engagements, including announcing a substantial donation to Children in Need to support initiatives tackling youth violence, and attending the WellChild Awards, where he has been a patron for 17 years. This visit has intensified speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, hinting at a possible reconciliation between the two. The Duke's itinerary includes a private briefing and informal meetings with young people at the Community Recording Studio in Nottingham, aimed at bolstering support for local organizations. Although neither side has confirmed a royal meeting, the King's presence in the UK during this period makes an in-person reunion a distinct possibility.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, securing her first Grand Slam trophy of the year by defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a hard-fought 6-3 7-6 (7-3) match. This victory marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam singles title, and was particularly significant after she had suffered defeats in two earlier major finals this season. Despite failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set, Sabalenka showcased impressive emotional composure and tactical intelligence, ultimately dominating the tie-break. Anisimova, playing in her second major final, demonstrated resilience but was unable to maintain a consistent level against Sabalenka's powerful and steady play.</p>

          <p>A team at Los Alamos National Laboratory, employing a diagnostic device named "THOR," has announced a "game-changing" breakthrough in fusion energy by successfully achieving and sustaining burning plasma. This critical milestone, which mimics processes found within our sun, represents a significant step towards realizing nearly unlimited clean energy on Earth. Unlike traditional fission reactors, fusion promises power generation without producing long-lasting nuclear waste or carrying meltdown risks. However, the information gathered also holds value for weapons development, sparking ongoing debate. This achievement, a collaborative effort with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility, marks a crucial advancement in the quest for a sustainable and cleaner energy future, with further system refinement already underway.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their spot in the World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their impressive winning streak to 30 matches. Despite the decisive score, the team's performance was characterized as "untidy," especially in the initial 30 minutes, where their formidable driving maul faltered and line-outs were disrupted. Coach John Mitchell, while praising the defensive effort, acknowledged shortcomings in attack and continuity, indicating areas that require significant improvement before their quarter-final match against Scotland. This win, though achieving the primary objective of progression, revealed vulnerabilities that top-tier rivals will undoubtedly scrutinize as the tournament progresses into knockout stages.</p>
