          <p>The Trump administration is ending the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, which is half of the total force sent to address protests over immigration policies. The initial deployment was highly controversial, as President Trump federalized the troops, bypassing the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom. Both Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as political theater and are calling for the remaining troops to be sent home immediately. Local officials are framing the withdrawal as a victory achieved through peaceful protest and community unity.</p>

          <p>The National League has won the 2025 MLB All-Star Game in a historic conclusion, defeating the American League in the first-ever swing-off tiebreaker. The game ended in a 6-6 tie after nine innings, with the AL staging a late comeback to force the novel home run derby-style finish. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber was named MVP for his performance in the tiebreaker. The game also marked the debut of the Automated Ball-Strike System, which was successfully challenged by players from both leagues, adding another layer of novelty to the event.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic nomination in the special primary election for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep.

She will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the special general election in September. While the seat is in a heavily Democratic district and is not expected to shift control of the House, its filling will narrow the slim Republican majority.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows the rapid transformation of college athletics since 2021, when rules were relaxed to allow student-athletes to earn money from endorsements and other deals. The executive action comes as a House subcommittee advanced a bill, the 'SCORE Act,' aimed at superseding the current patchwork of state laws governing NIL. The White House is intervening in a complex issue that has significant financial implications for athletes, universities, and the NCAA.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that he says will set a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the U.S. In exchange, Trump stated that American companies would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets.

The Indonesian government has not yet confirmed these terms, and the announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent deal with Vietnam, where officials were reportedly surprised by Trump's description of the terms.

          <p>After a key procedural vote on cryptocurrency regulation failed due to opposition from 13 House Republicans, President Trump held a White House meeting that successfully flipped their votes. Trump announced on Truth Social that the holdouts had agreed to support the rules for debating the bills, including the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins. The initial failure was a rare instance of House Republicans defying Trump's public endorsement of the legislation. The quick reversal highlights the president's significant influence over the Republican conference and puts the crypto-focused bills back on track for a vote.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the 'Genius Act,' a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar.

The legislation would create consumer protections and define which digital currencies qualify as stablecoins, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own.

The piece argues that tailored local laws can create a stable and open system, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since 2015, legislative powers have been expanded to hundreds of Chinese cities. The article suggests that this decentralized approach, moving from top-down orders to a legal framework, is crucial for adapting to local needs and securing long-term economic benefits.</p>

          <p>Central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are increasingly buying gold directly from domestic mines to bolster their reserves as global prices reach new highs. This strategy allows them to acquire the precious metal using local currency, preserving their foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. While this method can be cheaper and supports local industry, it also carries risks if the gold is sourced from small-scale mines with poor labor or environmental practices.
