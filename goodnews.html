          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China Following U.S. Government Assurances</h2>

          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients, stating it has received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, specifically designed to comply with export controls, were unexpectedly halted in April. This development follows increased lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership and had already significantly reduced Nvidia's market share in China. The potential policy shift is seen as a major positive for the company, expected to serve as a new growth catalyst in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, the MLB's home run leader at the All-Star break, won the 2025 Home Run Derby in Atlanta, becoming the first catcher in the event's history to claim the title. Raleigh defeated Tampa Bay Rays' Junior Caminero in the final round with a score of 18-15. The victory, which earned him a $1 million prize, marks a significant moment for the player affectionately known as "Big Dumper" and for the Mariners franchise. The event also featured a memorable 513-foot home run by Pittsburgh Pirates' O'Neil Cruz, showcasing the power on display during the All-Star festivities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 23:00:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and keeping it on track to meet Beijing's annual 5% growth target. This stronger-than-expected performance may reduce immediate pressure on policymakers to introduce significant new stimulus measures. However, the growth rate did slow from the first quarter's 5.4%, and underlying indicators like retail sales and a deepening slump in real estate investment point to potential fragility. While industrial output was strong, officials acknowledged that domestic demand remains insufficient amid an unstable external environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four private astronauts from the Axiom-4 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their 22-hour journey back to Earth. The crew, led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, includes members from India, Poland, and Hungary, who spent 18 days conducting research in microgravity. The mission, organized by Axiom Space in partnership with SpaceX, marks the fourth such commercial flight to the station. The successful departure signifies another milestone for private spaceflight and for the national space programs of India, Poland, and Hungary, which had not sent astronauts to space in over 40 years.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the country. The administrative stay was granted following an emergency motion by the immigration advocacy group Casa, which is challenging the administration's decision to end TPS for both Afghans and Cameroonians. The Department of Homeland Security had argued that conditions in these countries no longer warranted the protection. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for Afghan evacuees as the legal battle over their status continues.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in connection with a bizarre incident where a teddy bear appearing to be made of human skin was left at a Victorville gas station. Authorities determined the macabre object was a prank and that the material was not human remains. The suspect, Hector Corona Villanueva, was arrested on suspicion of filing a false report and planting evidence. A South Carolina artist confirmed she had created the bear and shipped it to a customer in Victorville, stating she was unaware of the buyer's intentions.

          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new technique for manufacturing superalloy turbine discs, a critical component in high-performance aircraft engines. The method involves rapidly cooling the forged metal alloy, which could significantly improve engine power, efficiency, and lifespan. This technological advancement is crucial for China, which is developing next-generation fighter jets and has historically lagged behind the West in advanced aircraft engine technology. The quality of these turbine discs is paramount as they must withstand extreme temperatures, high pressure, and intense rotational speeds inside an engine.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's attorneys argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary, as her full role was not known at the time. An attorney for Epstein's victims stated that Maxwell deserves no protection and should remain imprisoned for her horrific crimes.</p>

          <p>Former Major League Baseball pitcher Daniel Serafini has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the 2021 shooting death of his father-in-law, Robert Gary Spohr. Prosecutors argued the attack was financially motivated, stemming from a dispute over a ranch renovation project. The jury also convicted Serafini of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the initial attack but later died by suicide. Serafini, whose MLB career ended in 2007, now faces a potential life sentence. A second defendant, described as a friend and lover, pleaded guilty to being an accessory in the heinous and calculated crime.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied on Monday, recovering from steep declines late last week. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase plans to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information, raising concerns about increased costs for fintech platforms. However, analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley downplayed the threat, describing the potential impact as negligible for larger firms and far from a business-breaking expense. This reassurance, combined with broader market momentum, helped fuel a recovery in the sector's stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>
