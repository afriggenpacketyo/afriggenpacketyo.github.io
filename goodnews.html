        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department has announced plans to discontinue the production of pennies, citing the rising costs of manufacturing the coin, which now exceed its actual value. The agency's final order for penny blanks has been placed, and the United States Mint is expected to cease penny production in early 2026, resulting in an estimated $56 million in annual savings. The decision follows scrutiny from previous administrations and recent directives from President Trump, who emphasized the wasteful nature of minting pennies that cost more than their face value. This move marks the end of an era for the penny, one of the first coins produced by the U.S. Mint.</p>

          <p>The White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has released a report critiquing chronic disease in America. The report attributes many chronic illnesses to factors like ultra-processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, environmental chemicals, and suggests further studies on childhood vaccines. Kennedy Jr. describes the report as a radical consensus by a government agency on the state of American health. The report lacks specific budget details or policy recommendations, which are expected within the next 100 days, though Kennedy Jr. maintains that addressing these issues would save money in the long term.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation aimed at insulating the security of federal judges from executive branch politics by transferring control of the U.S. Marshals Service to the federal judiciary. The proposed bill seeks to address concerns that political interference could compromise judicial security, especially amid increasing criticism of judges by President Trump and other top government officials. The legislation is modeled after the structure of the U.S. Capitol Police and is intended to ensure that judges receive strong security protections without being subject to potential political pressure from the executive branch.</p>

The US Mint estimates that stopping production will result in an immediate annual saving of $56 million in reduced material costs.

          <p>The House has approved changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Donald Trump's tax package, raising the cap to $40,000. The revised SALT cap phases out over $500,000 in income and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap.

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its stake in Eli Lilly, purchasing 10 additional shares due to a recent decline in the stock price driven by various market concerns. Despite worries about potential tariffs, executive orders targeting drug prices, and competition from Novo Nordisk, the trust believes these headwinds are already factored into the stock's current valuation. The trust cites Eli Lilly's superior GLP-1 medication, Zepbound, and its upcoming oral GLP-1 medication as reasons for continued confidence in the company's growth potential in the fast-growing GLP-1 market.
