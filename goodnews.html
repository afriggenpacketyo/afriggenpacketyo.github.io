          <p>The article discusses the advantages for homeowners who possess 100% home equity, particularly in the current financial climate where interest rates on personal loans and credit cards are high. Having 100% equity, achieved by paying off the mortgage or buying the home with cash, positions homeowners as less risky borrowers, potentially leading to better rate offers and terms on home equity loans and HELOCs. However, lenders typically limit borrowing to 80-90% of the home's value. The article advises homeowners to shop around to compare rates and lenders, and to carefully consider their long-term affordability before borrowing. (not investment advice) Optimism score is based on the general stability of the financial market and availability of borrowing options.</p>

          <p>SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor charge against Llama Productions, a subsidiary of Epic Games, over the use of an AI-powered version of Darth Vader's voice in the video game 'Fortnite'. The actors guild claims that the company replaced the work of human performers with AI technology without proper notice or bargaining. While the estate of James Earl Jones, the original voice actor, had granted permission for the use of his voice in 'Fortnite,' SAG-AFTRA asserts the right to negotiate terms and conditions around the use of AI that replaces the work of its members. This action underscores the ongoing concerns in Hollywood about the impact of AI on actors' jobs and the need for contractual protections.</p>

While the idea is popular, there are concerns about its impact on low-income workers and the restaurant industry. Some argue that the tax cut would primarily benefit middle-income earners and could create wage pressure in the service industry. The article highlights that the proposal is viewed by some as an inefficient means of providing tax relief to working-class households and could add another special tax exemption to the U.S. tax code.
