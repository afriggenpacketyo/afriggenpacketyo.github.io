          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a trade deal, narrowly avoiding a looming tariff deadline. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy. While providing stability, some officials noted the new tariffs will still make transatlantic trade more expensive than before. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's cricket team staged a remarkable defensive performance to secure a draw against England in the fourth Test, keeping the series alive.
