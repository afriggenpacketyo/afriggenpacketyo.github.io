          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:57:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a deal with the Washington Commanders for a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving forward despite recent threats from President Trump to block any such agreement. Trump had demanded the team revert to its former "Redskins" name, a comment the council chairman described as an unhelpful distraction. The proposed deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the district, now faces a council vote in August. The plan aims to bring the NFL team back to D.C. after 30 years in Maryland and has widespread support from local politicians.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read poorly handwritten addresses, the images are sent to a specialized Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. At this facility, hundreds of "data conversion operators" work around the clock to decipher millions of hard-to-read addresses every day, ensuring mail reaches its intended destination. These keyers can process around 900 images per hour, playing a crucial, behind-the-scenes role in the national mail system. If even these experts cannot decode an address, the physical mail piece must be manually inspected as a last resort.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper are both preparing to run for North Carolina's open U.S. Senate seat in 2026. Whatley's potential candidacy has reportedly been endorsed by President Trump, especially after Lara Trump announced she would not be running for the seat being vacated by Republican Thom Tillis. Cooper, a popular former governor, is expected to announce his bid for the Democratic nomination soon. This sets the stage for a high-profile and competitive battleground contest.</p>

          <p>The career of Hulk Hogan, who died at 71, is analyzed as a powerful force that shaped contemporary popular culture, from reality television to political theatrics. The article argues that his persona, whether as the patriotic "Real American" hero or the rebellious "Hollywood" Hogan villain, created a template for modern celebrity brand management and direct-to-audience engagement. Hogan's journey, including his pioneering of reality TV, his successful lawsuit against Gawker, and his public fall from grace over racist comments, mirrors many of the good, bad, and ugly aspects of today's celebrity and media landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at creating new federal rules for the rapidly evolving landscape of college sports, particularly regarding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to ban "pay-for-play" payments while preserving athletes' rights to brand endorsements and directing that revenue-sharing arrangements protect non-revenue and women's sports. It also instructs the National Labor Relations Board to clarify the employment status of college athletes. The move is an attempt to establish federal guardrails over what the White House calls an "out-of-control, rudderless system."</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has announced a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration enforcement raids. The initiative aims to support vulnerable members of its community, whom Archbishop José Gomez described as "good, hard-working" people now living in fear. The program will build on existing parish infrastructure developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and is being funded by donations, including a significant contribution from businessman Rick Caruso. This action follows widespread arrests of undocumented immigrants in the area.</p>

          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to be unofficially underway as several potential Democratic candidates, including Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom, increase their media appearances on non-traditional platforms. This shift in strategy involves engaging with podcasts and shows popular across the ideological spectrum, a tactic seen as a response to the party's 2024 loss. These appearances are also being interpreted as an attempt to signal a rhetorical move toward the center on sensitive cultural topics. The early maneuvering aims to capture the attention of voters, donors, and party elites in a post-2024 leadership vacuum.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft are currently underspending on artificial intelligence, despite plans for massive capital expenditures. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying increased investment to secure a market-leading position, similar to how Google won the search engine race. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased spending on cloud infrastructure, Cramer dismissed Wall Street fears of a poor return on investment. He believes the most accurate AI chatbot will ultimately capture the market and generate enormous profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As regulators, particularly the U.S. FDA, move to ban or phase out artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are racing to develop stable, vibrant natural alternatives. Companies like French firm Fermentalg are using microalgae to produce a new blue pigment, while others source colors from specially grown carrots and potatoes. The challenge for these firms is to create natural dyes that are as vivid and long-lasting as their synthetic counterparts. Major food giants including Kellogg's, Nestle, and Kraft Heinz have all pledged to reformulate their products to eliminate artificial dyes.</p>
