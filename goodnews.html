          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, a decorated all-Black infantry regiment from World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. This honor recognizes their valiant service, which was largely ignored for decades due to racial discrimination within the segregated U.S. military at the time. The ceremony occurs amid ongoing national debates about the interpretation and remembrance of American history, with speakers highlighting the soldiers' fight for freedom abroad while being denied it at home. The medal will be housed at the Smithsonian Institution for public display and research.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the U.S. government its largest single shareholder. This rare move converts grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, aiming to strengthen domestic production of advanced microchips amid intense competition with China and the race for AI dominance. The investment is intended to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC, mitigating risks from potential geopolitical supply shocks. While analysts see it as a strategic move, experts also note the risks of government intervention in business decisions and potential political fallout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent gathering of Asian powers, including China, Russia, and India, highlighted a cooperative political and strategic intent but lacked a foundational economic agreement akin to the Bretton Woods system. This article argues that for a new world order to emerge, declarative summits are insufficient; complex institutions governing monetary policy, trade, and development are necessary to prevent global fragmentation into competing blocs. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which now includes 27 members and partners, is positioned to add significant weight to such an initiative. However, the immense challenge of creating these new systems remains a pivotal, unaddressed issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito of Japan, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has marked his official entry into adulthood with a coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status underscores the ongoing debate about Japan's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the imperial family faces a critical shortage of successors, reflecting Japan's broader demographic challenges. The ceremony has renewed public discussion over whether the rules should be changed to allow women to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is shadowed by political pressure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has denounced the movement's "globalist uniformity" and echoes the Nazi-era condemnation of its work as "degenerate art." The Bauhaus Dessau Foundation's director expressed concern over the attacks but noted they have also brought widespread support for the institution. The centennial's theme explores the movement's foundational materials and its community spirit, while also critically examining their ethical origins.</p>

          <p>This article offers a personal account of becoming a Buffalo Bills fan and discovering the deep connection between the team and the city's identity. The author describes how supporting the Bills provides a metaphor for Buffalo itself—a city with a history of resilience, striving for success that often remains just out of reach. This shared experience of hope and near-misses, like the four consecutive Super Bowl losses in the 1990s, fosters an exceptionally strong and positive community bond among fans. For the author, who previously had no interest in sports, being welcomed into this fandom provided a powerful sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>The board of directors at Tesla has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade if he meets a series of aggressive growth targets, including increasing the company's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. According to a regulatory filing, the plan is designed to incentivize Musk to remain with the company and transform it into an AI and robotics leader, as he has reportedly threatened to leave otherwise.

          <p>Scotland's national football team began its World Cup qualification campaign with a valuable draw against group rivals Denmark in Copenhagen. Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work rate and combative performance, which earned them a crucial point on the road against the group's highest-ranked team.

The result puts pressure on Denmark ahead of their next match and positions Scotland favorably as they prepare to face Belarus, with hopes of building early momentum in their bid to reach a World Cup.</p>

          <p>The article commemorates the 30th anniversary of one of football's most iconic moments: Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita's "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. On September 6, 1995, Higuita cleared a shot by arching his body forward and kicking the ball away with his heels, a move he had developed while filming a commercial. The audacious act cemented the legacy of "El Loco" (The Madman), a goalkeeper already known for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring ability, and playing far outside his penalty area. His career was as colorful off the pitch, including a prison sentence.</p>

The 21-year-old's rapid rise has been marked by early success, including making her debut for Canada's national team at just 15. Despite the immense pressure and a career that has already taken her through university, Portuguese, and English leagues, former coaches describe her as humble, driven, and unchanged by her fame. Her record-breaking transfer fee is seen as a major milestone in the rapid commercial growth of the women's game.</p>

The race to finance and develop this infrastructure is not merely about logistics but is a strategic effort by these global powers to secure their supply chains.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the administration from ending legal protections that allow them to live and work in the U.S. due to dangerous conditions in their home countries. The judge criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision as "arbitrary and capricious," stating it exceeded her authority and ignored the dire situations in both nations. This decision provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands who were facing deportation and loss of work authorization.</p>
