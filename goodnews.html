        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The ruling comes after Cook filed a lawsuit challenging her termination, which Trump initiated based on allegations of mortgage fraud from before her time at the Fed. Judge Jia Cobb's decision emphasized the public interest in Federal Reserve independence, suggesting that the "for cause" provision for removing a governor likely applies only to conduct during their term in office. This legal battle highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and the central bank over its autonomy and monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, which includes restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, announced after a meeting in Cairo, is described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as "a step in the right direction." This development comes after Iran suspended cooperation with inspectors in July and amid a recent push by European nations to reimpose UN sanctions. While details are limited, Iran stated the agreement addresses its security concerns but warned it would be terminated if any "hostile act," such as new sanctions, were imposed.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, should host the 2036 Summer Olympics. The author argues that the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network would mitigate the immense economic burden typically associated with hosting the Games. By utilizing pre-built venues and temporary structures, the area could avoid the debt and underused infrastructure that often plagues host cities. The piece suggests the area's robust and expanding transit system is uniquely capable of meeting logistical challenges, such as housing all athletes within a short commute.</p>

          <h2>Pitcher Roki Sasaki's Strong Rehab Performance Revives Dodgers' Postseason Roster Hopes</h2>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-entered the conversation for a spot on the team's postseason roster after a dominant rehab performance for the Triple-A Oklahoma City team. In his start, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and his fastball topped 100 mph multiple times, a significant improvement over his previous struggles during his recovery from a shoulder impingement. While a starting role is unlikely, manager Dave Roberts acknowledged that a bullpen role is now a possibility for the 23-year-old. The strong outing presents a welcome but difficult decision for the Dodgers as they finalize their pitching staff for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the legality of President Trump's broad-based tariffs, setting the stage for a major showdown over executive power and economic policy. The court will review lower court decisions that found the president exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the duties. The Trump administration argues that this authority is crucial for national security and foreign policy negotiations. This case marks the first time the Supreme Court will directly adjudicate one of Trump's second-term policies, with arguments scheduled for the first week of November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a congressional seat in Northern Virginia, formerly held by the late Representative Gerry Connolly. Walkinshaw, a Fairfax County supervisor and Connolly's former chief of staff, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in the reliably Democratic district. His victory will narrow the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213. The race was influenced by local concerns over federal job cuts initiated by the Trump administration, an issue of high importance in a district where many residents are employed by the federal government.</p>

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed on over 1,000 people across the UK, a move that could revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed. The test measures a protein called p-tau217, which indicates the presence of the amyloid and tau protein buildups associated with Alzheimer's. Scientists at University College London, who are leading the study, believe the test can improve diagnostic accuracy from around 70% to over 90%. If successful, this less invasive test could replace expensive PET scans or lumbar punctures, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses.</p>

          <p>New Mexico has announced it will become the first state in the nation to provide free, universal childcare for all of its residents, regardless of income. The initiative, which begins November 1st, is an expansion of an existing program that offered no-cost care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level. The previous program was credited with helping to lower the state's poverty rate by increasing workforce participation and raising wages for childcare providers. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's office stated the expansion will save families an average of $12,000 per child annually.</p>

This transformation was achieved without a budget increase and was guided by feedback gathered from directly engaging with passengers.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed scrapping the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping a card. Under the new plans, banks and card providers would be able to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. The move reflects the increasing popularity of contactless payments but has raised concerns about fraud.
