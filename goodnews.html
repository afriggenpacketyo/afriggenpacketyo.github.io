        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental innings of 269 from captain Shubman Gill. His epic score, the highest by an Indian captain in Test history, propelled India to a massive first-innings total of 587. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 77-3 by the close of day two. After their comeback victory in the first Test, England now faces an immense challenge to avoid defeat as India's bowlers found significant movement to dismiss key batters early.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' predictions. According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate also fell to a new low of 4.1%. Job growth was primarily driven by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw continued cuts. Despite this positive report, economists remain cautious, expecting growth to slow in the second half of the year due to uncertainty over tariffs, which may lead the Federal Reserve to hold off on interest rate cuts.

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen for the fifth straight week, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.67%, offering a potential opening for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend could continue, as markets anticipate the Federal Reserve may cut its benchmark rate later this year. The article suggests that current buyers should prepare for a potentially more competitive market by taking immediate steps. These include checking their credit reports for accuracy, researching and selecting a qualified real estate agent, and getting pre-approved for a mortgage to strengthen their position when making offers.

          <h2>Documentary on Chef Nobu Matsuhisa Focuses More on Brand than Culinary Art</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" explores the life and career of famed sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film is critiqued for emphasizing his global brand over his culinary genius. The review notes that the most compelling scenes show Matsuhisa's meticulous demand for quality and co-founder Robert De Niro's concerns about rapid expansion. However, much of the film follows a standard biographical format, tracing his humble beginnings and early struggles. While the food looks delicious, the documentary is said to lack in-depth analysis of his innovative techniques, feeling more like a commercial for the high-end restaurant chain.</p>

          <p>Actor John Leguizamo is launching the second season of his docuseries, "Leguizamo Does America," which explores the contributions of Latino communities across the U.S. The new season, premiering on MSNBC, arrives in a changed political landscape under the Trump administration, a context Leguizamo describes as heartbreakingly cruel toward Latinos. The series, which will visit cities like Philadelphia and Phoenix, aims to serve as an "antidote" to the erasure of Latinos by highlighting their history and success. The show continues Leguizamo's long-standing effort to increase Latino visibility and representation in media.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article outlines five key indicators that suggest an individual's credit card debt has become too substantial for a do-it-yourself payoff plan. These warning signs include consistently failing to pay more than the minimum due, having a credit utilization ratio that exceeds 50%, and using credit cards to cover essential living expenses. Other red flags are a debt-to-income ratio surpassing 40% and being unable to qualify for reasonable debt consolidation loans. When these signs are present, it is often necessary to seek professional help through options like credit counseling or debt settlement programs. (not investment advice)</p>
