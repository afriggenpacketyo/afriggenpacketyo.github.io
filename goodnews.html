          <p>Downtown Los Angeles restaurants are facing challenges in filling their dining rooms despite the recent lifting of a curfew enacted to quell demonstrations. The curfew and media portrayal of downtown as unsafe have led to a significant drop in reservations for restaurants, with some experiencing losses of up to 80%. Local organizations are urging residents to support downtown businesses, emphasizing that the area is safe. While some restaurants are seeing signs of recovery, many continue to struggle with the lingering effects of the curfew and negative perceptions. </p>

          <p>Fox Corp. has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to expand its sports programming and attract more customers to its streaming services.

          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to twice as many households this winter. Anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the discount, regardless of property size. The cost of the expansion could be covered by raising fees on all customer bills, though the government aims to offset this through savings by energy suppliers. While welcomed by debt charities, some argue the scheme still excludes those most at risk, such as those on non-means tested benefits. </p>

          <p>In an era marked by heightened polarization and constant online interactions, people are both too offensive and too easily offended, according to recent studies. Rather than trying to control others' behavior, individuals should focus on managing their own reactions to provocations. Effective strategies include laughing off minor offenses, utilizing the prefrontal cortex to inhibit primal reactions, and tuning out sources of excessive outrage. Recognizing the psychological and neurological mechanisms behind taking offense can empower individuals to respond more constructively. </p>

          <p>Olga Khazan, a staff writer, undertook a project to change her personality, inspired by research showing that people can shift even core aspects of themselves. She focused on improving her extroversion and reducing her neuroticism, signing up for improv classes, meditation lessons, and social activities. The experiment resulted in significant changes, with Khazan increasing her extroversion score and lowering her neuroticism. She argues that personality traits are tools that can help individuals get more out of life, and that she found the exercise helped her become less isolated. </p>
