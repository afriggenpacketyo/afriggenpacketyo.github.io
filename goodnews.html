        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports that Romania's ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship played a crucial role in the election of Nicusor Dan as president, voting in large numbers to support his pro-European stance. These voters, estimated to be between 500,000 and 700,000, rejected the hard-right candidate George Simion, who had anti-minority views and was backed by Hungarian PM Viktor Orban. The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) also opposed Orban's recommendation to vote for Simion, marking a shift in their relationship. Dan's victory is seen as a win for liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic path, highlighting the importance of minority groups in shaping political outcomes.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate crowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to treat individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing pressure on emergency services. While the scheme is expected to expand nationally, some experts express skepticism and call for robust testing and better funding for NHS mental health services.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the bloc's commitment to securing a trade deal with the United States based on "respect" rather than "threats," following US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect and that the EU stands ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More and more Japanese people, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting" their jobs, opting for a better work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, these workers prioritize personal time and are less willing to sacrifice their lives for the company. This shift is attributed to factors such as the desire for more "me time," disillusionment with traditional corporate loyalty, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts view this trend as a positive change, potentially leading to happier individuals and a more balanced society.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices for consumers amid soaring costs. The goal is to make rice available in stores at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms, with the reserve rice expected to reach shelves in June. The government will initially release 300,000 tons and may provide additional supplies if necessary. The move comes amid criticism that the government has failed to curb a spike in rice prices, impacting households as inflation outpaces wage growth.</p>
