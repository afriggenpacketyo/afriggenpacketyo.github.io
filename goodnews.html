        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in surprisingly little widespread damage and no reported deaths outside the immediate area. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. While the event triggered extensive alerts, experts consider it a "best-case scenario" for a quake of this magnitude, highlighting the critical role of location and directionality in a tsunami's impact.</p>
