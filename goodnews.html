          <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's Potential Return to US Soccer Viewed as a Strategic Move for FIFA and Trump's World Cup</h2>

          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo may return to play in the United States for the first time in over a decade, a development seen as significant for the upcoming World Cup hosted in the country. Portugal is reportedly in talks for a friendly match against the US, which would mark Ronaldo's first appearance since facing sexual assault allegations in Las Vegas, a case that has since been dismissed. The article suggests his return could be linked to the current political climate under Donald Trump, who has previously shown affinity for the star. This move could serve as a major endorsement for the US as a safe and welcoming host for the global tournament, energizing both the event and Ronaldo's brand.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have returned to Tokyo, with Japan winning its first medal in the 35km race walk on the opening day. The event was marked by grueling conditions, with temperatures reaching 30°C and humidity over 90%, described by the men's winner as "absolutely brutal." Despite the challenges, the championships have been met with enthusiasm from local supporters, who are filling the stands four years after the Tokyo Olympics were held without spectators due to the pandemic. The return of a live audience marks a significant moment for the host nation, with nearly 500,000 tickets sold for the nine-day event.</p>

          <p>The Corona Centennial Huskies defeated the nation's top-ranked high school football team, Mater Dei, in a dramatic 43-36 upset. Centennial dominated the first half, leading 33-7, largely due to Mater Dei's numerous turnovers. However, Mater Dei staged a massive comeback in the third quarter, scoring 29 unanswered points to take the lead. Centennial rallied in the final quarter, securing the win with a late touchdown and a game-clinching interception. The victory marks the first time in a decade that a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco has beaten Mater Dei, shaking up the Southern California high school football landscape.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is enjoying a significant revival, shedding its old-fashioned image to become a popular trend among younger generations, largely thanks to TikTok and the resurgence of country-pop music. Enthusiasts note that the dance style, once associated mainly with older people in village halls, now attracts teenagers and young adults to classes and events. The trend has been fueled by mainstream artists like Sabrina Carpenter and viral social media dances, making "country cool again." Modern line dancing is also more diverse, with routines set to a wide range of music genres, from Metallica to Ed Sheeran, broadening its appeal.</p>

The e-commerce platform JD.com reported that sales in the first minute surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused temporary issues with Apple's official website, and in-store pickup appointments in major cities like Shanghai were fully booked within minutes. As of Saturday morning, customers in Guangzhou faced waiting periods extending into mid-October, highlighting the continued strength of the Apple brand in the competitive Chinese market.</p>

          <p>American businesswoman Michele Kang is making a dramatic impact on women's soccer through her ownership of the London City Lionesses, now in the Women's Super League. Kang employs a hands-on, multi-club ownership model, which also includes Washington Spirit and Lyon, to build scale and invest heavily in infrastructure, player recruitment, and female-specific research. She argues this model is a necessity for the growth of the women's game, which currently lacks the massive media and sponsorship deals of men's football. Her investment has already attracted high-profile players and aims to elevate the entire fan experience, challenging the notion that women's teams need a men's club affiliation to succeed.</p>

Students from across the political spectrum told the BBC they feel a responsibility to ensure that dialogue continues, viewing the attack as an assault on free expression itself. Some students, previously apolitical, have been galvanized into action, while others who disagreed with Kirk's views still defended his right to speak. The event has transformed the campus into a focal point of America's political divide, with many students determined to prevent violence from silencing discourse.</p>

The unbeaten American is aiming to become the first male boxer in the modern era to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes.

          <p>China's retail market is being transformed by a fierce "instant commerce" war between giants like Alibaba and Meituan, leading to heavy subsidies and ultra-fast delivery for consumers.

The competition has driven down prices significantly, with some meal deals costing as little as one US dollar.
