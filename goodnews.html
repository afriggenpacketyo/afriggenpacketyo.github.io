          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border management tool, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will affect non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires passengers to register biometric data like fingerprints and a facial photo upon their first entry into the Schengen Area. While designed to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial registration phase. The EES is being phased in over six months, with full implementation across all 29 participating countries expected by April 2026.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the next World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to rectify the team's failure to defeat Ukraine in the 2022 playoffs. Clarke, who successfully led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, still feels the sting of the 3-1 loss at Hampden that ended their hopes for a spot in Qatar. He emphasized that while the defeat was a significant disappointment, especially given the unusual circumstances of the rescheduled match, the team is now focused on putting that result right in the current campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein has sparked a public debate over religious holidays after it formalized the option for Muslim students and employees to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic festivals. Despite media headlines suggesting new entitlements, the regulation merely clarifies an existing practice rooted in Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom, similar to provisions for other non-Christian faiths. The policy does not grant extra paid holidays but allows individuals to observe significant religious days without penalty. This reflects a broader national conversation in Germany about integration and equality in a culturally diverse society.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has identified the genetic process that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. The research, published in the journal Cell, explains the phenomenon of somatic embryogenesis, where non-reproductive plant cells can be reprogrammed to form an embryo. The study found that flipping two specific genetic switches is the key to initiating this profound biological process. This discovery deepens the understanding of plant development and could have significant implications for agriculture and biotechnology.</p>

          <p>A review of several major striker signings from the recent Premier League transfer window reveals a mixed bag of early-season performances. While some, like Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike, have made an immediate impact with crucial goals, others are still finding their footing. Alexander Isak's record-breaking move to Liverpool has started slowly, while Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko is beginning to score after a difficult start. The article analyzes the statistics of nine prominent forwards, assessing how they have fared after the first seven league matches and whether they are living up to their significant transfer fees.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, decided to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen produced a documentary at Cardiff University's anatomy centre to learn about the process and its importance for training future doctors. The program reveals how medical students learn from real bodies, which they call their "silent teachers," and how families navigate the extended grieving process. Inspired by her mother's desire to give back to the medical community that treated her for cancer, Owen has also decided to become a body donor herself.</p>

          <p>Boxer Jaron "Boots" Ennis delivered a stunning performance in his junior middleweight debut, defeating Uisma Lima with a technical knockout in just 118 seconds. Ennis dropped Lima three times in the first round before the referee stopped the fight, securing his 35th professional victory in front of a hometown Philadelphia crowd. The dominant win signals Ennis's strength at the new 154lb weight class after previously struggling to make the 147lb welterweight limit. The victory sets up a highly anticipated future bout against fellow undefeated fighter Vergil Ortiz Jr., which is expected to take place in early 2026.</p>

          <p>Footballer Fran Kirby has opened up about her challenging journey back to professional sports after being diagnosed with pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the heart. The condition, which caused extreme chest pain and fatigue, led to her collapsing in 2019 and forced a 10-month hiatus from her career. Kirby described the difficult recovery process, which involved strong medication and overcoming severe exhaustion, as a "real eye-opener" that gave her a new appreciation for her health. Since her return, she has been more cautious about rest and recovery, managing a successful career with Brighton and the England national team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being the all-time leading goalscorer for both England and Tottenham Hotspur, and continuing his prolific form at Bayern Munich, questions persist about whether striker Harry Kane receives the appreciation he deserves. Kane recently became the fastest player to score 100 goals for a single club in Europe's top five leagues. While some critics point to his lack of major trophies or suggest his international record is inflated by qualifiers, many pundits and former players argue he is a complete, world-class talent. His humility and low-key profile may contribute to him being less celebrated than other global superstars with comparable statistics.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion in loans for the Standard Gauge Railway project from U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan, a move expected to save the country US$215 million in annual debt-servicing costs. The original loans were taken from the Export-Import Bank of China to fund the railway from Mombasa to Naivasha. This currency swap is anticipated to significantly reduce the interest rate on the remaining debt. Analysts suggest this financial strategy could serve as a model for other debt-distressed African nations and may strengthen their economic ties with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walk-on running back King Miller had a breakout performance, rushing for 148 yards to lead the USC Trojans to a decisive 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan. Miller, a redshirt freshman, stepped up after USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries. His long, breakaway runs in the third quarter were instrumental in securing the win, which marks a significant achievement for coach Lincoln Riley against a ranked opponent. The victory was defined by USC's physical dominance on both the offensive and defensive lines, challenging perceptions of the team's toughness.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series, a team that has excelled this season despite a modest payroll. The Brewers' success is built on a small-ball offensive approach that prioritizes getting on base and manufacturing runs, rather than relying on home runs. Their pitching staff ranked second in the majors in team ERA, anchored by ace Freddy Peralta and a deep, effective bullpen. Managed by former college coach Pat Murphy, the Brewers swept the Dodgers in six games during the regular season, presenting a formidable challenge for Los Angeles.</p>
