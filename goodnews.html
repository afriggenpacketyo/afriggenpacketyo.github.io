          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, which are crucial for telecommunications, electronics, and aerospace industries. The nation has also substantially increased its investment in mineral exploration for other key elements like tin, copper, and tungsten. These efforts are part of a strategic push to enhance national resource security amid the global race for critical minerals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a tentative ruling that would order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests as part of its mass deportation plan. The lawsuit, filed by civil rights groups, argues that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned individuals without probable cause, creating fear and harming the local community. During a hearing, the judge questioned the government's lack of specific evidence to justify its agents' actions and appeared unpersuaded by their general declarations. A final order is expected soon, which could significantly impact federal immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in a seven-mile-long wastewater tunnel under construction, with the collapse happening far from the single access point. A large-scale response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, facilitated the rescue, and remarkably, none of the workers sustained visible injuries. The project has been put on hold as Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the scope of nationwide injunctions, but the lawsuit was structured to comply with the new standards. The White House has criticized the ruling as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court and vowed to fight it.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Bianchi, 74, was part of a duo with his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., responsible for the murder and sexual assault of at least 12 women in the Los Angeles area during the 1970s. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the parole board determined he remains a risk and will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Buono died in prison in 2002 after being sentenced to life without parole.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite named NWA 16788, with an expected price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock, which represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe an asteroid strike dislodged it from Mars, sending it on a 140-million-mile journey to Earth. This rare object provides a massive dataset for scientists and offers a unique opportunity for a collector to own a significant piece of the red planet.</p>

          <p>Prominent investor Cathie Wood recently reaffirmed her strong belief in Tesla, dismissing concerns over CEO Elon Musk's political activities and emphasizing his renewed focus on the company's core business. She reiterated her prediction that Tesla's stock could reach $2,600 if its robotaxi venture succeeds. In contrast, Wood raised questions about Apple's position in the artificial intelligence race, citing the departure of a key AI executive and the company's decision to discontinue its self-driving car project. She suggested the tech giant needs to prove it can still lead in major technological disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science made an exceptionally rare discovery by finding a dinosaur fossil deep beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped vertebra, believed to be from a small, plant-eating dinosaur from 67.5 million years ago, was found in a narrow core sample drilled over 750 feet deep. Museum officials described the find as incredibly unlikely, comparing it to a "hole in one from the moon." While not visually spectacular, the fossil is now on display, representing Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery to date.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day the tech company's market valuation closed above $4 trillion for the first time. The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration has restricted sales of certain processors for national security reasons, a move Huang has previously stated effectively closed the $50 billion Chinese market to the company. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, linking it to his administration's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are operational again after being knocked down by high winds 14 months ago. Hundreds of onlookers gathered to watch the iconic blades start turning, an event celebrated with a can-can performance by 60 dancers and a rooftop fireworks display. The collapse in April 2024 was caused by a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed for the Olympics, a motor delay kept them stationary. The restoration returns a beloved symbol of Parisian nightlife to its full glory.</p>

          <p>A political strategist claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. The research identified eight words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. These words are described as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies, from Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" to Labour's single-word "Change" campaign. The article also notes that the future of slogans may shift as AI allows for more personalized messaging to individual voters.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to expand its Robotaxi operations to Phoenix, Arizona, applying for state approval to test and deploy its autonomous vehicles there. This move would follow competitor Waymo, which already operates a large driverless robotaxi fleet in the Phoenix area. Tesla recently began a pilot program in Austin, Texas, using Model Y vehicles with human safety supervisors on board, though the initial rollout has seen some documented incidents. The expansion into a new market signals Tesla's push to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space using its camera-based technology.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry even as it holds the record for the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. Experts attribute this to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning, often delaying childbirth for financial and career reasons. This trend offers a glimmer of hope for the nation's demographic crisis, contributing to a slight, first-in-nine-years increase in the birth rate.</p>

Gass explained that the company has already factored tariffs into its financial guidance and is working with its vendors and managing its own costs to protect consumers from price increases. The comments came as Levi's reported strong quarterly earnings and raised its full-year guidance, driven by high demand in Europe.</p>
