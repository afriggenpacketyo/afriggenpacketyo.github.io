          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government after his 2022 election loss, facing charges that include plotting a coup and forming a criminal organization. The case is considered a pivotal test for Brazil's democratic institutions, which emerged from a military dictatorship just 40 years ago. The proceedings have drawn international attention, with former U.S. President Trump, a supporter of Bolsonaro, calling the trial a "witch hunt" and reportedly attempting to intervene.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have arrested three Sydney dockworkers in connection with the seizure of 1,116 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $107 million. The drugs were discovered hidden behind a false wall in a shipping container that had arrived from Europe. Police allege the men were "trusted insiders" who used their positions to facilitate the importation for organized crime groups. The arrests are part of a multi-agency operation targeting corruption within Australia's critical supply chains.</p>

          <p>Scientists are intensifying their search for what they call "dark taxa," which are groups of organisms, mostly small insects and fungi, where the vast majority of species are unknown to science. It is estimated that up to 90% of all life on Earth has yet to be discovered, and these tiny creatures play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. Thanks to advances in DNA sequencing technology, researchers are now able to identify new species at an unprecedented rate, heralding a new "Golden Age" of biological discovery.</p>

          <p>At the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China advocated for its vision of a new global security and economic order, presenting an alternative to Western dominance. The bloc's joint declaration emphasized multilateralism and an open global economy, seen as a thinly veiled critique of U.S. tariffs. The attendance of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was particularly noteworthy, signaling a potential realignment, although India stopped short of endorsing China's Belt and Road Initiative, indicating continued caution.</p>
