          <p>Representative Sara Jacobs argues that military families deserve comprehensive in vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage, citing the higher rates of infertility among service members due to the physical and emotional demands of their service. She highlights the financial burden of IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and introduces the "IVF for Military Families Act" to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment. Jacobs criticizes the lack of Republican support for the bill and urges President Trump to support military families by expanding IVF coverage, emphasizing that military families have earned and deserve this access to reproductive care. </p>
