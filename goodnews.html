          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment comes as a surprise, given the insurer's recent challenges, including a 50% stock decline in 2025 and a Justice Department investigation. The move, potentially orchestrated by Buffett's investment lieutenants, aligns with Berkshire's history of value investing in embattled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock saw a significant 6% increase in extended trading, signaling renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI software company Palantir has experienced a remarkable 1,700% surge since its 2020 public debut, recently surpassing a $430 billion market valuation. A significant driver of this growth has been U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its massive valuation, Palantir's revenue is a fraction of its megacap tech peers, leading to a high forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280. The stock's strength is also bolstered by strong retail investor interest, who poured $1.2 billion into the company last month. (not investment advice)</p>

He had previously announced a surprising departure from rugby in January 2024 to pursue a career in the NFL through its international player pathway program. After brief stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars, he failed to secure a spot and has now opted to resume his rugby career.

          <p>Retirees can strategically own multiple annuities to diversify their income streams and balance financial goals, though this approach adds complexity. Combining different types, such as fixed and variable annuities, can provide both guaranteed income for essential expenses and potential for market-linked growth. However, this strategy requires careful coordination of liquidity, as each contract has unique surrender periods and withdrawal rules. It is also crucial to manage the nuanced tax implications and increased paperwork, making professional financial advice highly recommended for effective implementation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending more aggressive and earlier treatment. A key change is the new recommendation to abstain from alcohol, as mounting evidence shows its negative impact on blood pressure. The guidelines now suggest that individuals with systolic pressure between 130-139 should first try lifestyle changes, but begin medication if levels don't improve within three to six months. The update also places greater emphasis on blood pressure control to reduce the risk of dementia and for those who are pregnant.</p>

          <h2>Home Equity Loan and HELOC Rates Continue to Decline, Prompting Borrower Decisions</h2>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and HELOCs have seen another slight decrease, continuing a recent downward trend. This sustained decline, coupled with record-high home equity levels, presents an attractive borrowing opportunity for many homeowners. For those considering a variable-rate HELOC, waiting for further rate drops is unnecessary, as future cuts would automatically apply. However, for fixed-rate home equity loans, waiting could potentially allow borrowers to lock in a lower rate, though this involves uncertainty about future market movements.

          <p>Intel's stock price increased by 7% following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. This potential investment would align with the administration's goal of boosting domestic manufacturing of critical technologies like advanced semiconductors. The government's capital could help fund Intel's new factory construction in Ohio, reinforcing the company's position as a key U.S. chip manufacturer. The move is part of a broader trend of the U.S. government taking direct financial stakes in strategic industries to advance national and economic security interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Depositing $50,000 into a high-yield savings account can generate significant returns, with current top rates around 4.35% yielding over $2,100 in interest annually. This earning potential is vastly superior to traditional savings accounts, which currently offer an average rate of just 0.38%. While rates on high-yield accounts are variable and likely to decrease following anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, savers can still benefit substantially by acting now. Experts suggest that even with potential future reductions, the immediate impact on savings rates will likely be muted, making it a favorable time to open an account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argues that despite recent inflation data, monetary policy remains restrictive and that a significant rate reduction could stimulate the labor market and create jobs. Zervos joins a growing list of potential Fed nominees who believe the central bank should act decisively to ease its policy. He also expressed that having more market-savvy individuals involved in monetary policy decisions would be a significant benefit for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing body of research suggests a strong link between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and the rising incidence of colon cancer, especially in younger people. Scientists have found that tumors are fueled by inflammatory compounds common in such foods, while lacking the healing compounds found in healthy alternatives. Diets rich in leafy greens, fish, and avocados provide bioactive lipids that help resolve inflammation. This research could pave the way for new cancer treatment strategies that focus on diet and natural healing processes to supplement traditional therapies.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point since October 2024, providing some relief for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. While significant drops are not expected, further declines could be on the horizon. Key dates to watch in September include the release of the unemployment report on the 5th and the inflation report on the 11th, as these economic indicators will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's next move. The Fed's policy meeting concluding on September 17th will be the most critical event, with any decision on interest rates directly impacting the mortgage market.</p>
