          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 19:16:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only mandated for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve, a move praised by campaigners and support organizations. The new law, which will provide for at least one week of leave, aims to formally acknowledge the significant emotional impact of early pregnancy loss for both parents.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 19:16:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to offer early years teachers tax-free payments of £4,500 to attract and retain them in nurseries located in disadvantaged areas. This initiative is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at narrowing the educational attainment gap among preschool children. The plan also includes more frequent Ofsted inspections for nurseries. While the government says the strategy will give young children the best start, critics argue that other tax changes have negatively impacted the financial stability of childcare providers across the country.</p>

          <p>Marking the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, King Charles has released a message calling for national unity against those who seek to create division. He condemned the "senseless acts of evil" that killed 52 people in 2005 and praised the spirit of solidarity that emerged in the aftermath. The King's message emphasized the importance of building a society where all faiths can coexist with mutual respect and understanding. Commemorative events, including a national service at St Paul's Cathedral, are being held to remember the victims of the coordinated terrorist attacks on the city's public transport system.</p>
