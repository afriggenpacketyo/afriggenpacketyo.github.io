          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to Iran, emphasizing Trump's consistent stance against Iranian nuclear weapons development. Vance highlighted Trump's openness to a deal preventing uranium enrichment and alluded to potential further actions if Iran violates non-proliferation obligations. His comments come amidst growing divisions among Trump's supporters, including Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, regarding U.S. involvement in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance assured that Trump is focused on using the American military solely to achieve American goals. The article underscores the administration's commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons amid internal and external pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked-choice voting in its mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If a candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second-choice votes from their ballots are then allocated. This process continues until two candidates remain, with the leading candidate declared the winner. The system has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a specific candidate, like former Governor Andrew Cuomo, from winning. This is the second time New York City has used ranked-choice voting citywide.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering adjustments to the tax bill, a key part of President Trump's second-term agenda, potentially leading to disagreements with the House. The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text addressing Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. The Senate plan makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent but differs from the House version on issues like state and local tax deductions (SALT), the debt limit, and green energy rollbacks. These differences could threaten the delicate coalition needed to pass the bill in both chambers.</p>

AWS aims to reduce AI training costs and provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs through Project Rainier, an AI supercomputer built for Anthropic. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, powered by over half a million of the chips, an order that would have traditionally gone to Nvidia.</p>

The Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of politicizing economic and technological issues, rejecting claims that Huawei's equipment poses a national security threat. This response follows the U.S. embassy in Panama's announcement of an $8 million initiative to replace Huawei equipment with "secure American technology" at 13 sites.

The incident occurred during discussions about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer described as a "huge relief" for workers at Jaguar Land Rover and their supply chain.

The companies challenge whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants the president the authority to impose tariffs. They argue that neither the Constitution nor IEEPA allows the president to levy tariffs at all, claiming that the tariffs are an "unbearable" tax increase. The companies are seeking a decision during a special September sitting or in October.</p>
