          <p>Comcast has reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, leading to a rise in its stock price. This positive performance occurred despite a continued loss of broadband customers, a challenge the company is addressing with a new market strategy. The company's overall net income saw a significant boost from the sale of its stake in Hulu to Disney. While the traditional pay-TV business declined, growth in the film studios, theme parks, and the Peacock streaming service helped offset these losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following her 2024 election loss, Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California, a decision that has significant implications for the state's political landscape and her own future. In her statement, Harris acknowledged that the Democratic party's traditional playbook has often failed, suggesting a need for new methods to address the country's challenges. Her choice leaves the gubernatorial race wide open and fuels speculation about her next steps, which could include starting a non-profit or focusing on helping Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections. Allies suggest she aims to remain a central figure in rebuilding the party.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the foundational principles of the United States as the nation approaches its 250th anniversary on July 4, 2026. It emphasizes that America was founded on ideals of liberty and equality, as articulated in the Declaration of Independence, rather than on shared ethnicity or territory. The author argues for the importance of civic renewal and reconnecting with this shared history to overcome contemporary divisions. The piece calls for a recommitment to the ongoing, imperfect work of forming a more perfect union, urging citizens to understand their role in sustaining democracy.</p>

          <p>Moderna and BioNTech, the two companies that became famous for their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, are now taking distinctly different paths for their futures. Moderna is doubling down on its mRNA technology, investing its pandemic earnings into a broad pipeline of vaccines for other viruses like flu and RSV. In contrast, Germany-based BioNTech has used its windfall to diversify through acquisitions, notably moving into promising new cancer drug technologies. This strategic divergence is reflected in their stock performance, with investors showing more confidence in BioNTech's broader, less risky approach compared to Moderna's focused but more volatile vaccine-centric model.

The new laws also make permanent several tax benefits, such as allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans and expanding the saver's credit.

          <p>As climate change leads to increasingly hotter summers, experts advise on how to manage the negative effects of extreme heat on both physical and mental well-being. High temperatures can cause heat-related illnesses and also contribute to irritability, agitation, and a form of seasonal affective disorder. To cope, it is recommended to stay indoors in air conditioning during peak heat, adjust exercise routines to early mornings, and stay hydrated. Psychologists also suggest being mindful of heat's impact on mood, avoiding major decisions on hot days, and maintaining social connections, even if it means moving traditional outdoor activities indoors to stay safe.</p>

          <p>In a significant late-stage trial, Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro has shown positive cardiovascular outcomes when compared directly against Trulicity, the company's older treatment. The study's main goal was to prove Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity for patients with Type 2 diabetes and existing heart disease, a benchmark it successfully met. Mounjaro also demonstrated superior results in other areas, including a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and better kidney protection. These results strengthen the case for Mounjaro to become the preferred first-line treatment for this high-risk patient population as Trulicity nears its patent expiration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CVS Health delivered second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions, prompting the company to raise its full-year profit forecast and causing its stock to surge. The strong performance was driven by improvements in its retail pharmacy operations and its Aetna insurance division, which has been working to recover from rising medical costs. CEO David Joyner highlighted investments in pharmacy technology and labor as key factors in the retail segment's success. While the company's health services unit saw a decline, the overall positive results signal that CVS's broader turnaround plan and cost-cutting measures are gaining traction.

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has launched investigations into four companies that operate a total of 34 pornography websites over potential non-compliance with new age verification rules. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, require platforms with adult content to use effective tools to prevent children from accessing it. The targeted companies reportedly have a combined total of over nine million monthly visitors. This enforcement action is part of a broader crackdown, as Ofcom has already opened probes into other platforms, including 4chan and a suicide forum, to ensure they are protecting minors from harmful content.</p>

The event takes place as the left faces setbacks in several countries, with conservative, anti-establishment populists gaining ground. Participants will debate winning strategies and how to combat the influence of a conservative movement increasingly inspired by the American right.</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep connection the Harbaugh family has to Canton, Ohio, a city known as the “Cradle of Coaches.” Before Jim and John Harbaugh became famous NFL coaches, their father, Jack Harbaugh, began his own coaching career there in 1961 after his playing days. The piece recounts several colorful and challenging anecdotes from Jack's early days coaching junior high football for Canton McKinley High. These formative experiences, from dealing with unruly players to being a scout-team quarterback, shaped the family's storied coaching legacy, making their return to Canton for the Hall of Fame game particularly meaningful.</p>
