          <p>According to a spokesperson, former President Joe Biden's last PSA blood test, a common screening method for prostate cancer, was conducted in 2014, which is consistent with current medical recommendations for men over 70. While the exact date of the test was not disclosed, it aligns with the guidelines suggesting that men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of PSA testing with their doctors, while those 70 and older should generally not receive PSA-based screening due to the risk of false positives. Biden's representatives mentioned the discovery of a small nodule in his prostate during a recent routine physical, leading to his diagnosis. Following the announcement of his diagnosis, former President Donald Trump questioned the timing of the announcement, which the article presents as a notable point of political discourse.</p>

For high-risk individuals, the FDA will still accept immunogenicity data, while healthy individuals will require randomized, placebo-controlled trials showing at least 30% effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID. The new guidance arrives as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls U.S. immunization policy.</p>

          <p>As talks between Iran and the United States progress, the potential for Washington's investment in Iran following the lifting of sanctions is emerging as a significant geopolitical issue. While Iran is open to enticing US investors, its willingness is highly conditional, particularly tied to complete sanctions relief. Iran is wary of economic espionage and investment frameworks which could involve strategic concessions. The article suggests that phased US investment under regional mediation could emerge as a possibility if a nuclear framework stabilizes, though any substantial economic opening would require approval from the US Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has prompted questions about screening and the disease's progression. Biden had not undergone prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024, and his last PSA test was in 2014, which aligns with guidelines recommending against routine screening for men over 70. Doctors say that aggressive prostate cancers can develop and spread rapidly, even with regular screenings. This situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual, and that the goal of treatment in such cases is to control the cancer, slow its progression, and preserve quality of life.</p>

          <p>Following former President Biden's diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer, experts are discussing screening guidelines and the potential for aggressive cancers to develop even with regular testing. Guidelines generally advise against screening after age 70, though some men may choose to continue with their doctor's advice. Experts say it's possible for aggressive cancers to arise between screenings or to go undetected by PSA tests. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends men ages 55 to 69 discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their physician, emphasizing the potential harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>
