          <p>President Donald Trump is set to launch a yearlong celebration for the 250th anniversary of American independence with an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. The kickoff will feature patriotic displays, musical performances, and fireworks, with organizers hoping the festivities will help unite a politically polarized nation. The choice of Iowa, a state Trump won in the last three elections, is described as symbolic of bringing the country together from its center. The event comes amidst deep partisan divides, particularly over a major legislative package being pushed by the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's 3,000th career strikeout, a Los Angeles Times columnist makes the case that he is the greatest pitcher in the history of the Dodgers franchise, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting it with Koufax's brilliant but shorter five-year peak. While acknowledging Koufax's superior postseason record, the article points to Kershaw's larger body of work, including more wins, more strikeouts, and a better career ERA. The piece concludes that Kershaw's sustained excellence and professionalism have defined a golden era for the team.</p>

New listing volumes surged to $14 billion, an eightfold increase from the previous year, positioning the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. This revival is driven by a confluence of factors, including regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and U.S. delisting fears prompting Chinese firms to seek capital in Hong Kong. The influx of mainland investors has also provided ample market liquidity, further fueling the frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that suspended the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president had exceeded his legal authority, stating that he cannot unilaterally "adopt an alternative immigration system" that supplants laws passed by Congress. The executive order, issued in January, had characterized the border situation as an "invasion." The judge's decision, which has been stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, was praised by the ACLU as critically important for people fleeing danger.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that postmenopausal women using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy may have a higher risk of breast cancer. The research found that for women under 55 who still have a uterus, this combination therapy increases risk, whereas using estrogen alone‚Äîtypically for women who have had a hysterectomy‚Äîactually reduces the risk. This finding refines the understanding of hormone replacement therapy, which has evolved since a controversial early 2000s study. Experts emphasize that the therapy remains highly effective for menopausal symptoms and advise personalized consultation with a doctor.</p>
