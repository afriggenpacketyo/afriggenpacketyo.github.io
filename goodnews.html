          <h2>Trump Urges Fed to Lower Rates Following Positive Jobs Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 09:23:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to decrease interest rates after the April jobs report exceeded expectations, citing the absence of inflation and the potential for further economic growth. In a Truth Social post, Trump emphasized the need for lower rates to benefit consumers and stimulate the economy, while also scaling back criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate, leading to a rise in stock futures. Trump's continued efforts to influence the Fed's decision-making process highlight the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his appeal in a U.K. court regarding the downgrading of his official security detail following his decision to step down as a working member of the royal family and relocate to the United States. Harry argued that private bodyguards are insufficient due to their inability to carry guns or access government security networks. He stated that the U.K. is his home and central to his children's heritage, but safety concerns prevent them from feeling at home there. The court upheld the previous ruling that allowed the British government to scale back his close protection detail.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has achieved its first Parliamentary by-election victory in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating Labour after a recount, and secured its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire. Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, but with significantly reduced vote shares as Reform came in a close second in all three races. The Conservatives lost the mayoralty in Cambridgeshire & Peterborough to Labour, and Reform UK is making significant gains in council seats across England, with a vote share of approximately 35%.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and centralize political power under the Communist Party. Spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating 100,000 public sector jobs. The government also plans to reduce provinces and municipalities from 63 to 34, streamlining local governance and replicating this two-tier system within the Party, military, and judiciary. These changes aim to address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign and prepare Vietnam for economic challenges, with the goal of achieving high-income status by 2045.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently higher than they have been in years, providing an opportunity for savers to earn a return that outpaces inflation. National average CD rates vary by term, with one-year CDs yielding around 2.01% APY, while top online banks offer rates as high as 4.50% APY for six-month CDs. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and opting for short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by purchasing CDs with varying terms, is one approach to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing economist forecasts despite concerns about the economic impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, indicating a stable labor market, with notable job gains in health care and transportation/warehousing sectors. However, government data revealed an increase in Americans filing for unemployment benefits, and the nation's gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter. Experts suggest that the April jobs report may not fully reflect the impact of trade war 2.0, government job cuts, and tight immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost a legal challenge concerning the level of security provided to him and his family while in the UK, after he and Meghan stepped back from frontline royal duties in January 2020 and moved overseas. The dispute arose after his security was downgraded, and he sought to overturn the decision, arguing that the current arrangements could expose his family to danger. The court upheld the government's position that he should not automatically be entitled to the same level of security as other senior royals, with security needs assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

This commitment signals faculty support for Harvard's rejection of unlawful demands and its defense of academic freedom.
