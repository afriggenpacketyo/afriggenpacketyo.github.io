          <h2>'Clear Protein' Emerges as a Popular New Trend in Nutritional Supplements</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 17:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new supplement trend, clear protein, is gaining significant traction among consumers seeking lighter, juice-like alternatives to traditional creamy protein shakes. Made from whey protein isolate, this form is often lower in fat, carbs, and lactose, making it suitable for those with digestive sensitivities while still delivering 20-25 grams of protein per serving. While searches for "clear protein" have surged, experts note that it is not inherently healthier than traditional whey concentrate and can be more expensive and contain artificial sweeteners. Dietitians advise that the choice between clear and traditional protein should depend on individual goals, preferences, and lifestyle needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sabrina Carpenter's latest album, "Man's Best Friend," delves into the theme that her newfound pop superstardom has not improved her romantic life, continuing the narrative from her previous hit album "Short n' Sweet." The album critiques a series of disappointing men through a blend of '70s-inspired pop, disco, and country sounds, produced with collaborators like Jack Antonoff. Despite some controversy over its cover art, the album is framed as a satirical commentary on the limited dating options available even for a successful woman. The review highlights standout tracks like "Goodbye" and "House Tour," praising Carpenter's sharp wit and versatile vocal performance, even if the album isn't consistently as strong as its predecessor.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has abruptly cancelled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich and instructed him to return to London, just as he was about to complete his medical in Germany. The decision was made after fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap sustained a serious hamstring injury during a match against Fulham, which could sideline him for up to eight weeks. The sudden reversal left Chelsea with only one fit senior striker, João Pedro, creating an unexpected squad crisis. The move has reportedly angered Jackson, and Bayern Munich's sporting director confirmed the recall, leaving the future of the deal uncertain as Chelsea scrambles to manage its depleted attacking options.</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Age-Based Guidelines for Children's Screen Time Amid Evolving Technology</h2>

          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus is forming among child development experts regarding safe screen time limits for children, based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is "screen-free until age three," as this period is crucial for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is suggested to encourage imagination and social interaction, while elementary schoolers should be limited to 30-45 minutes of supervised time. While acknowledging the difficulty of enforcement with adolescents, experts stress that content quality and parental engagement are more important than strict time limits, warning that excessive screen time can negatively impact language and motor skills.</p>

          <h2>Massive Hydrothermal Vent Field Discovered in Pacific Ocean Dwarfs 'Lost City'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:00:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deep-sea exploration vehicle has discovered a colossal hydrothermal vent field in the Pacific Ocean, named the Kunlun field, which is over a hundred times larger than the famous 'Lost City' vent field in the Atlantic. Located northeast of Papua New Guinea, this 'undersea metropolis' features deep craters and dolomite walls, releasing hydrogen-rich fluids at relatively low temperatures. Scientists are particularly excited by this discovery because its conditions may resemble those on early Earth, offering a prime location to study the origins of life. The field also supports a diverse ecosystem of deep-sea life, potentially reliant on hydrogen-driven chemosynthesis, and challenges previous assumptions about where such systems can form.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is experiencing a career revival since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, where he had limited playing time. In just two starts, he has become a key player for his new club, providing two assists in consecutive Premier League matches and earning man-of-the-match honors. Everton manager David Moyes praised Grealish's performance, suggesting the player "needs a bit of love and attention" to showcase his maverick creativity. Despite his excellent form, Grealish was once again left out of the latest England squad, raising questions about whether his resurgence at Everton could still earn him a spot in the upcoming World Cup plans.</p>

Gauff, who recently changed her coaching team to address persistent issues with her serve, appeared much more settled and confident, committing only four double faults and dominating the match from the baseline. This victory marks her fourth consecutive appearance in the second week of her home Grand Slam. She now faces a highly anticipated match-up against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka, in what will be a rematch of their 2019 encounter at the same tournament.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced on social media that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer, sharing a photo of his face bandaged after a procedure. He thanked his medical team for removing a Basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer often caused by long-term sun exposure. Ramsay, 58, used his diagnosis as a public service announcement, strongly urging his followers to use sunscreen, especially during the holiday weekend. Basal cell carcinoma typically appears on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck and is generally treatable, particularly when detected early, as appears to be the case with the famed chef.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since rumors of his death trended on social media, appearing on the White House south lawn before a family golf trip. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a "terrible tragedy" were to occur, raising concerns about the 79-year-old's health. Trump, appearing in his signature "Make America Great Again" hat, was photographed with his grandchildren before heading to his golf course in Virginia. The White House has recently addressed other health concerns, attributing bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified for three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigators traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response to the outbreak, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and increased inspection capacity for the health department to enhance public safety.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London conducted a large-scale trial in GP surgeries, finding that the AI tool significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The device analyzes subtle differences in heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI for instant analysis. Experts believe this innovation could be a "real game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive crucial treatment sooner and potentially saving lives, with plans for a wider rollout across the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Macon Blair's remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as the titular mutant hero in a version that is notably more polished and emotionally grounded than the Troma original. The film pits its hero, Winston Goose, a janitor transformed by toxic waste, against a villainous pharmaceutical CEO played by Kevin Bacon. While the remake retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of the original, its higher production values and sincere character moments create a different experience. The review suggests that while it's a diverting and gruesome homage, its mainstream appeal makes it less of a true tribute to Troma's signature brand of offensive, low-budget filmmaking.</p>
