          <p>Meta is transitioning to artificial intelligence for its FTC-mandated privacy compliance reviews, resulting in layoffs within its risk organization. The company’s chief privacy officer announced these job reductions, indicating a shift towards automating the assessment and documentation of product risks to ensure global regulatory adherence. This internal restructuring follows a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission, which prompted Meta to overhaul its privacy approach. The company emphasizes that its revamped system relies on basic automation to reduce human error and increase reliability, rather than advanced generative AI. This strategic move aligns with a wider industry trend where major companies are increasingly adopting AI technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce workforce size.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that she believes there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff for mortgage fraud. This assessment contradicts President Trump's public demands for the criminal prosecution of Schiff, a staunch critic and key figure in Trump's first impeachment. While Hayes, an experienced prosecutor, conveyed her doubts, a controversial senior DOJ official, Ed Martin, is reportedly advocating for the continuation of the investigation. Senator Schiff has consistently labeled the allegations as "transparently false" and a politically motivated attempt to silence his opposition, raising significant concerns about potential undue influence within the justice system.</p>

          <p>Apple has lost a landmark lawsuit in the UK, with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruling that the tech giant abused its dominant market position by imposing "excessive and unfair" App Store commission fees. This judgment could result in approximately 36 million UK iPhone and iPad users receiving substantial compensation, potentially totaling £1.5 billion, for purchases made over the last decade. Lawyers representing the academic who initiated the case asserted that Apple generated exorbitant profits by eliminating competition in app distribution and in-app purchases. Apple has announced its intention to appeal this decision, which adds to the mounting global regulatory scrutiny the company faces over its App Store policies and market power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 17:33:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings but subsequently lowered its 2025 guidance, attributing the revision to a supplier fire that disrupted production of its profitable large trucks and SUVs. The fire at an aluminum plant is estimated to cost Ford between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, though the company anticipates recovering a significant portion through increased manufacturing efforts next year, including adding 1,000 workers. Despite this setback, Ford's stock initially rose, reflecting confidence in its underlying business strategy. The company's CFO noted that without the supplier incident, Ford would have raised its 2025 outlook, indicating positive operational performance despite external challenges.

          <p>A Colorado woman, Elizabeth Ann Davis, 61, has been convicted of voter fraud for illegally casting mail ballots for her late ex-husband and son in the 2022 general election. Davis was found guilty of two counts of forgery and one count of impersonating an elector, offenses that carry a potential sentence of up to three years in prison. Prosecutors underscored that while voter fraud is generally uncommon, the nation's election processes include robust safeguards, such as mandatory ballot signatures, to detect such illicit activities. The District Attorney's office affirmed its commitment to prosecuting individuals who attempt to undermine election integrity, even through a single fraudulent vote.</p>

          <p>Gold prices recently experienced a significant 6% drop, marking the largest single-day decline in over a decade, which is prompting investors to reconsider purchasing the metal. Despite the current price of $4,131.47 per ounce remaining relatively high, this dip offers a more affordable entry point for those interested in gold investments, including from major retailers like Costco. The article suggests that buying during such temporary price declines is often a sound strategy, as gold prices historically rebound. Costco provides a flexible and vetted option for acquiring physical bullion, potentially offering easier resale and avoiding shipping costs, though consumers should note that all gold sales from the retailer are final.

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates are currently near a two-year low, averaging 8.11% for a 5-year loan, making them an attractive option for homeowners amidst economic uncertainties. This rate presents a significantly more affordable borrowing alternative compared to personal loans or credit cards, which carry much higher interest rates. The article advises that waiting for potential future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve may not be beneficial, as any reductions are expected to be minimal. By securing a low, fixed home equity loan rate now, homeowners can access needed funds and protect themselves from potential future rate increases, with the flexibility to refinance if rates substantially decline.
