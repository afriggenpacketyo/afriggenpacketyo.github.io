          <p>Japan and the United States are planning summit talks between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven (G7) leaders' meeting in Canada. Ahead of the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for another round of negotiations on the Trump tariffs. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced rates as the U.S. has refused to eliminate the duties entirely. The two countries aim to reach a deal as early as possible, focusing on boosting investment and creating jobs in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to combat rising rice prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with expectations to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons prior to previous releases. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the government aims to quickly deliver the rice to consumers at lower prices. This action is aimed at addressing public frustration over the doubling of rice prices compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk among those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC shows a significant decrease in deaths attributed to fentanyl and other drugs among people under 35. This positive trend is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, researchers caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, particularly for those struggling with severe addiction. The article offers a hopeful outlook.</p>
