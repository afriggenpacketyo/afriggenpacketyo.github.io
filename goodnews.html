          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 05:59:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government strategy to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The goal is to shift the NHS from a reactive healthcare system to one that proactively identifies and addresses potential health issues before symptoms manifest. While supporters tout the potential for personalized healthcare and reduced pressure on NHS services, concerns have been raised about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the vast amount of genetic data and provide appropriate counseling to patients. This program aims to revolutionize prevention through genomics and AI, providing faster diagnoses and early warnings for diseases.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to approve the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was passed by the House of Commons but faces potential opposition in the Lords, with critics expressing concerns about the potential for coercion of vulnerable individuals. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the need for scrutiny but not opposition, while some peers plan to introduce amendments to strengthen safeguards. The proposed legislation would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to request an assisted death, subject to multiple assessments and approvals. </p>

          <p>Prince William celebrated his 43rd birthday with a photo released by Kensington Palace, showing him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and three of her puppies. The picture, taken by the Princess of Wales, was shared on social media with a message signed with love from Catherine, their children, and "the puppies". The Royal Family's official account also posted a birthday message with a photo of the prince visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was given to the royal couple by Catherine's brother in 2020, and she recently gave birth to four puppies. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 04:47:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, long before China imposed export restrictions. In 2010, China's export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo after a territorial dispute motivated Japan to change its approach to supply chain security. Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, which helped reduce its dependence on Chinese rare earths from over 90% to below 60%. Japan's efforts serve as a template for Western nations seeking to diversify their critical mineral sources, although escaping China's dominance remains a significant challenge. </p>

          <p>A message in a bottle sent by a Scottish schoolgirl in 1994 was discovered in Norway 31 years later, resulting in a reply to the delighted sender. Alaina Beresford, from Portknockie in Moray, sent the message as part of a school project, and it washed up across the North Sea. Pia Brodtmann, a volunteer cleaning up a Norwegian island, found the bottle and sent a postcard to Alaina, who was stunned to receive it after so many years. The original handwritten letter, sent in an empty bottle of Moray Cup, remained in remarkably good condition. </p>

          <p>Recent criticism of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae raises questions about the nature of feminist critique in the digital age. The debates often occur on online platforms, which could provide a space for serious discussion about popular culture, but instead are dictated by sexist algorithms rewarding extreme views. The author argues that vitriolic chastisement is no substitute for meaningful critique and that modern critiques often ignore the complex history of feminist thought. By reverting to paternalistic tellings off, the author suggests, contemporary feminism risks packing women into smaller boxes. </p>

The company's decision to close its stores in France in 2022 was part of an adjustment in its retail strategy to better respond to French consumers' purchasing behavior. This expansion reflects a broader trend of Chinese brands enhancing their image and market presence in Europe. </p>
