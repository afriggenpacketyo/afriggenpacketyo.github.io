The mission, designated CRS-33, will deliver crew provisions, scientific gear for studies on bone loss and 3D bioprinting, and station hardware. A significant addition is an add-on thruster kit with Draco engines, designed to help maintain the ISS's altitude, diversifying the station's re-boost capabilities. This innovative propulsion system will contribute to the station's stability, marking a new chapter in its operational support.</p>

Built on an old utility trailer, the compact structure includes essential amenities like an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, and a portable toilet, all powered by solar panels. Kelly emphasized creative problem-solving for small spaces and advised aspiring builders to prioritize their needs, noting that even a few extra inches can make a significant difference.

This substantial increase comes after no single ticket matched all winning numbers in Saturday's drawing, which offered an estimated $700 million. The highly anticipated Monday drawing boasts an estimated cash value of $338.6 million. While the grand prize remains elusive, several players secured significant wins, including two tickets matching five white balls for $1 million each, and a South Dakota ticket that doubled its prize to $2 million by utilizing the Power Play option.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space industry has grown critically dependent on Elon Musk's SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion, for vital space access. Starting as a struggling startup in 2002, SpaceX's ascent was significantly bolstered by early NASA contracts for cargo and astronaut transport to the International Space Station. Today, its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are primary launch vehicles, and Starlink satellites provide essential internet access globally, including for U.S. allies in wartime. The company's innovations have dramatically lowered space access costs, fostering a new ecosystem of companies worldwide.</p>

          <p>Rhode Island has become the first U.S. state to legally require workplace accommodations for menopause, including provisions for temperature control, flexible breaks, and private spaces for symptom management. The law, effective June 24, validates menopause as a legitimate workplace issue requiring employer responsibility, moving beyond the traditional view of it as a personal failing. The article highlights the importance of involving affected communities in policy-making, criticizing a broader trend of decisions made without input from those who will live with the consequences, particularly in health policy under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Coyotes are increasingly adapting to urban life across the U.S., with notable success stories like a pair named Romeo and Juliet thriving in New York City's Central Park. Naturalists and photographers are dedicated to documenting these animals to educate the public, emphasizing that coyotes rarely pose a threat to humans and should be given space. This eastward expansion of the species is attributed to a decline in natural predators and the transformation of farmlands into suburbs. Officials have shifted from aggressive capture methods to promoting coexistence through public education and responsible wildlife management.</p>

          <p>Despite initial investor disappointment over trial data, Eli Lilly's oral obesity pill, orforglipron, is still considered a viable and strong competitor to Novo Nordisk's oral Wegovy. Analysts highlight several advantages for Eli Lilly's drug, including easier absorption without dietary restrictions and simpler, large-scale manufacturing capabilities, which are crucial given high demand. Although showing slightly less weight loss in trials compared to Novo Nordisk's offering, orforglipron's potential for lower pricing and broader global distribution could position it as a significant player in the rapidly expanding and lucrative weight loss drug market.
