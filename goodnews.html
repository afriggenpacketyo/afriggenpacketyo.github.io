          <h2>Trump Plans to Officially Recognize "Arabian Gulf" Instead of "Persian Gulf"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 22:23:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump intends to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his trip to Saudi Arabia. This decision aligns with the preferences of Arab nations but contrasts with Iran's historical ties to the name Persian Gulf. The name change has been an emotive issue, particularly for Iranians who identify with the region's long history as the Persian Empire. While Trump can change the name for official U.S. purposes, the move may be viewed as a symbolic gesture of support towards Gulf countries, with whom Trump has sought closer financial and political ties.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted student loans after a five-year pause, implementing an accelerated process to collect funds from wages, tax refunds, or Social Security benefits. Borrowers in default, defined as those who haven't made a payment in 270 days, will receive notifications regarding the Treasury Offset Program. Options for borrowers to resolve their default status include paying the loan in full, rehabilitating the loan through nine on-time payments, or consolidating the loan.

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio to stimulate economic growth amid trade worries. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, releasing 1000 billion yuan ($138.6 billion) into the market.

          <p>During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump engaged in light sparring over trade and the possibility of Canada joining the U.S. Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale," countering Trump's romanticized idea of acquiring the country. The meeting touched on trade negotiations and global issues, with both leaders acknowledging the importance of a strong partnership. Despite tensions over tariffs and borders, Trump insisted that the U.S. will remain friends with Canada, though he didn't completely abandon the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state.</p>

Trump praised Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his previous threats to turn it into the 51st state. Carney, however, made it clear that Canada is not for sale. Trump covered a wide range of topics during the meeting, including unrelated issues such as Barack Obama's library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen, as he tried to navigate the awkwardness created by his previous rhetoric.</p>

However, a plant in Shanxi province is upgrading with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from China‚Äôs low-grade ore. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing the use of high-silica bauxite in the Bayer process.
