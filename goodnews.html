          <p>Jannik Sinner secured his first Wimbledon final appearance by defeating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in a decisive straight-sets victory. The 23-year-old Italian will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, setting up a highly anticipated rematch of their recent five-set French Open final. The 38-year-old Djokovic, who was seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title, acknowledged that age and physical wear were significant factors in his defeat but confirmed he intends to return to the tournament. Alcaraz advanced to the final after a four-set win over American Taylor Fritz.</p>

          <p>The Sound and Fury Festival in Los Angeles showcases the evolution of hardcore music, a genre that has recently expanded beyond its traditional sounds. Bands like Knocked Loose, this year's headliner, are pushing boundaries by incorporating new influences, which has attracted a wider audience and sometimes polarized longtime fans. Bryan Garris, the vocalist for Knocked Loose, notes that this innovation has created more diverse and interesting musical experiences. The festival, founded in 2006, has become a premier event for modern hardcore, successfully blending rising acts with established names while maintaining its DIY ethos and community focus.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:19:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve policy in the future. This upward trend reflects growing institutional confidence and accelerated corporate buying, positioning the cryptocurrency for potential further gains despite the lack of major macroeconomic catalysts during the summer months.

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabins, such as business and first class, mirroring the tiered options available in its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that premium seating has been a key driver of profit, with revenue from these seats growing even as main cabin revenue has declined. While specific changes have not been announced, possibilities could include different tiers of business class with varying amenities, such as lounge access or more space. This strategy reflects a broader industry trend of enhancing high-end offerings to cater to diverse customer needs and maximize revenue.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Treasury Reports Unexpected $27 Billion Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Receipts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a surprising budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a surge in tariff-related revenue. Receipts from customs duties were up 301% compared to the same month last year, following the administration's implementation of broad new tariffs. This monthly surplus helped reduce the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion with three months remaining. Despite the positive month, the government's finances remain challenged by persistently high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled $84 billion in June alone.

          <p>Chemical company DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning PFOA contamination of the water supply in Hoosick Falls, New York. This brings the total settlement amount from all companies involved, including 3M and Saint-Gobain, to over $90 million. The lawsuit, filed in 2016, alleged that a local facility that used Teflon materials contaminated local drinking water with the harmful "forever chemical." The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, also includes $6 million to fund an existing medical monitoring program for residents exposed to the contaminated water.</p>

          <h2>Three Potential Ways for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:24:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's future solvency and potential benefit reductions, seniors may need to explore alternative income sources. This article outlines three potential options to supplement retirement funds. One method is a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive monthly payments from their home equity. Another option is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Finally, a personal loan can offer a financial buffer for emergencies, though it involves taking on new debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly tap into their home equity, several strategies can expedite the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with a fully online lender can streamline the process through digital automation and virtual appraisals. Homeowners might also consider a "low-doc" or "no-doc" HELOC, which minimizes paperwork but may come with higher rates. Working with one's existing mortgage lender can also be faster, as they already possess the necessary financial and property information. These methods can reduce the approval timeline from weeks to days. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely adopted goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research suggests it is a reasonable, if not precise, benchmark for physical activity. Health experts note that benefits from walking, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 steps, with many benefits plateauing around 7,500 steps. The key message from doctors is that any movement is better than none, and individuals should focus on gradually increasing their activity rather than fixating on a single number.</p>
