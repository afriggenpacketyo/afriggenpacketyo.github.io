          <p>Egyptian officials have announced the significant recovery of over 2,000-year-old artifacts from the Mediterranean Sea in Abu Qir Bay, near Alexandria. These historic treasures, which include a sphinx statue and Roman coins, are believed to be from an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, which thrived during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire. The damage observed on the statues, such as missing heads and feet, is attributed to a major natural disaster like an earthquake or tsunami, indicating that parts of Alexandria were submerged. This find not only confirms the site's past as a fully integrated residential city and port but also sheds light on the profound impact of geological events on ancient civilizations and the ongoing challenges faced by modern Alexandria due to rising sea levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has announced it will acquire a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a move driven by efforts to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and national security. This significant investment, valued at $8.9 billion, will be funded by converting previously awarded grants from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and the Secure Enclave program into Intel common stock. President Trump, who had earlier called for Intel's CEO to resign over alleged China ties, lauded the deal as a critical step in strengthening America's technological edge and bringing the chip business back home. While rare in modern times, similar government interventions, like the General Motors bailout in 2008, provide a precedent. This initiative seeks to revitalize Intel's position in the global chip market, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, where it has faced stiff competition.

          <p>Meta is set to unveil its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a display, codenamed Hypernova, at its annual Connect conference next month. These glasses, expected to cost around $800 and sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, will feature a small digital display in the right lens for simple information like text messages. Accompanying the glasses will be a wristband utilizing Meta's CTRL Labs technology, allowing users to control the device with hand gestures by interpreting electrical signals from arm movements. While Meta is setting low sales expectations due to the device's weight and thickness, this launch represents a significant step in the company's long-term push into augmented reality wearables, building on previous Ray-Ban Stories models. The company hopes to attract third-party developers to create experimental AI apps for the new devices.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly nearing the completion of significant new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, marking a strategic evolution in its broadcasting landscape. The proposed three-year deals would see NBC acquire exclusive rights to Sunday night games and wild-card playoff games for an estimated $200 million annually, while Netflix is set to secure the Home Run Derby for approximately $50 million per year. ESPN, meanwhile, would receive a new package valued at $550 million, encompassing MLB TV rights, in-market games for five local teams, and a new midweek national game package. These partnerships are designed to expand MLB's audience and revenue streams, adapting to the ongoing shift from traditional television to streaming services and positioning the league for future growth in a dynamic media environment.

          <p>Ether (ETH) achieved a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole, hinting at potential interest rate cuts. Powell suggested that with policy in restrictive territory, adjusting the stance might be warranted, catching many traders "off-sides" and leading to a "panicked repositioning" in the crypto market. The speech triggered approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour, pushing its price further up. This surge reflects a broader shift in the crypto market, where ether has recently outperformed bitcoin, driven by regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins, many of which are powered by the Ethereum blockchain. This development signals a potential new era for digital assets, with increased mainstream financial integration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Democrats have unveiled a new bill designed to establish legal thresholds for advanced chips, aiming to restrict their export to China without prior congressional approval. This legislative proposal defines specific performance benchmarks, such as total processing performance of 2,400, performance density of 1.6, memory speeds of 4,100 gigabytes per second, or interconnect speeds of 1,100 GB/s, that would necessitate a review. Representative Krishnamoorthi, a leading voice on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, emphasized that the bill's purpose is to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from leveraging America's cutting-edge chips to advance its surveillance, military modernization, and global influence. While addressing critical national security concerns, the measure faces an uphill battle to pass both the Republican-led House and Senate, highlighting the complexities of U.S.-China technological competition.</p>

Powell indicated that prevailing economic conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance," highlighting a significant slowdown in job growth and an increase in "downside risks to employment." This strong hint from the Fed, despite previous hesitations to cut rates amidst inflation concerns partly fueled by Trump administration tariffs, led traders to rapidly adjust expectations, now placing an 83% probability on a September rate cut. Analysts are forecasting a short-term relief rally for the stock market, as the central bank appears to be shifting its focus towards supporting the labor market and economic activity.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three common, often unexpected, factors that can reduce Social Security benefits for millions of American retirees. Firstly, working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, temporarily reducing payments, which many find surprising given current income limits. Secondly, Medicare Part B premiums, especially Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) for high earners, are automatically deducted from monthly benefits, significantly shrinking checks. Lastly, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, often catching retirees off guard. Understanding these potential pitfalls is crucial for effective retirement planning, with various options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities available to supplement income if benefits fall short.

          <p>Ron Turcotte, the revered Hall of Fame jockey celebrated for guiding Secretariat to an unforgettable Triple Crown victory in 1973, has passed away at the age of 84 due to natural causes. Turcotte's legendary partnership with Secretariat culminated in iconic wins, most notably the record-setting 31-length triumph in the Belmont Stakes, which ended a 25-year Triple Crown drought in horse racing. Throughout his nearly two-decade career, he secured multiple victories in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont Stakes. His career was tragically cut short in 1978 after a racing accident left him paraplegic. Inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1979, Turcotte remained an inspiration and an advocate for disabled jockeys, leaving an indelible mark on the sport.</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings, allowing lawsuits filed by bars and tavern operators seeking monetary compensation for COVID-19 restrictions to continue. These plaintiffs argue that executive orders from former Governor Roy Cooper, which closed bars but permitted restaurants and breweries to serve alcohol, resulted in unfair treatment and significant financial losses. The court's five Republican justices largely affirmed lower court decisions, rejecting the state's claim of immunity and clearing the way for plaintiffs to present evidence that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated. Conversely, the two Democratic justices dissented, asserting that the majority was overstepping its bounds by re-evaluating policy decisions made during a chaotic public health crisis. The Attorney General's Office is currently reviewing these pivotal decisions, which could have substantial implications for state government accountability.</p>

While some observers note the timing coincides with her role as a spokesperson for a GLP-1 brand, her candor is viewed by experts, such as Assistant Professor Caleb Luna, as a "breakthrough" that could challenge negative stereotypes surrounding drug use for weight management.
