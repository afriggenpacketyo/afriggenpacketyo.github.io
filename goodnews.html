          <p>A new art exhibition in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," features 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, repurposing them to challenge historical narratives. The collection includes a melted-down bronze statue of General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied monument of Lee and Stonewall Jackson, displayed alongside contemporary art pieces. Curators and activists involved state the goal is to confront the white supremacist ideology of the 'Lost Cause' that these statues represent. The exhibit opens amid a national debate over historical revisionism, highlighted by President Trump's recent order to reinstall similar monuments.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that resources will be made available to ensure Maccabi Tel Aviv fans can safely attend a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. This follows a controversial decision by the city's Safety Advisory Group to bar away fans due to safety concerns, citing previous violent incidents and rising antisemitism. Nandy called the initial ban "wrong" and confirmed that ministers are working to fund the necessary policing operation. The decision has sparked debate, with some praising the government's stance against discrimination and others warning against ignoring safety advice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a full-spectrum cannabis oil was more effective than both a placebo and opioids for treating chronic low back pain. One study showed the cannabis blend provided better pain relief and caused fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to opioids over a six-month period. While researchers consider the findings groundbreaking, the specific cannabis tincture, VER-01, is not yet available in the U.S. and would require further trials for FDA approval. The studies add significant evidence to the debate on using medical cannabis as an alternative for pain management.</p>

CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota indicate the presence of these critical minerals. The move aligns with a broader U.S. strategy to establish domestic supply chains for rare earths, which are essential for manufacturing in sectors like defense and electric vehicles, thereby reducing reliance on China.

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While costs have increased and disruptions persist, industry sales and production have held up better than expected, leading some firms to upgrade their sector outlook from negative to neutral. Automakers like GM and Ford have offset some tariff costs through deregulation and corporate gains. However, headwinds remain, including slowing consumer demand, stress in subprime auto lending, and the ongoing transition to electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an interview with CEO Brian Niccol, investment personality Jim Cramer expressed optimism for Starbucks, suggesting 2026 will be a strong year and recommending investors buy the stock. Cramer also commented on Boeing, noting that the company's official approval to increase 737 MAX production is a positive step toward stronger free cash flow after years of losses. He highlighted that Boeing's financial recovery is a key storyline for investors to watch. The analysis points to potential turnarounds for both major corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's upcoming five-year plan is expected to prioritize government investment in high-tech industries, such as advanced semiconductors, over measures to stimulate domestic consumption. As the country's export and infrastructure-driven growth models falter, analysts believe Beijing sees achieving technological sovereignty and resilience against U.S. pressure as its most critical challenge. While some steps have been taken to boost household income, significant resources will likely be directed toward industrial policy to compete with the West. This strategy reflects President Xi Jinping's focus on strengthening China's manufacturing and hard power amid geopolitical competition.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, experts are advising beneficiaries to carefully review their coverage options for 2026, especially as a federal government shutdown may affect access to information. While critical functions like the Medicare call center remain operational, potential staffing shortages could cause delays. Beneficiaries have until December 7 to switch between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans or change their Part D prescription drug coverage. Experts emphasize that plans and costs can change annually, making it crucial to compare options to ensure the best coverage and avoid unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill for the first time, a significant step for reproductive health access in the country. The manufacturer, ASKA Pharmaceutical, announced that its 'Norlevo' pill will be available without a prescription, though it must be taken in the presence of a pharmacist. This move brings Japan in line with over 90 other countries where the 'morning-after' pill is already accessible without prescription. The decision follows years of debate and campaigning by rights groups who argued that prescription requirements created barriers for women.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, stated that the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is "likely to end sometime this week." Speaking amid the third week of the funding lapse, Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats may soon vote to reopen the government, after which policy negotiations could resume. He warned, however, that if an agreement is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to cooperate. The shutdown stems from a partisan dispute over federal funding priorities, particularly Democrats' demands for additional healthcare spending.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally depreciate faster than their gasoline-powered counterparts, losing about 13% more value over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this include historically heavy government and manufacturer incentives, which lower resale values, and the rapid pace of technological advancements in battery range and features. As the used EV market grows and more affordable models become available, this trend could change. However, for now, the higher depreciation remains a significant consideration for value-oriented buyers, particularly in the used car market. (not investment advice)</p>
