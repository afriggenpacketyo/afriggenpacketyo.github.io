          <h2>Conservative Karol Nawrocki Wins Polish Presidential Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 00:49:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to final vote counts, conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland's presidential election in a tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. Nawrocki secured 50.89% of the vote, while Trzaskowski received 49.11%, revealing deep divisions within the country, a key member of NATO and the EU. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more nationalist direction under Nawrocki's leadership, who was endorsed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. With most day-to-day power residing with the prime minister, the president still wields influence over foreign policy and can veto legislation, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The election result is a boost for the Law and Justice party, which lost power in 2023, renewing their hopes for the 2027 parliamentary elections, as Nawrocki's victory will allow the party to continue to champion traditional, patriotic values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki is likely to become Poland's new president, with nearly all votes counted by the state electoral commission, though the official result is pending. Local media extrapolations indicate Nawrocki won 50.9% of the votes, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who secured 49.1%. Should Nawrocki's victory be confirmed, he is expected to use his presidential veto power to impede Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring closer ties with Germany and France, while Nawrocki advocates for a strong, sovereign Poland.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks have surged following the announcement of a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The deal involves a new company listed in Sydney acquiring all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating a merged entity with approximately $9 billion in value and A$13.1 billion in holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger aims to simplify the corporate structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The convergence of the Dragon Boat Festival and Children's Day in China has spurred a surge in domestic tourism bookings, particularly for campsites, amusement parks, and other family-friendly attractions. Short-haul domestic travel bookings have increased by 23% year-on-year, with parent-child orders comprising 35% of overall bookings, and family-friendly hotel searches rising by 45%. Travel platforms like Trip.com and Fliggy report significant growth in theme park ticket bookings and family hotel packages, driven by the appeal of summer escapes and activities such as water fun and picnics. Chinese officials view tourism as a key driver of support for the nation's service sector, as domestic holiday travel has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1m for the entire team. The MLSPA said the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes, but the league has ‚Äúfailed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.‚Äù</p>
