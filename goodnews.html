          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled a ¬£15 billion funding package for transport infrastructure across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country, marking a shift from stringent Treasury rules that favored London and the South-East. The investment will focus on tram, train, and bus projects, including extensions to tram networks in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, and the commencement of the West Yorkshire Mass Transit program. This five-year funding allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32 aims to address regional disparities and boost economic growth in areas facing electoral challenges. While some officials have praised the investment as a game changer, others have criticized the promises as lacking a serious plan.</p>

          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa announced a plan to address the company's struggles, including declining sales and increasing competition, by slashing 11,000 jobs and closing seven plants. Espinosa emphasized the short-term focus on fixing the company and expressed confidence in the restructuring plan's robustness. The automaker faces additional challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as the transition to electric vehicles. Recent talks of a merger with Honda fell through in February, leaving Nissan to navigate these challenges independently.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has processed approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act, leading to higher benefits and lump-sum retroactive payments for nearly 3 million people. The act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for individuals receiving income from public pensions not subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The agency credits automation for expediting the payments, and aims to update all affected beneficiary records by early November, exceeding initial estimates. Commissioner Frank Bisignano has pledged to complete the updates while the weather is warm.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have achieved a new distance record in quantum secure direct communication, tripling the previous distance to 300km. The researchers' new paper published in Science Bulletin, claims that the optical fibre network is theoretically scalable, showing the viability of this type of quantum network. While the transmission rate is still too low to handle images, this advancement marks a significant step toward long-distance, large-scale quantum communication networks. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have identified a sustained signal in the brain that lingers after positive or negative experiences, contributing to the generalization of emotions. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that profound experiences create a lasting neural activity, similar to a sustained note on a piano, which interacts with other experiences to shape emotional states. This finding could offer insights into emotional differences observed in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia. Some experts, however, argue that this sustained signal may not be specific to emotion and could be involved in other cognitive processes.</p>
