        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of over 130 retired judges has filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing that her arrest undermines judicial immunity precedents. Dugan was arrested on federal allegations of obstructing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to that given to members of the legislative and executive branches. They believe prosecuting Dugan would create a chilling effect on judges, stifling independent decision-making and threatening public trust in the judicial system. The judicial community feels that the prosecution threatens the independence of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>President Trump lauded Elon Musk for his contributions to the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a special government employee concluded. Trump stated that Musk's work has been unparalleled in modern history, praising his efforts to overhaul the federal government and cut costs. While DOGE's reported savings of $170 billion fell short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise, Trump indicated that Musk would remain involved as a friend and advisor. Musk defended DOGE's work and expressed confidence in achieving the $1 trillion goal over time, emphasizing the importance of reducing wasteful spending in government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial indicates that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, can double the survival time for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. This marks a significant breakthrough for a cancer type that has seen little treatment advancement in two decades, as more than half of those diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancers die within five years. The drug is administered before and after surgery to prime the body's defenses against the cancer. The trial demonstrated that patients receiving pembrolizumab were cancer-free for an average of five years, compared to 2.5 years with standard care, indicating the potential for longer, disease-free lives for many patients. The positive results offer hope for improved outcomes for those battling this challenging disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during remarks at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. Trump stated that the increased tariffs would further secure the steel industry, making it harder for foreign steel to compete in the U.S. market. He also addressed the controversial merger with Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to keeping U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of a decade, with no layoffs or outsourcing. U.S. Steel workers will receive a $5,000 bonus, with headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh as Nippon invests $14 billion in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. The report showed that consumer spending slowed despite rising incomes, potentially due to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs could push prices higher, though the timing and impact are uncertain after a recent court ruling. Walmart and Best Buy executives have indicated that they will increase prices to account for the tariffs, while the Federal Reserve is monitoring the impact on inflation and jobs.
