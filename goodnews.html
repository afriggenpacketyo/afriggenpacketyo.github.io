        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve approved a 0.25% interest rate cut, signaling that two additional reductions may occur before the end of the year due to growing concerns about the U.S. labor market. The decision, which places the benchmark rate in a 4.00%-4.25% range, was passed with an 11-to-1 vote, with newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a larger half-point cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as "risk management," acknowledging that job gains have slowed and downside risks to employment have increased, creating a challenging policy environment.

          <p>President Donald Trump commenced his second state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was formally welcomed by King Charles III and other senior royals at Windsor Castle. The visit included a ceremonial reception, a review of historical artifacts, and a formal state banquet attended by political figures and tech industry leaders. While the event was marked by traditional pomp and pageantry, it also drew thousands of protesters to central London, who demonstrated against Trump's politics. The visit aims to reinforce the U.S.-UK relationship ahead of America's 250th anniversary, with further diplomatic meetings scheduled with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is in the United Kingdom for an unprecedented second state visit, an honor not typically extended to second-term U.S. presidents. The trip includes a formal welcome by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, a state banquet, and a meeting with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers. The visit involves significant pageantry, including a royal salute and a flypast, alongside substantial security measures for the presidential entourage. While intended to strengthen diplomatic ties, the visit has also prompted large-scale protests in London, organized by a coalition of groups opposed to the president's political agenda.</p>

          <p>Nscale, a relatively new UK-based AI infrastructure startup, has rapidly emerged as a key player in the European market after securing major partnerships and investments. The company, which spun out of a crypto-mining infrastructure firm, announced collaborations with Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to expand AI data center capacity in the UK and Europe. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed a £500 million equity investment in Nscale, praising it as a potential "national champion" for AI. The deals align with Europe's push for "sovereign AI" and were announced during President Trump's state visit to the UK.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack is expected to miss approximately four weeks after suffering a dislocated elbow, a diagnosis that represents a better outcome than the season-ending injury initially feared. The injury occurred during a game against the Raiders, but Mack's toughness was praised by coach Jim Harbaugh. Despite the significant blow of losing a key defensive player, the team's defense has performed well early in the season. In Mack's absence, younger players like Tuli Tuipulotu and Caleb Murphy will be expected to take on larger roles on the defensive line.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Dermatology suggests that taking a form of Vitamin B3 called nicotinamide may significantly reduce the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The research, which involved nearly 34,000 veterans, found the greatest benefit among individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% lower risk of recurrence. Dermatologists are now more rigorously recommending the over-the-counter supplement as a secondary prevention method, noting its minimal side effects. The findings provide stronger evidence for a practice already common among many skin cancer surgeons.</p>

          <p>A dive team has positively identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a World War I-era fishing boat that sank during a storm in January 1929. All 21 crew members aboard were lost, and previous searches for the vessel had been unsuccessful. The identification was confirmed by matching distinctive features of the wreck, such as its double drum trawl winch and steam engine, with the historical records of the Seiner. The discovery provides closure nearly a century after the tragedy, and the salvage company is encouraging descendants of the crew to make contact.</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt at record levels, many Americans are struggling to keep up with payments, necessitating strategies beyond simple budgeting. This article outlines several effective methods for tackling debt, including the "snowball" method of paying off small debts first for psychological momentum and the "avalanche" method of targeting high-interest debts to save money. Other clever approaches include using 0% balance transfer offers, negotiating directly with creditors for lower rates, and seeking guidance from credit counseling agencies for a structured debt management plan. For overwhelming situations, debt settlement or bankruptcy remain viable, though more drastic, options.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill aimed at preventing the financial exploitation of the elderly and other vulnerable adults is gaining momentum in Congress. The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act would empower financial institutions, such as mutual fund companies, to delay transactions if they suspect a client is being scammed or abused. The proposal comes as reports show older Americans lose over $28 billion annually to financial fraud, often perpetrated by known individuals. A version of the bill was unanimously approved by the House Financial Services Committee, and it has been reintroduced in the Senate for consideration.</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to an issue with door trim. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a potential road hazard for other drivers. The issue is reportedly related to a vehicle assembly problem rather than a defective part. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim free of charge, and Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the flaw.</p>

          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino argued that despite public perception of high prices, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events. Speaking at a conference, he highlighted the immense demand for live events in the post-pandemic era, noting that touring has become the primary income source for most artists. He stated the average concert ticket costs $72, far less than premium seats at a professional basketball game. The live music industry is projected to grow significantly through 2030, fueled by strong demand from younger generations. (not investment advice)</p>
