          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, marking a significant return after decades spent working behind the scenes as a television writer and producer. The 66-year-old revealed he had to relearn his own hit songs and take guitar lessons, now choosing to play bass for a fresh challenge. Cassidy, who achieved fame in the 1970s with music and acting roles, candidly admitted he never truly enjoyed being a public figure but now embraces his role as a storyteller. His extensive "The Road to Us Tour" will feature a blend of classic tracks, new material, and personal narratives, promising a comprehensive look at his career starting in Nashville.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying against oligarchic control and bolstering Mamdani's progressive platform. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, champions policies like freezing rent prices, increasing housing availability, and raising taxes for the city's wealthiest 1%, resonating strongly with working-class and low-income communities. Sanders lauded Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a crucial "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail" against the influence of billionaire donors and tech oligarchs. The event also featured Mamdani's condemnation of CUNY's dismissal of professors supporting Palestinian solidarity, with both leaders criticizing the lack of embrace from mainstream and centrist Democrats for Mamdani's policies.</p>

          <p>USC's offense secured a dominant 59-20 victory over Clay Helton's Georgia Southern team, accumulating an impressive 755 yards, the most for the Trojans in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the charge, throwing four touchdowns and achieving a career-high 412 passing yards well before the fourth quarter. The article notes the Trojans' rushing attack also proved formidable, racking up 309 yards with notable contributions from Waymond Jordan and Eli Sanders. While USC's defense exhibited some breakdowns, the sheer offensive firepower negated any significant threat. This decisive win, coming against their former coach, provided a cathartic moment for the Trojan faithful, showcasing the team's strong start to the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, making it the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history after no tickets successfully matched all winning numbers in the recent drawing. For a single winner, the estimated cash value option stands at $826.4 million before taxes. This substantial increase follows 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, a streak that now ties the game's record. A fortunate winner has the choice of receiving a lump sum payment or an annuitized prize, which includes an immediate payment followed by 29 annual installments that progressively increase by 5% each year. The odds of claiming this monumental prize are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research team from the US and China has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes water droplets on the surface to boil and form vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles expand to a certain point, they suddenly collapse, releasing energy and creating a strong force that can propel small jumpers up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) into the air. This study, published in the journal Science, demonstrates that cavitation can serve as an efficient launching mechanism, with scientists able to control the flow of light to direct how and where these tiny robots launch or even swim in water.</p>

          <p>Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, defeating home favorite Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6(3) in a hard-fought final in New York. This victory marks Sabalenka's second consecutive US Open championship, making her the first woman to achieve this feat since Serena Williams's run from 2012 to 2014. The Belarusian world No. 1 expressed significant relief and joy, particularly after having experienced defeats in two other Grand Slam finals earlier in the year. She graciously praised Anisimova's strong performance while acknowledging the inherent difficulty of losing in a major final, thereby cementing her status as a consistently dominant force on the WTA Tour.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are increasingly adopting locked magnetic pouches from the company Yondr to effectively enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. This system mandates students to place their phones in a pouch that locks upon school entry and unlocks upon exit, aiming to significantly reduce distractions and cultivate improved classroom engagement. With over 2.5 million students in 35 states now utilizing these pouches, educators report observing a positive shift towards increased in-person interaction among students, despite some initial skepticism and attempts to bypass the system. The initiative's core purpose is to establish phone-free spaces, thereby promoting enhanced focus and fostering a crucial culture change within learning environments.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was generously gifted special baseball treats, including a gift bag filled with Marlins swag and an autographed bat from the player, after a home run ball he initially received was controversially taken by an adult woman. During a game between the Phillies and Miami Marlins, outfielder Harrison Bader hit a home run, and the ball landed near the boy, given to him by his father. However, a woman then confronted the father, claiming the ball was hers and ultimately taking it. Recognizing the unfortunate incident's impact on the young fan, Marlins staff quickly intervened with a gift bag, and Bader later personally met the boy to give him a signed bat, ensuring a memorable experience despite the initial disappointment.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively striving to shed its "one-man-band" image, aiming to significantly expand its electoral footprint and political influence beyond its highly prominent leader, Nigel Farage. The party is strategically showcasing new and aspiring candidates, such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, at its recent conference to highlight a broader base of talent and expertise. These hopefuls, many of whom have defected from the Conservative Party due to growing disillusionment, are undergoing rigorous vetting processes through assessment centers and specialized training. With strong national opinion poll leads, Reform UK has ambitious plans to field 5,000 vetted candidates in upcoming local and national elections, aspiring to gain more seats and potentially influence future government.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier with experience under mortar fire in Iraq, is passionately advocating for greater recognition and support for women veterans, especially those who performed dangerous front-line roles. She co-founded Sisters in Service, a community interest company that has grown to 160 members across the UK, providing vital support and connection for female military veterans now working in healthcare. Dr. Bennett believes many people still harbor "very outdated ideas" that only men deploy to the front line, leading to feelings of isolation and misunderstanding among women veterans. The group aims to offer a "cathartic" environment where women can share similar experiences, contrasting with traditional veterans' spaces where they often feel overlooked or presumed not to have served.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively employing decoy military equipment, such as plywood tanks and flat-pack howitzers, as a strategic tactic to deceive Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition and resources. These imitations, which range from small radars to full-scale vehicles, are meticulously designed to mimic real military positions, often complete with realistic details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates, sometimes even successfully fooling visiting officers. Volunteers play a crucial role in supplying these inexpensive decoys, such as the $500-$600 M777 models, which effectively draw fire from much costlier Russian Lancet kamikaze drones. The article notes that Russia also utilizes decoys, including imitation Shahed drones, to overload Ukrainian air defenses, highlighting a widespread "decoy war" being waged by both sides.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is poised to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in an upcoming ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Acutis, who tragically died of leukemia at the age of 15, earned the nickname "God's influencer" for his innovative use of websites to document miracles and disseminate Catholic teaching. His canonization, which was previously postponed due to the death of Pope Francis, follows the official attribution of two miracles to him. His body, preserved in wax, rests in Assisi, Italy, attracting over a million pilgrims. A shrine at Our Lady of Dolours Church in Chelsea, London, where he was baptized, is also experiencing increased visitors, as many young Catholics find connection with his modern approach to faith.</p>

          <p>The European Union's new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) is scheduled for a gradual introduction this autumn, designed to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. Starting October 12, this system will replace the current manual passport stamping, requiring first-time travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at automated kiosks or with border officers. Concerns have been repeatedly voiced regarding the potential for significant queues, particularly at busy transit points like the port of Dover and Eurostar terminals, during the initial registration process. While a mobile phone app has been developed to pre-process some information, its widespread use is not anticipated at the outset, leading to a phased implementation over six months across all 29 participating countries.</p>
