          <p>Faced with soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a mysterious human skull, dubbed "dragon man," found in the 1930s as belonging to the Denisovan species. Initially, it was difficult to identify because DNA extraction from a tooth failed, leading researchers to use dental calculus, a calcified dental plaque. Researchers used bleach on the dental plaque in order to eliminate any possible modern-day DNA. This discovery marks the first intact Denisovan specimen, revealing that this group coexisted with modern humans and was closely related to Neanderthals. </p>

          <p>A recent border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has put China's regional diplomacy to the test, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a crucial strategic region. Analysts suggest China will likely monitor the situation closely, avoiding direct mediation, but may work with ASEAN to prevent future confrontations. The clash, resulting in one death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, important for China's trade with Southeast Asia. This event adds to regional tensions, following a conflict between India and Pakistan, potentially impacting China's efforts to foster closer ties and counter US influence.</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving anomalous signals detected from below the ice in Antarctica. These strange radio waves emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, which should have absorbed them. Researchers believe these signals cannot be explained by the current understanding of particle physics, and follow-up observations have not been able to find the same signals.</p>

Players do exactly what the title suggests with the sounds of some relaxing music, bought seeds from the local shop, and watched them as they grew, something that continues even when you are offline.
