          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the nation's "broken" benefits system is a moral imperative, emphasizing that it should not be a "snare for those who can and want to work." His comments came a day after a Labour backbench rebellion forced the government to soften its plans to reform disability benefits. Despite the government's concessions, which include applying stricter criteria only to new claimants, some Labour MPs and the Unite union are pushing for further changes.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a Baltimore couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on the tenth anniversary of nationwide marriage equality. Although their initial legal battle was unsuccessful in court, their efforts helped pave the way for Maryland to legalize same-sex marriage by referendum in 2012, two years before the Supreme Court's landmark decision. They shared their personal story and voiced concerns over current efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ protections.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The invention was created for the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM) to assist with an annual fundraiser with Checkerspot Brewing Company. The machine is uniquely designed to be operated by BISM's low-vision employees and can handle materials that commercial braille printers cannot, showcasing a successful blend of innovation and accessibility.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs, shrugging off geopolitical fears following U.S. military action in Iran. The market's resilience was largely attributed to a significant drop in oil prices, which eased inflation concerns, and growing investor optimism for multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. While a key inflation metric, the core PCE price index, came in slightly hotter than expected, it did not derail the market's upward momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research on skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. Genetic analysis revealed that household members were primarily connected through the female line, with evidence indicating that husbands likely moved into their wives' households. Furthermore, females received five times more grave goods than males, challenging traditional assumptions about patriarchal structures in ancient societies and pointing to the central role of women in this community.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, openly defying a new law from Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government that effectively banned the event. The law criminalizes events that "promote" homosexuality to minors, but organizers and the city's mayor proceeded, framing it as a municipal event not requiring police approval. The massive turnout was seen as a significant rebuke of the government's crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights and a powerful demonstration for democratic freedoms in Hungary.</p>
