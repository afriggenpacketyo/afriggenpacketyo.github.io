          <p>B√§rbel Bas, who comes from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), signaling a potential shift for the ailing party. Elected with 95% of the vote, she belongs to the party's left wing and is seen as a counterweight to her more conservative co-chair, Lars Klingbeil. As the new labor minister, Bas faces the immense tasks of reforming unemployment benefits and the pension system while rejecting cuts to social benefits, a stance that has been celebrated within her party.</p>

          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay to "The Bay of New Jersey." The lawmaker, Michael Testa, stated the move is intended to better reflect the state's robust commercial and recreational fishing industries. This proposal appears to be inspired by former President Trump's executive order that changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America within the U.S.</p>

Experts note that Eutelsat's satellite constellation is much smaller than Starlink's, and catching up will require substantial further investment to increase its capacity and coverage in the Low Earth Orbit market.</p>
