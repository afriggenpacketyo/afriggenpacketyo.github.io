          <p>Thousands of people participated in a "Unite the Kingdom" march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in central London, while a counter-protest, the "March Against Fascism," also took place. The Metropolitan Police deployed around 1,000 officers to maintain order, creating a sterile area between the two groups. Protesters displayed various flags and banners with slogans ranging from anti-immigration to anti-transgender sentiments, and police reported being attacked with projectiles. The Met confirmed it would not use live facial recognition and urged Muslim Londoners not to alter their plans, taking a firm line on discriminatory behavior, with both protests expected to end by evening. The events highlight ongoing tensions and divisions within the UK. Optimism score is based on the fact that no deaths were reported and that there were efforts to de-escalate tensions. </p>

          <p>New Zealand's women's rugby team secured a spot in the World Cup semi-finals by defeating South Africa 46-17 after a slow start in Exeter. South Africa initially led, but New Zealand responded with tries from Theresa Setefano and Braxton Sorensen-McGee, leveling the game at half-time. In the second half, New Zealand dominated with five tries, including two from Renee Holmes and Sorensen-McGee, ultimately setting up a semi-final match against either Canada or Australia. South Africa managed a late try to conclude their memorable World Cup campaign, having reached the quarter-finals for the first time. The Black Ferns overcame early struggles, showing resilience for harder tests to come.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled that Meta violated porn star Esperanza Gómez's right to freedom of expression by deleting her Instagram account. The court found that Meta removed Gómez's account without clear justification and inconsistently applied its policies on nudity. Meta argued that Gómez violated its rules on nudity, but the court noted that similar accounts remained active. The ruling ordered Meta to revise its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions and more precisely define its rules on implicit sexual content. This decision underscores the balance between content moderation and freedom of expression on social media platforms.</p>

The United States won gold, equaling the championship record, with the Netherlands and Belgium completing the podium. Jessica Ennis-Hill noted the team's disappointment and potential for better performance, while Yeargin reflected on a near-collision with Femke Bol during the final leg.

          <p>Neil Hershman, the 30-year-old CEO of 16 Handles, transformed the frozen yogurt chain into a $21 million business after acquiring it in 2022. Hershman, a former Wall Street employee, initially bought a franchise in 2019 before purchasing the entire company, citing a lack of energy and innovation. He introduced limited-edition flavors and revamped the company's digital marketing strategy, leading to increased in-store traffic and sales. With 40 locations primarily on the East Coast, 16 Handles is experiencing a resurgence in customer demand, capitalizing on a renewed interest in frozen yogurt as a healthier dessert option.</p>

          <p>A presidential commission's report claims America is the "sickest country in the world," but this assertion is inaccurate, as decades of progress in medicine, public health, and environmental quality have significantly improved American health and longevity. While new health challenges like obesity and mental illness exist, Americans are far healthier than their ancestors. Over the 20th century, life expectancy increased by over 30 years, and deaths from infectious diseases, heart attacks, and cancer have declined. The article cautions against catastrophizing the present and urges building on past achievements rather than destroying them.</p>

          <p>Sachem Head Capital Management, holding a 2-4% stake in Performance Food Group (PFG), is pushing for a merger with US Foods and has nominated four candidates for PFG's board. Sachem Head believes a merger could yield $800 million to $1 billion in synergies, citing a similar proposed deal between Sysco and US Foods. While a merger between the first and second largest players was previously blocked, Sachem Head argues a PFG-US Foods merger, combining the second and third largest, may have a different outcome, especially under the current administration.
