          <p>A review of a power outage at Heathrow Airport revealed that the chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, was asleep and unreachable when the airport was closed. The closure, caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation, affected 270,000 journeys. The report found that Woldbye was not involved in the decision to suspend operations and only became aware of the incident hours later. The review recommended that Heathrow implement a second means of contact for key personnel during critical incidents, despite concluding that the airport responded efficiently and smoothly. The incident cost airlines millions and stranded many passengers.</p>

Trump praised Pirro's dedication to justice and the rule of law during the Oval Office ceremony. Pirro's appointment followed controversy surrounding Trump's previous pick, Ed Martin, whose past defense of January 6 rioters faced strong opposition. Pirro's first major action was investigating the deadly shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers as a hate crime and act of terrorism, emphasizing that antisemitism would not be tolerated in the nation's capital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and varying consumer acceptance of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. This expansion comes as automakers seek to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations, with PHEVs acting as a potential steppingstone to all-electric vehicles. Toyota is working to increase the electric-only range of its PHEVs, balancing product strength and competition in the market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently imprisoned for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple was sentenced in 2022 after being convicted of submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing their income from the IRS. Trump stated that the couple received "pretty harsh treatment" based on what he's hearing, while the couple's daughter has been seeking a pardon for her parents, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status. The Justice Department previously stated that their sentences reflect the magnitude of their criminal scheme and should serve as a warning.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO stands out because existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. Circle plans to sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares, a rare occurrence in tech IPOs. This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO, where 57% of shares were sold by existing stakeholders, though Circle's figure is even higher at 60%. One reason for the high insider sales is the prolonged period of meager returns for venture capital firms after the market peaked in 2021, leading to a need for liquidity among Silicon Valley's tech investors.

Additionally, a new flight credit policy will take effect, expiring flight credits issued May 28 or later within six months to a year, depending on the fare type.

Canada's defence minister echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need to boost defence capacity amid growing global threats.

          <p>President Trump's foreign policy prioritizes economic agreements with allies while showing less interest in diplomacy with rivals, particularly in resolving conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas fighting. He focuses on business deals and investments with wealthy Middle Eastern states, emphasizing commerce over conflict resolution. Analysts note that Trump's approach is more successful with allies who share similar interests but struggles with genuine conflicts of interest. His administration's reliance on dealmaking and skepticism of U.S. overreach may keep the U.S. out of major entanglements but could also lead to missed opportunities for influential roles in global hotspots.</p>

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger is retiring after leading the department through a challenging period following the January 6 attack. Manger helped rebuild the department, enhanced recruitment, and strengthened intelligence operations and communications. He criticized the pardons issued by President Trump to Capitol rioters, calling it one of his worst days in the job. Manger also highlighted the alarming levels of threats against members of Congress, necessitating increased funding and resources for the department.</p>
