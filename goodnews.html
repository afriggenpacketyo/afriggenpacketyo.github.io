          <h2>Survey Reveals Leading Candidates to Succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 19:45:45 EDT</div>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists and fund managers indicates a tight race for the next Federal Reserve chair, with Scott Bessent, Kevin Warsh, and Kevin Hassett emerging as the top contenders. The survey also reflects concerns about the Fed's independence amid political pressure, although most respondents don't expect current Chair Jerome Powell to be fired before his term ends. Respondents upgraded Powell's performance grade from last year but remain cautious about the economic outlook, citing tariff uncertainty and a slowing labor market as key risks. The consensus forecast suggests interest rate cuts are likely later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a projected shortage of primary care physicians, a growing number of U.S. medical schools are offering accelerated three-year MD programs. These fast-track options, like the one at UMass Chan Medical School, aim to produce doctors more quickly and at a lower cost to students, saving them a year of tuition. Proponents argue that graduates show no difference in competence and that many are drawn to practice in underserved communities. Critics question if three years is sufficient training, but program leaders emphasize that medical education is a process of lifelong learning.</p>

          <h2>Senators Introduce Bipartisan Resolution to Protect U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a resolution to support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) amid reports that the Health Secretary may disband it. The USPSTF is an independent panel of medical experts whose evidence-based recommendations guide free preventive care coverage, such as cancer screenings and heart disease prevention, under the Affordable Care Act. The resolution emphasizes the task force's crucial role in American healthcare and calls for its work to continue without political interruption. Proponents worry that disrupting the panel could lead to recommendations not based on science, harming public health.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, the Los Angeles Zoo is now home to Tasmanian devils, welcoming two males named Danny Zuko and Crush. The animals, born at a conservation organization in Australia, are now on display in the Animals of Australia exhibit. Tasmanian devils are the world's largest carnivorous marsupials and are known for their powerful bite and noisy feeding habits. The species is classified as endangered, primarily due to a contagious and fatal cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease, making their presence at the zoo significant for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>As design software company Figma prepares for its highly anticipated initial public offering, CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised caution for potential investors. While praising the company's strong fundamentals, impressive client list, and profitability, he warned that the IPO is priced at an expensive level. If the stock price surges immediately after trading begins, it could become overvalued. Concerns also linger about the broader enterprise software market's recent weakness and the potential impact of long-term AI spending on Figma's profitability, as noted by the company's CEO in the IPO filing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to long-held political wisdom, recent polling indicates that tax cuts are becoming increasingly unpopular with the American public. A Wall Street Journal poll shows that a majority of Americans oppose the latest Republican tax cut law, a sentiment echoed in other surveys. Analysts suggest several factors for this shift, including rising income inequality and a perception that such cuts primarily benefit the wealthy. Furthermore, the decades-old argument that tax cuts pay for themselves through economic growth has been repeatedly disproven, leading to voter concerns over the national debt and deficit.
