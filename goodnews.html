          <p>The White House has released the framework for a new trade agreement with Indonesia, confirming a 19% tariff rate on Indonesian imports into the U.S. In return, Indonesia has agreed to eliminate its tariffs on 99% of American goods, effectively creating an open market for U.S. industrial, tech, and agricultural products. The deal also includes forthcoming commercial agreements valued in the billions, such as a $3.2 billion aircraft purchase and $15 billion in energy product acquisitions. This agreement is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy of negotiating bilateral trade deals to reshape global trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos held a private meeting at the White House last week, lasting for over an hour. While the specific topics of discussion were not disclosed, the meeting signals a potential shift in the relationship between the two powerful figures, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. In his second term, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve relations, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. This meeting occurs amid a notable falling-out between Trump and Musk, creating an opening for other tech leaders to engage with the administration.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Federal Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 17:37:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales, a move that could significantly alter the housing market. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in gains, a figure unchanged since 1997. Proponents, including the National Association of Realtors, argue that the current tax structure creates a "stay-put penalty," discouraging older homeowners from selling and thus constraining housing inventory. Critics, however, contend that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further inflate home values. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Navin Khanna of New Jersey has pleaded guilty to leading a massive criminal enterprise that trafficked stolen catalytic converters, generating over $600 million in illicit revenue. Khanna admitted to operating a New Jersey-based auto parts company that purchased stolen converters from across the country. He then resold them to a metal refinery, which extracted valuable precious metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium from the devices. The nationwide scheme was uncovered following a traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Khanna now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role in the operation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn public attention for his unusual choice of hiking attire: dark blue jeans. The 71-year-old was seen hiking Camelback Mountain near Phoenix, Arizona, in temperatures exceeding 90°F, a decision that baffled fellow hikers and social media users. This is not the first time Kennedy's preference for exercising in denim has been noted, as he has also been filmed working out in jeans. The choice runs contrary to CDC recommendations for dealing with extreme heat, which advise wearing loose, lightweight clothing, especially in a city known for its record-breaking temperatures.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation signed by President Trump has created a new student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven plan will calculate payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with monthly bills ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings, and a minimum payment of $10. As the law also phases out several existing repayment options, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years and includes some benefits, such as a subsidy for those not making progress on their principal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector experienced a massive influx of capital in the first half of the year, with U.S. startups raising $104.3 billion, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Industry giants like OpenAI and Anthropic led this fundraising bonanza, attracting huge investments at soaring valuations. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period. This disparity shows that while venture capital continues to pour into AI, lucrative returns for early investors are not yet materializing at the same frenetic pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate for goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. In return, the Philippines will reportedly lift all tariffs on U.S. goods, creating an "open market." Similarly, Indonesia has agreed to eliminate tariffs on 99% of its trade with the U.S., opening its market to American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. These deals were announced following meetings at the White House and are part of the administration's ongoing effort to renegotiate global trade relationships ahead of an August 1 deadline.</p>
