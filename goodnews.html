          <p>A Harvard-trained educator argues that kids who learn how to use AI can become smarter adults if they avoid the mistake of simply copying and pasting AI-generated answers. Instead, students should be taught to use AI as a coach by asking follow-up questions to understand how chatbots arrive at their conclusions.
