          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed taking online orders after suspending purchases through its website in April due to a significant cyber attack. Shoppers can now buy a selection of fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales. The retailer plans to expand the available products to include more fashion, beauty, and homeware items in the coming days, with click and collect and delivery services to Northern Ireland expected to resume in the coming weeks. The resumption of online shopping is a crucial step for M&S, which has been working to restore its services since the cyber attack disrupted operations and affected deliveries.</p>

          <p>Amid rising concerns over sabotage and espionage, German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has called for increased use of artificial intelligence in national security.

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated rice prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The release will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness, and Koizumi has expressed interest in increasing rice imports to ensure a stable domestic supply. The government aims to distribute the rice to smaller supermarket chains and specialty shops to lower prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report acknowledges that Japan's efforts remain insufficient, noting its ranking of 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index. The government aims to step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making roles. The government adopted its latest basic policy on gender equality and women's empowerment, focusing on local economies and small businesses, amid a trend of female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam rose by 18.8%, while exports to Thailand and Indonesia grew by 20.9% and 16.8%, respectively. This expansion is partly attributed to Chinese manufacturers shipping more goods to factories in Southeast Asia to offset losses from high US tariffs. These factories then produce finished goods for sale locally or in Western countries, including the U.S.</p>
