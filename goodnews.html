          <p>President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against making cuts to Medicaid as they debated a major tax bill. Speaking at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Trump's warning underscored the challenges in passing the tax bill, which was being held up by some Republicans seeking reductions in the Medicaid program, a health-care coverage initiative primarily for low-income individuals jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program cover nearly 80 million Americans. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he plans to significantly decrease his political donations in the future, marking a shift from his substantial support for President Donald Trump's reelection efforts. Musk, who spent over $250 million aiding Trump's campaign, indicated he believes he has done enough in terms of political spending. He did however leave the door open to future involvement if he sees a compelling reason. His previous political activities, including contributions to Republican campaigns and a super PAC, have drawn criticism and impacted public perception of him and his companies.</p>

          <p>The gold-silver ratio, which compares the price of gold to silver, serves as a tool for precious metal investors to gauge relative value. A high ratio suggests silver may be undervalued, while a lower ratio indicates the opposite. Investors use this metric to inform decisions on whether to favor gold or silver investments. Currently, the gold-silver ratio is high, hovering around 100 to one, meaning it takes 100 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold. While silver is more affordable, gold has historically been a stronger portfolio diversifier. (not investment advice)</p>
