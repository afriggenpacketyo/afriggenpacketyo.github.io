          <p>At 45 years old, pitcher Rich Hill is set to make his debut for the Kansas City Royals, which will be his 14th different team in Major League Baseball. This move will tie the record for the most teams played for by a single player. His long career, spanning 20 seasons, will see him become the oldest pitcher to start an MLB game since 2012. His first start for the Royals will fittingly be against the Chicago Cubs, the team with which he made his major league debut in 2005.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, is traveling to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent Israeli proposal for a 60-day truce. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli troops during any potential ceasefire. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a breakthrough that could lead to the release of hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>The United States and Indonesia have agreed to a framework for a new trade deal that would see Indonesia eliminate most tariffs on American imports. In return, U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods would be set at 19%, a rate lower than what was initially proposed under President Trump's broader tariff plan. The framework also includes forthcoming commercial deals, such as a $3.2 billion aircraft purchase and $15 billion in energy product sales. Both nations will now work to finalize the details of the agreement, which aims to provide U.S. producers with greater access to the Indonesian market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn attention for his choice of attire during a strenuous hike in Arizona. The 71-year-old was photographed hiking Camelback Mountain in dark blue jeans despite temperatures exceeding 90°F. This sartorial choice confused fellow hikers and social media users, who noted the risk of wearing heavy denim in such heat. This is not the first time Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, has been seen exercising in jeans, a habit that contrasts with public health advice for dressing in hot weather, including recommendations from his own department.</p>

          <p>A recently passed bill signed by President Trump has established a new income-driven repayment option for federal student loan borrowers, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Set to be available by July 2026, RAP will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings, with a $10 minimum. The plan offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As other existing repayment plans are phased out, RAP will become one of only two options available to new borrowers, alongside a standard fixed-payment plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of the year, U.S. artificial intelligence startups raised a staggering $104.3 billion in venture funding, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Massive rounds for companies like OpenAI and Scale AI dominate the landscape. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period. This indicates that while investors are pouring unprecedented amounts of capital into AI, lucrative returns through public offerings or large-scale buyouts remain relatively infrequent, with smaller "bolt-on" acquisitions being more common.
