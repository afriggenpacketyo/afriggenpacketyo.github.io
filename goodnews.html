          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will not be altered, despite ongoing trade discussions between the two nations. Lutnick clarified that President Trump's earlier statement about a 55% duty on China includes both the standing 30% blanket tariffs and the 25% tariffs on specific products. These remarks followed high-level trade negotiations in London, where a deal was reportedly "done" but remains subject to final approval by both presidents. The current agreement maintains China's tariffs on the U.S. at 10%, a level set after a temporary reduction in retaliatory duties agreed upon last month. (not investment advice)</p>

Players must be out for at least 10 consecutive weeks to qualify for this protection, which provides a "Special Entry Ranking" for use in three tournaments upon their return.

The actual COLA is calculated using third-quarter inflation data, so the estimate is subject to change. Consumer prices rose less than expected in May, but Trump's tariff policies could potentially increase inflation and impact the COLA. (not investment advice)</p>
