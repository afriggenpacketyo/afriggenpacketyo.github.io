          <p>Louise Perry, in a guest essay for the New York Times, defends Elon Musk as a rare visionary who bends reality to achieve his goals, despite his volatility and recklessness.

She highlights the success of SpaceX and its potential to benefit from government funding, positioning Musk as a businessman and visionary. The article offers a nuanced perspective on Musk's controversial persona and his long-term ambitions, but it is not investment advice. </p>

Hill claimed on social media that Bauer "handed back an insurance sum to me that was meant for him in order for me to drop my countersuit," violating the agreement.
