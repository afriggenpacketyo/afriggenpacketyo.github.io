          <p>Phoenix police officers rescued an infant who had been left alone for several days in an apartment after the child's mother passed away. Responding to a neighbor's welfare check request, officers found the woman deceased and the baby on a bed, visibly emaciated. Bodycam footage showed an officer carefully moving the baby, who was then transported to a hospital for lifesaving care. The infant is now expected to make a full recovery, while the cause of the mother's death is under investigation.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs, capping a week that began with significant geopolitical uncertainty following U.S. military action in Iran. Markets initially reacted to fears of a wider conflict but rallied after tensions appeared to de-escalate, causing a sharp drop in oil prices. This pullback in energy costs eased concerns about inflation and corporate profit margins, allowing investor focus to shift back to economic data and potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The week's performance was also influenced by new inflation data from the PCE price index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a well-preserved 9,000-year-old city in modern-day Turkey, suggests it may have been a matrilineal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring tended to remain in their birth homes. The findings, which also show females received more grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations to her leg and foot in what officials believe was likely a bite from a juvenile shark. The incident occurred while she was swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island. The woman did not see what bit her, but experts who analyzed photos of the non-life-threatening injuries concluded they were consistent with a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the event, swimming was temporarily suspended, and patrols for marine life will continue throughout the summer.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the 30th annual Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and risking heavy fines. The event was seen as a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government, which recently passed a law outlawing gatherings that "promote" homosexuality to minors. To circumvent the ban, Budapest's mayor declared the march a municipal event. The massive turnout, which included supporters from across Europe, was not just a defense of LGBTQ+ rights but also a protest against what many see as a broader erosion of democracy in Hungary.</p>

          <p>Lockheed Martin, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, has successfully completed a complex flight test of its Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR). During the test, designated FTO-26a, the LRDR system detected, tracked, and discriminated a live, air-launched ballistic missile target that was equipped with countermeasures. The test, conducted over the north Pacific Ocean, successfully demonstrated the advanced radar's ability to distinguish a genuine threat from decoys and other clutter. This marks a significant milestone for the missile defense system's capabilities.</p>
