          <p>Tottenham Hotspur, under new manager Thomas Frank, showed promising signs despite a late collapse against Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup, ultimately losing in a penalty shootout. The team led 2-0 until the final minutes, with both goals coming from set-pieces, a hallmark of Frank's tactical approach. While the inability to secure the win highlights areas for improvement, the performance demonstrated a new, more pragmatic and organized style compared to the previous era. The focus on efficiency and defensive structure suggests a clear strategic shift for the club.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Brinker International, Kevin Hochman, has credited a significant boost in marketing for the recent success of the Chili's restaurant chain. The company increased its marketing budget from $32 million to $137 million, utilizing social media influencers and standardizing value meals to drive growth. This strategy helped the chain achieve a 23.7% increase in same-store sales, allowing the company to combat inflationary pressures and improve profit margins. The company subsequently raised its full-year forecast, leading to a modest pop in its stock price.</p>

          <p>Stargazers across the U.S. East Coast were treated to an unusual spectacle of spiraling lights in the night sky, coinciding with the annual Perseid meteor shower. The phenomenon was reportedly visible in numerous states and was likely caused by rocket launches that occurred the same evening. An astrophysicist from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics explained that the spirals were probably the result of an upper rocket stage tumbling and venting fuel, which then reflected sunlight. The launches included an Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana and a Vulcan Centaur from Florida.</p>

The group includes prominent leaders such as Abigael González Valencia of the "Los Cuinis" organization, an ally of the CJNG cartel. This move comes as the U.S. increases pressure on Mexico to combat drug trafficking and is the second major transfer of cartel members this year. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the collaboration, stating the extradited individuals will face severe consequences for their crimes against the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to new Sportico rankings. This represents a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was ranked last with a valuation of $930 million. The franchise's immense growth is largely attributed to its relocation to Los Angeles and the construction of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The valuation reflects the team's on-field success and owner Stan Kroenke's vision for the Hollywood Park district.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of Comedy Central's "South Park" is experiencing its best ratings in years, a surge attributed to its sharp satirical takes on President Trump and his administration. The second episode, which featured spoofs of the president, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, drew 6.2 million viewers in its first three days. This success comes as parent company Paramount navigates a tense relationship with the White House, having recently settled a lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview and canceled Stephen Colbert's show, which is slated to end in 2026.</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC is reportedly close to signing 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of approximately £26 million. The center-half has become a key target for the Premier League club as it looks to strengthen its defensive lineup for the upcoming season. In addition to the Leoni deal, Liverpool remains in discussions with Crystal Palace to acquire England international Marc Guehi. These potential signings would significantly add to Liverpool's summer spending, which has already been substantial as they aim to build a competitive squad under manager Arne Slot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, in contrast to a decline in several large-cap tech stocks. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on loans to finance operations and expansion. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 100% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's next policy meeting. (not investment advice)</p>
