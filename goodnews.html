        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing rising grocery costs, consumers are increasingly turning to generic or store brands, often perceived as inferior, but food experts say that generic brands can be just as good as name brands. Experts note that in many cases, generic products are made by the same manufacturers as name-brand counterparts, with minimal nutritional differences. The shift toward generic brands was also influenced by product shortages during the pandemic, prompting consumers to try alternative options. While some suggest splurging on ingredients that significantly impact flavor, many generic pantry staples are praised for their comparable quality.</p>

          <p>Millions are expected to participate in 'No Kings' protests across the U.S. coinciding with President Trump's military parade and birthday, fueled by opposition to his policies and actions. The protests, organized by groups like Indivisible, aim to demonstrate widespread resistance to Trump's administration, focusing on issues like defying courts, mass deportations, and attacks on civil rights. The protests gained momentum after Trump deployed troops to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement. Organizers emphasize safety and non-violent tactics, expanding pre-protest training due to heightened security concerns.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully extracted rubidium, a critical metal used in electronics and aerospace, directly from salt lake brine on a commercial scale. This breakthrough by the Qinghai Institute of Salt Lakes (ISL) could significantly reduce China's reliance on rubidium imports, primarily from Canada. The new method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, providing a domestic source for this strategically important material. Rubidium is used in various high-tech applications, including perovskite solar cells and atomic clocks.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Canada for the G7 summit provides an opportunity to improve relations between the two countries, which have been strained by allegations of Indian government involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen. Despite these tensions, both countries share strong trade and people-to-people ties, with significant Canadian investments in India. Analysts suggest that Modi's visit could lead to a renewed focus on economic and geopolitical cooperation, although unresolved issues surrounding the Nijjar assassination and concerns about Sikh extremism remain.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a ¬£116 million deal to acquire German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen, which includes a guaranteed ¬£100 million and ¬£16 million in add-ons. The move would be a club record for Liverpool, surpassing the previous record signing of Darwin Nunez. Manchester City had also expressed interest in Wirtz, but cooled their pursuit due to the high costs involved. Wirtz reportedly favored a move to Anfield, leading to Liverpool negotiating a deal below Leverkusen's initial valuation.</p>

The newspaper's editor, Claudio Cerasa, believes AI should be managed like the wind and integrated rather than used to replace human intelligence. While acknowledging the technology's flaws, Cerasa emphasizes its potential for research, summarizing documents, and even writing, but stresses the importance of human oversight. Il Foglio plans to continue using AI for a weekly section and occasional articles, labeling them clearly.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong can play a crucial role in advancing the internationalization of the Chinese currency by expanding its offshore liquidity while maintaining safeguards, according to HSBC's co-CEO David Liao. As a financial hub connecting East and West, Hong Kong is often the top choice for businesses choosing financing channels and locations. Hong Kong could further scale up yuan-denominated trade finance, as the yuan is now the third most used currency for global trade finance, after the US dollar and the euro.</p>
