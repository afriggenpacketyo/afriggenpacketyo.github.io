          <p>Model Christie Brinkley, who has been married four times, recently shared her perspective on the longevity of modern marriages. During a podcast appearance, she suggested the idea of marriage contracts that could be renewed every five years, allowing couples to reassess their relationship without complex legal battles. Brinkley reflected on her own experiences, admitting she has been a "fool for love" and that some of her past relationships made her feel unloved. She also discussed how writing her memoir required her to revisit difficult periods, such as divorces, to make the book relatable for readers who have faced similar challenges.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Haley Amaya, a 27-year-old Los Angeles-born model of Honduran descent who is dedicated to preserving her cultural roots through dance. Growing up in Koreatown, she used art as an escape and a way to build her identity, eventually founding the "Cinco Estrellas" ballet to offer free Honduran folkloric dance classes to younger generations. Despite her success in the competitive modeling industry, Amaya considers herself a cultural ambassador, using her platform to empower her community and speak out on issues like immigration raids. Her story highlights the power of art to connect individuals to their heritage and provide a positive outlet for youth.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, is offering new advice for today's retirees. In his latest book, he argues that his original, highly conservative rule can be updated, suggesting retirees can safely withdraw more than initially calculated. Bengen now recommends a withdrawal rate closer to 5.25% to 5.5% for current retirees, citing the benefits of a more diversified portfolio that includes small-cap and international stocks. He emphasizes that his research aims to help retirees enjoy their accumulated wealth without the pervasive fear of outliving their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition is celebrating the work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who became one of Europe's most famous artists by perfecting the art of the flower still life. Though less known today than her contemporaries, Ruysch achieved immense fame in her lifetime for her detailed, vibrant, and scientifically informed paintings of bouquets. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, she had unique access to exotic specimens, which she combined in compositions that elevated nature. The article explores her life, the context of the Dutch Golden Age, and how her art masterfully blended aesthetic beauty with scientific observation and moral undertones.</p>

          <p>In a sign of de-escalating tensions, North Korea has started removing propaganda loudspeakers along its border with South Korea, according to Seoul's military. The move follows South Korea's own dismantling of speakers and halting of broadcasts shortly after the election of President Lee Jae Myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. For years, both sides have used the speakers to broadcast messages, K-pop music, and unsettling noises across the demilitarized zone, a practice that had recently resumed. This reciprocal action suggests a potential thaw in relations after a period of heightened animosity under the previous South Korean administration.</p>

          <h2>American Shopping Malls Are Evolving with Non-Traditional Tenants</h2>

          <p>The American shopping mall is undergoing a transformation to survive in the modern retail landscape, moving beyond traditional stores to include unconventional tenants like churches, bowling alleys, and yoga studios. Facing vacancies from the decline of anchor stores like Sears, mall owners are subdividing large spaces for a mix of entertainment, community, and niche retail businesses. This strategy aims to create "cross-shopping" opportunities and re-establish malls as community hubs. Data suggests the approach is working, with increased foot traffic driven by experiences rather than just shopping, signaling a potential rebirth for the once-struggling enclosed mall.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teen named Logan Coleridge experienced debilitating symptoms like dizziness and severe headaches that persisted for months. When physical therapy failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. Doctors believe the AVM, not the concussion, was the likely root cause of his long-term symptoms. Logan underwent successful brain surgery to remove the AVM and is now recovering, with his family advocating for earlier diagnostic imaging to prevent similar prolonged suffering.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece remembers Sandra Grimes, the dedicated CIA analyst who played a pivotal role in unmasking one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, Aldrich Ames. In 1991, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs revealed a pattern linking Ames's meetings with a Soviet official to large cash deposits in his bank account. Her work was crucial to the 1994 arrest of Ames, who had compromised numerous intelligence assets. Grimes, who passed away recently at 79, is remembered for her persistence and dedication.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco-based startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons produced during nuclear fusion. The theory, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that tweaking atoms during the fusion process could transmute other metals into gold. This would not be the primary goal, but rather a way to generate revenue to offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion energy. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at exorbitant costs, this proposal aims to make it a viable, albeit radioactive, byproduct of a clean energy source.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by separating its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business. In a letter, Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, undervaluing it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm contends that the high-growth, high-margin DAT segment is a "hidden gem" whose value is suppressed by the main communications business. Carronade suggests a spin-off or IPO of the DAT unit could lead to a significant increase in the company's overall valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

Both Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised President Trump's role in facilitating the breakthrough.

While OpenAI touted its latest model as its smartest and fastest yet, with PhD-level expertise and built-in "thinking" functions, some Chinese tech experts have been less impressed. One prominent AI blogger described GPT-5 as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs or memorable characteristics. The lukewarm reviews come as Chinese tech companies are rapidly developing their own advanced AI models, highlighting the heightened competition and high expectations within the industry for truly groundbreaking advancements.</p>
