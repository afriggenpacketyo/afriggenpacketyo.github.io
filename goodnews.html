          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, ruling that his detention was unusual and unjustified.  Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March and his attorneys argued that his detention violated his free speech rights.  The government plans to appeal the decision, citing allegations that Khalil omitted details from his green card application. The judge rejected this as a sufficient basis for continued detention, highlighting the lack of evidence of violence or incitement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against ordering Trump administration officials to recover deleted Signal messages, stating that recovering already-deleted messages is not redressable.  However, the judge ordered officials to preserve any remaining messages that might be at risk of deletion.  The lawsuit, filed by American Oversight, alleges violations of federal records law due to the use of Signal's auto-delete function. The ruling sparks debate over the handling of classified information and the use of private messaging apps for official government business.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is largely centered around President Trump's demands for increased defense spending from European allies.  Secretary General Mark Rutte has worked to accommodate Trump's preferences, resulting in a shorter summit agenda.  While the summit aims to present a united front, divisions remain on issues such as trade and the Middle East conflict.  Trump's consistent pressure has led to increased defense spending in some European countries, but many will struggle to meet the new targets.</p>
