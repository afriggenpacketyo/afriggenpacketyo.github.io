          <p>A new mural attributed to the elusive street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a grounded protester, a theme that appears to critique the legal system's handling of public demonstrations, particularly following recent mass arrests. Shortly after Banksy authenticated the piece on Instagram, court officials covered it and stated it would be removed, citing the building's listed status which requires its original character to be maintained. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident as potential criminal damage.</p>

          <p>Following her best singles performance at the U.S. Open since 2019, tennis player Taylor Townsend reflected on her personal growth and on-court experiences. In an interview, she stated that the tournament showcased her increased self-worth and how she wants to present herself to the world. Townsend also addressed post-match comments from opponent Jelena Ostapenko, who later apologized, expressing compassion but emphasizing that she does not tolerate disrespect. The 29-year-old athlete credited her 4-year-old son as her primary motivation, explaining that motherhood provided a necessary space from the sport that allowed her to rediscover her love for the game.</p>

          <p>European stock markets closed higher on Monday, showing resilience as investors monitored significant political developments in France. The focus was on a parliamentary confidence vote that was widely expected to oust Prime Minister Francois Bayrou over his controversial budget cuts, a development that could force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint his fifth prime minister in under two years. Despite the potential for increased political instability in the Eurozone's second-largest economy, major indices like France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX posted solid gains, with retail stocks leading the upward trend across the continent.

After undergoing extensive rehabilitation to learn to speak and sing again, Blevins has now been declared to have no evidence of disease for a full year. He credits his medical team and his passion for singing as central to his recovery.

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX has announced a $17 billion cash-and-stock deal to purchase wireless spectrum from satellite TV provider EchoStar. This acquisition will give SpaceX valuable licenses to significantly boost the cellular capabilities of its Starlink satellite network, enabling it to provide service directly to standard mobile phones worldwide. The move is a major step in SpaceX's mission to eliminate mobile dead zones and could position the company to offer its own global mobile services. For EchoStar, which owns the struggling Dish Network, the deal provides immediate financial and regulatory relief.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues 'Hamilton' Film Release is a Timely Political Statement</h2>

          <p>The theatrical release of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical "Hamilton" is being framed as a significant cultural and political counter-narrative to the current political climate in the United States. This article argues that the film's diverse casting and pro-immigrant themes serve as a powerful rebuke to the anti-DEI and anti-immigrant rhetoric of the Trump administration. By telling the story of the nation's founding with actors of color, the production inherently challenges a whitewashed version of American history. Its arrival on the big screen amplifies its message of inclusivity at a time of intense national debate over diversity and historical narratives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid signs of a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are advising student loan borrowers on how to manage their debt if they become unemployed. For federal loan holders, options include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly payments to as little as $0 based on income, including unemployment benefits. Other relief measures like Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment can temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Borrowers with private loans have fewer options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to inquire about potential assistance programs.</p>
