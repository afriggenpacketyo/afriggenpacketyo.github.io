          <h2>Koizumi's Rice Price Cut Push Resurfaces Reformist Image in Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 19:34:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, is spearheading an initiative to lower rice prices amidst rising household burdens, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move comes after Koizumi's unsuccessful leadership race, where he was perceived as lacking experience. Analysts suggest his communication skills and reformist approach could be beneficial for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as they face a national election with public frustration over price hikes. Koizumi has implemented measures such as releasing government rice stockpiles at half the market value, drawing attention to agricultural sector issues, aiming to capture the public's imagination and potentially boosting his leadership prospects within the LDP.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials have created a curfew exemption for ticket holders of indoor events and performing arts venues downtown, including the Music Center, allowing evening performances to proceed. This decision follows reports of declining patronage for arts organizations, restaurants, and other businesses due to the 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in the civic center area. Center Theatre Group canceled performances due to the curfew, while L.A. Opera announced that its performances would continue as planned, advising attendees to carry their tickets as proof of attendance. Major protests are planned, prompting some venues to close for the weekend.</p>

He is expected to attend the US Army's 250th anniversary celebrations and is likely to travel to US Central Command's headquarters in Florida. The visit is expected to include high-level meetings at the State Department and the Pentagon, with analysts suggesting that Munir's acceptance of the invitation indicates Islamabad's desire to recalibrate its relationship with Washington.</p>
