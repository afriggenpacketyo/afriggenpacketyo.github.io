          <p>After a nearly three-year slump, the market for initial public offerings is showing signs of recovery, offering encouragement to venture capital firms awaiting returns. This revival is highlighted by the strong performance of cryptocurrency company Circle, whose market capitalization has surged to $42 billion since its debut. While the largest private tech companies remain on the sidelines, an increase in smaller IPOs and strong post-debut gains by firms like CoreWeave suggest the industry's "liquidity drought" may be easing. Investors are cautiously optimistic, hoping for continued economic stability to sustain the trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A board-certified cardiologist with over two decades of experience has outlined five food categories he avoids giving his children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the lining, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of their link to heart disease. The doctor also advises against sugary cereals and drinks, which can cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods prepared in reused industrial oils. He recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, marking a triumphant return after being banned from the previous year's event. Chestnut consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes to secure his victory, well ahead of the second-place finisher. The 41-year-old expressed his excitement to be back at the iconic Coney Island competition, though he fell short of his own 2021 world record of 76. In the women's competition, reigning champion Miki Sudo captured her 11th title by eating 33 hot dogs and buns.</p>

          <p>For the first time, visitors at Exmoor Zoo in the UK can see a five-month-old female honey badger, a rare birth for the species in captivity. Zookeepers had kept the baby's arrival a secret since her birth in January to allow the mother and cub to bond without stress, which can sometimes lead to rejection. The cub, who is believed to be only the second honey badger born in captivity in the UK, does not yet have a name. The zoo plans to run a naming competition on social media to involve the public.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary, acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns has described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history. In an interview, Burns argued that the revolution's greatest achievement was the creation of the "citizen," a new concept in a world previously dominated by subjects under monarchical rule. He emphasized that while the Declaration of Independence's promise of equality did not initially include women, people of color, or the poor, its inspirational words set in motion global movements for liberty. His upcoming film, "The American Revolution," aims to explore these complex stories.</p>

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Donald Trump suggested a novel way to celebrate America's 250th anniversary next year: hosting a UFC fight on the White House lawn. Trump stated that he envisions an octagon ring being set up on the grounds for a full championship event in front of 20,000 to 25,000 people. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the proposed event. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major sporting event of this nature has been held at the White House.</p>

          <p>Nutrition experts highlight that unsweetened iced tea is a healthy, hydrating beverage that offers numerous benefits. As a calorie-free drink with no sugar, sodium, or fat, it serves as a flavorful alternative to water for maintaining hydration. Teas from the Camellia sinensis plant, such as green, black, and oolong, contain antioxidants and the amino acid L-theanine, which can help reduce the risk of chronic illnesses and promote relaxation. Herbal teas like hibiscus and chamomile offer additional benefits, such as supporting healthy blood pressure and providing stress relief, making tea a beneficial part of a daily routine.</p>

          <p>The market share of Chinese-made cars in the United Kingdom has seen significant growth, with one in every ten new cars sold in June originating from China. This represents a substantial increase from 6% in the same month last year, driven by the rapid expansion of brands like BYD, MG, and Omoda. The surge comes at a time when other Western nations have imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports. The UK's lack of similar tariffs, combined with the popularity of electric vehicles, has created a major opportunity for Chinese manufacturers to expand their presence.</p>

          <p>The Ethereum blockchain is increasingly becoming the foundational plumbing for Wall Street's future, a trend highlighted at the recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes. Major financial institutions like Deutsche Bank are building tokenization platforms on Ethereum-based networks, while companies like Robinhood are launching on-chain tokenized stocks. This shift towards utility is driven by Ethereum's reputation for stability and security, which institutional players value for core financial transactions. Despite price volatility, the focus on building real-world financial infrastructure signals a maturing of the crypto ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>
