          <p>The United States and China have agreed in principle on a framework to implement a consensus reached on resolving trade disputes. The agreement followed two days of talks in London, building on negotiations from Geneva last month which suspended tariffs for 90 days. The framework addresses disputes over semiconductors, visas for Chinese students, and rare earth minerals, aiming to open China to U.S. products. Both sides will now brief their leaders for approval before implementation (not investment advice).</p>
