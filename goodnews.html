          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to elevate their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a potential improvement in relations after a period of strain. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who expressed China's willingness to assist in improving Afghanistan-Pakistan relations. Relations between the two countries have been tense due to Pakistan's accusations that Afghanistan harbors the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. The move is expected to enhance bilateral cooperation across various sectors, although no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021. </p>

          <p>A rare gold lobster, estimated to occur in only one in 30 million, was saved from being cooked at a restaurant in Charlestown, Rhode Island. A cook at the Nordic Lodge Restaurant noticed the lobster, named Calvin, among a delivery of other lobsters and recognized its unique genetic mutation. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center in North Kingstown, where it is now on display. The center's director noted that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange lobsters, but that Calvin's distinct coloration made him stand out. </p>

Overton sustained the injury while attempting to catch a ball during the series opener at Edgbaston, although he returned to bowl and took three wickets. He is expected to be sidelined for approximately a month, which will also cause him to miss the three T20 matches against West Indies. Matthew Potts has been selected to replace Overton in the England XI, marking his first ODI appearance since September. </p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth advocating for gender-neutral fitness standards for all combat jobs. This shift follows the 2015 decision to open all combat jobs to women, leading to the integration of women into roles such as Army infantry officers and Ranger School graduates. Captain Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer, recounts her experiences at Ranger School, emphasizing that she met the same standards as her male counterparts. She believes that gender-neutral standards are important but that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. </p>

          <p>The situation in the Swiss L√∂tschental valley has eased following a rock fall and glacier collapse, with the Lonza River finding new paths down the valley. Construction machinery has been deployed to manage the run-off of accumulated water, reducing the risk of a flood wave. Residents remain on alert due to forecast rain, which could lead to a buildup of water and further landslides. The glacier collapse, triggered by rockfalls, sent millions of cubic meters of ice and rock through the valley, burying the evacuated village of Blatten, which officials plan to rebuild. </p>

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and congestion. The ¬£2bn upgrade project, designed to improve connectivity and boost prosperity in the region, has been described as one of the UK's most expensive and complex road projects. The 28-mile improvement is designed to cut journey times between west Wales and the Midlands, but the project has faced numerous delays and cost overruns. Despite the challenges, officials said the upgraded road will benefit communities across the region. </p>

          <p>Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland are calling for a more assertive Democratic Party that emphasizes the political gravity of the moment and engages with diverse constituencies. Both governors, speaking at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry, denied any plans of seeking the presidential nomination in 2028, but stressed the importance of focusing on the present. Moore emphasized the need to deliver an alternative to Trump, while Walz urged Democrats to compete in every district and school board seat. Clyburn praised both governors as great leaders. </p>
