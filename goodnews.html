          <p>A recent report indicates that U.S. homeowners have reached record levels of home equity, with nearly 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable funds. The average homeowner holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains how homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value, noting that lenders typically allow borrowing up to 80% of this amount. While options like home equity loans and HELOCs are available, homeowners are cautioned against overborrowing as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman advises that succeeding in the age of artificial intelligence will depend less on technical knowledge and more on soft skills, particularly critical thinking. He emphasizes that as AI tools handle more administrative tasks, the ability for humans to think creatively, adapt to new technologies, and make nuanced judgments will become paramount. Garman told his own teenage child that developing critical thinking is the most important aspect of a college education, regardless of the major. He also highlighted adaptability and effective communication as essential skills where humans will continue to hold an advantage over AI.</p>

          <p>Chinese mining giant Ganfeng Lithium has partnered with Swiss-based Lithium Argentina to develop a major lithium extraction project in South America. The joint venture aims to produce the equivalent of 150,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually from high-altitude brine in northwest Argentina. This collaboration intensifies the global competition for lithium, a critical metal for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage. The partnership is expected to provide advanced technology, financial flexibility, and significant operational synergies, strengthening the global lithium supply chain for both companies involved in the project.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks rallied significantly on Wednesday, outperforming the broader market as investors grow more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. The Russell 2000 index gained over 1%, while the S&P 500 remained flat, held back by a slide in large technology stocks. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies that rely on borrowing for operations and expansion. This market rotation comes as traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, spurred by recent weaker-than-expected labor market data.

          <p>In the second-round draw for the 2025-26 Carabao Cup, Manchester United has been slated to play an away match against League Two team Grimsby Town. This fixture is notable as United is without European competition for the first time in eleven seasons. Another highlight from the draw includes League Two's Bromley, who defeated Championship side Ipswich, hosting League One's Wycombe. The draw also set up two all-Premier League matchups: Bournemouth will host Brentford, and Wolves will play West Ham at home, setting the stage for some compelling early-season cup football.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking 1,019,837 container units in July, the highest monthly volume in its 117-year history. This surge was driven by shippers front-loading cargo from China to get ahead of impending tariff deadlines, which have since been extended. While the port operated without delays, logistics experts note that this early peak season has been less robust than normal, with a notable pullback in the retail sector. The data suggests that while companies rushed to import goods, the high tariff levels prevented them from placing full orders, indicating a potential slowdown ahead.</p>

          <h2>New Budget Bill Expands Allowable Uses for 529 College Savings Plans</h2>

          <p>A recently passed budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, making them more powerful tools for education-related expenses. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a broader range of costs, including vocational programs, required continuing education for professionals, and licensing exam preparation. This expansion addresses a common concern among parents that their child might not use the funds for a traditional college degree. The changes, along with a provision allowing rollovers to an IRA, make 529 plans a more versatile and appealing option for long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Social Security Benefits May See a 2.7% Cost-of-Living Increase in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 14:37:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new estimate from the Senior Citizens League projects that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This prediction, based on the latest inflation data, suggests a slightly higher increase than the 2.5% adjustment received in the current year. The Social Security Administration calculates the annual COLA based on inflation data from the third quarter to ensure benefits keep pace with rising prices. However, some economists express concern that a modest adjustment may not be sufficient if inflation, potentially driven by tariffs, accelerates later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Stocks like UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly bounced back, driving a notable advance for the healthcare sector, which has been down for the year. In contrast, major AI-related stocks such as Nvidia and Broadcom pulled back from recent highs. The article suggests the AI pause may be linked to the earnings outlook from CoreWeave, which indicated that its capital expenditure is currently constrained by power availability rather than a decline in demand.

          <p>A new study of a khipu, the knotted-cord record-keeping system of the Inca Empire, suggests the practice may have been more widespread than previously believed. Researchers analyzed a primary cord made entirely of human hair and determined from its chemical composition that its creator had a diet of a commoner, not a ruling elite. This discovery challenges the long-held assumption that khipu production was exclusively the domain of high-status individuals. The finding provides evidence for continuity between ancient Incan khipus and more modern versions made by lower-status people, potentially rewriting the understanding of Incan literacy.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the potential earnings for a $75,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current economic climate, where rates remain attractive. With fixed rates, savers can precisely calculate their returns, which are substantial for a large deposit, ranging from nearly $800 on a 3-month CD to over $16,000 on a 5-year CD. The article notes that since CD rates are locked in, they offer protection against potential future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. This makes CDs a compelling option for savers who are comfortable parting with their money for a set term in exchange for guaranteed returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has expanded its employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, as concerns about inflation rise due to tariffs. The 10% discount, which previously applied mainly to produce and general merchandise, will now be available for 95% of store items for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. In a memo, Walmart's chief people officer stated the expansion was a direct response to employee feedback and is one of the company's most requested benefits. The move could help retain workers and encourage them to spend more at Walmart, while also addressing their financial concerns about rising prices.</p>
