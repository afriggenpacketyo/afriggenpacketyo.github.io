          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known for his humble lifestyle and leftist ideals, has died at the age of 89. Serving from 2010 to 2015, Mujica refused a presidential salary and estate, choosing to live on a farm and donate most of his income to housing for the poor. As a former member of the Tupamaro guerrilla movement, he spent over a decade in prison before entering mainstream politics. During his presidency, Uruguay legalized gay marriage, abortion, and marijuana, solidifying his legacy as a progressive leader. He championed rural communities and advocated for a more egalitarian society, leaving a lasting impact on Uruguay and Latin America.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, suggesting Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to Arab countries for civilian use. This proposal, intended as a permanent solution, seeks to alleviate concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and offers a potential framework for a new agreement with the United States.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled his new cabinet, promising "decisive action" on his economic agenda amidst a trade war with the US. The new cabinet includes a new foreign minister and trade ministers to handle the US-Canada relationship. There are 24 new faces in cabinet, including 13 first-time MPs. Veteran member of parliament (MP), Dominic LeBlanc, who has overseen a number of cabinet positions, most recently international trade, will now focus on Canada-US trade and breaking down internal trade barriers within the country. The new cabinet will have to deal with the tariffs imposed by President Trump.</p>

          <h2>Inflation Rate Rises in April, CPI Report Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Housing costs and energy prices were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices dropped slightly. Economists are monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices. The report may influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rate cuts, with some analysts suggesting a possible delay in rate cuts due to the uncertain economic outlook.

          <p>Disney Entertainment Co-Chair Dana Walden outlined the company's strategy for leveraging its linear television arm and bundling streaming services. Disney views its linear channels as a way to program for audiences still watching traditional TV, with content then windowed onto streaming platforms. Walden emphasized the importance of sports programming on linear TV and the success of Disney's bundling strategy, which includes a new stand-alone ESPN streaming service heavily discounted when bundled with Disney+ and Hulu. Walden says Disney has a "unique ecosystem" that sets it apart from the competition.</p>
