          <p>President Trump suggested a willingness to lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks in Switzerland, a significant reduction from the current 145% on many Chinese goods. The Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is expected to engage with Chinese counterparts to potentially foster trade stability. Despite this, Trump emphasized the need for China to open its markets to the U.S., as closed markets are no longer viable. The latest data reveals a substantial decline in goods moving from China to the U.S., raising concerns about potential price increases and shortages.</p>
