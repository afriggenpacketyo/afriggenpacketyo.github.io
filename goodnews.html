        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe has achieved a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the United States, positioning them to retain the Ryder Cup with just 2.5 points needed from the final 12 singles matches. This historic advantage represents Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, achieved through an "imperious" team performance. The event, however, was overshadowed by "thuggish" and personal insults from American galleries directed particularly at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to multiple ejections and a notable decline in Sunday ticket prices. Despite the challenging atmosphere and some on-course altercations, the European team, including key players like Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood, demonstrated remarkable resilience and skill to dominate the sessions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30 years as a swing justice, particularly his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion. Kennedy asserts that "the cases swung, not me," reflecting his evolving interpretations of liberty over time, rather than a change in his core judicial philosophy. He expresses concern about increasing partisanship in the judiciary and society, advocating for more respectful discourse. The article highlights his personal journey on contentious issues, including a reconciliation with Justice Scalia after their disagreement on gay marriage, and his nuanced stance on originalism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging remains a subject of debate among dermatologists and consumers. While some users report benefits like brighter skin and stronger hair, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism about collagen's ability to reach skin cells after oral consumption, even in peptide form. Topical collagen creams are deemed ineffective as they don't penetrate the dermis. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, contrasting with independent research that finds no significant effect. Experts emphasize that sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after establishing formal diplomatic relations, China's rapid technological advancement is prompting questions about whether it has surpassed Europe in the race for a hi-tech future. A 1970s European delegation, observing China's industrial and scientific landscape, estimated the country was decades behind. However, China's subsequent reform and opening-up policies fueled decades of exponential growth, transforming it into a global technological powerhouse. This shift underscores a dramatic reversal of fortunes, highlighting China's successful modernization efforts and its current competitive edge in key technological sectors.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election, aiming to deliver 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce identified Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as initial promising sites among 12 recommendations across England. This initiative, central to Labour's economic growth vision, will establish development corporations with special planning powers to invest in infrastructure like GP surgeries and schools. The government also welcomed a recommendation for at least 40% affordable housing in these new communities, drawing inspiration from post-war Labour housing booms.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that China's global initiatives could provide the necessary reform for the United Nations, which its General Assembly President described as being at a "make-it-or-break-it moment." The piece highlights contradictions within the UN's current state, pointing to major powers like Germany and the U.S. as enablers of conflict through arms supplies. It implies that a shift towards new global frameworks, potentially championed by China, could address the UN's current challenges and move towards a more equitable and effective international body, rather than maintaining existing power dynamics that contribute to global instability.</p>
