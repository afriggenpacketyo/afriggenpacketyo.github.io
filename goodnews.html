          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have responded positively to the Trump administration's proposal to raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000. In a joint interview, both tech leaders framed the policy as a way to attract the world's most talented individuals to the United States. Huang emphasized that immigration is fundamental to the 'American Dream,' while Altman noted that streamlining the process with financial incentives seems beneficial. This policy change represents a major shift for the tech and finance sectors, which heavily rely on the H-1B program to hire skilled workers, particularly from India and China.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's order to halt construction on the Revolution Wind farm, allowing Danish energy company Orsted to resume work. The project, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and poised to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted had sued the Interior Department, arguing the stop-work order was unlawful and issued in bad faith. Judge Royce Lamberth granted a temporary injunction, stating Orsted was likely to succeed on the merits of its case, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

The company stated the initial decision was made to avoid inflaming a tense situation following Kimmel's comments on the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, the network decided to resume production. The suspension had drawn widespread criticism and prompted an open letter signed by over 400 Hollywood stars defending free speech and arguing against what they called government pressure on media companies, making the situation a focal point in the debate over censorship.</p>

Under the proposed structure, the company would have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle overseeing security, including the app's powerful algorithm. A senior official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, although Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order extending the pause on the ban-or-sale law by 120 days to allow time for the deal to be finalized.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates on a downward trend and the possibility of another Federal Reserve rate cut in October, prospective homebuyers are advised to take strategic steps. While waiting for rates to potentially fall further, experts suggest getting pre-approved for a loan after carefully checking one's credit report for any inaccuracies. Additionally, researching and selecting an experienced real estate agent can provide a competitive edge in a market that may see increased buyer activity. Comparing lenders and loan terms in advance will also position buyers to act quickly and effectively when favorable rates become available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Automaker Stellantis is conducting real-world tests on a new electric vehicle battery technology called IBIS (Intelligent Battery Integrated System) that could significantly improve performance. Developed with battery company Saft, the system embeds the inverter and charging components directly into the battery pack, making it more compact, lighter, and more efficient. The technology, currently being tested in a Peugeot e-3008, is claimed to boost motor output and overall efficiency by up to 10% while reducing battery weight by 40kg. Stellantis anticipates this groundbreaking technology could be integrated into its production vehicles by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>In response to California's escalating home insurance crisis, the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog has proposed a ballot initiative called the "Insurance Policyholder Bill of Rights." The measure would compel insurers to offer coverage to homeowners who implement wildfire mitigation measures or face a five-year ban on selling any home or auto insurance in the state. This proposal comes as a counter to a separate initiative, backed by an insurance broker, that seeks to roll back key provisions of the state's existing insurance regulations. The dueling proposals highlight the intense battle over how to address rising premiums and reduced coverage in the fire-prone state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. Currently, a $100,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term at an average rate of 8.43% would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,236. For a 15-year term at 8.31%, the payment would be around $974. While these costs are only marginally lower than earlier in the year, further anticipated rate cuts could lead to more significant savings, making home equity loans an increasingly attractive option for accessing large sums of cash.

The letter describes the situation as a "dark moment for freedom of speech," arguing that the government pressured a private company into silencing a critic. Signatories include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. The controversy began after Kimmel criticized the conservative response to the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk, which led to the FCC chairman threatening regulatory action against the network, sparking a nationwide debate on censorship.</p>
