          <p>Roche and Zealand Pharma have entered a $5.3 billion agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide amylin analog, a next-generation weight loss drug. This move signifies Roche's ambition to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the growing obesity treatment market. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, potentially offering better tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs. The deal involves upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments, and both companies will share development and commercialization responsibilities, emphasizing a collaborative partnership.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage’s Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, northwest England, unseating the Labour Party by a mere six votes. This outcome suggests a rising influence for Farage and his anti-immigration party, potentially reshaping the British political landscape. The victory, attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment and concerns over immigration, marks Reform's first parliamentary by-election win. The article highlights the close margin, voter frustration, and the potential implications for both the Labour and Conservative parties in upcoming municipal elections.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is expressing concerns about Europe's reliance on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard, particularly in light of Donald Trump's return to power. ECB President Christine Lagarde is advocating for greater European independence in digital payments to mitigate potential risks to European security. While some experts downplay the dominance of US systems, the rise of app-based payments led by American tech firms is also raising concerns.

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent UK elections, winning its first Parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby and its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire. The party's success, led by figures like Sarah Pochin and Andrea Jenkyns, indicates a growing challenge to the dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. While Labour held onto mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, Reform made strong showings in those races as well.

          <p>China is easing restrictions on K-pop acts, signaling a potential shift in economic strategy amid trade tensions with the U.S. The decision to allow K-pop concerts and events is seen as a way to revitalize domestic demand and stimulate spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce. K-pop's digital nature makes it tariff-proof, as core revenue drivers like streaming and fan content are immune to cross-border tariffs. This move also aligns with China's efforts to restore ties with neighboring countries and diversify cultural offerings, potentially benefiting K-pop stocks and fostering regional goodwill.</p>
