          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated revenue from its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. Despite a year-over-year decline in net income, the bank's performance was robust, with trading operations benefiting from market volatility. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results but reiterated warnings about persistent economic risks, including trade uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The bank also raised its full-year guidance for net interest income, signaling confidence in its continued profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that the U.S. has secured a "great deal" with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. The announcement, which Trump said followed direct talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, did not include any specific details about the terms of the agreement. This follows a similar pattern to a recent announcement regarding a trade deal with Vietnam, where the details were initially sparse and later faced reporting that Vietnamese officials were surprised by the description. The White House has not yet provided further information on the matter.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is set to vote on two significant pieces of cryptocurrency legislation, marking a potentially pivotal week for the industry in Washington. The GENUIS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, is expected to become law, while the more comprehensive CLARITY Act faces a more uncertain path. The CLARITY Act aims to define regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC but faces Democratic concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump's family's crypto ventures. The crypto industry, including major players like Coinbase, is heavily lobbying for the bills' passage to establish clear regulatory frameworks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, driven by a 16% year-over-year increase in markets revenue and an 18% rise in banking revenue. The bank's net income climbed 25% from the previous year, reflecting strong performance in a volatile market period. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the success of the bank's strategy, although the company did increase its allowance for credit losses, citing a "deterioration" in the economic outlook. Following the strong report, Citigroup raised its full-year revenue guidance and recently increased its quarterly dividend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips, which are used for developing artificial intelligence, to customers in China. CEO Jensen Huang announced the decision in Beijing, stating that licenses would be granted for the shipments to begin soon. This move reverses previous restrictions aimed at preventing China from using advanced U.S. technology for military purposes. The decision follows intense lobbying from tech leaders who argued that the export controls hindered U.S. competitiveness in the critical Chinese market and could push other nations toward China's AI ecosystem.</p>

Scheffler emphasized that his family is his true priority, vowing to quit the sport if it ever negatively impacted his home life with his wife and son.

          <p>With potential mortgage rate cuts on the horizon later this year, experts advise prospective homebuyers to prepare now to be in a strong position. Key recommendations include conducting thorough research on the homebuying process, improving one's credit score by paying down debt and ensuring on-time payments, and exploring different loan features beyond just the interest rate. Experts caution against trying to perfectly time the market, as a drop in rates could increase buyer competition and drive up home prices. The consensus is that finding the right house is more important than waiting for the perfect rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have detected the largest black hole merger ever observed, resulting in a new black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The discovery, made by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration using gravitational waves, challenges current understanding of how such massive black holes form. The two merging black holes were themselves unusually large, and researchers noted they were spinning at near the maximum speed allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. This event, dubbed GW231123, is pushing the limits of theoretical models and opening new avenues for astronomical research.</p>
