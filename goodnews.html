          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced it will be raising the subscription prices for its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN streaming services, with changes taking effect on October 21. For example, the ad-free Disney+ plan will increase from $15.99 to $18.99 per month, while various bundled packages will also see price hikes of $2 to $3. This move follows similar price increases by competitors like Netflix and Apple, reflecting a broader industry trend of adjusting subscription costs to improve profitability. The company noted that its flagship Disney+ service added 1.8 million subscribers in the last quarter, bringing its total to 128 million.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, some homeowners are considering using a home equity loan to finance the purchase of a second property. This financial strategy requires careful evaluation of the current interest rate environment, as today's rates are still higher than in the recent past. Homeowners should also precisely calculate their available equity and determine if it's sufficient for a down payment to avoid private mortgage insurance. Ultimately, the decision should align with long-term financial goals, weighing the benefits of leveraging home equity against the risks involved in taking on new debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During his address at the United Nations, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva strongly criticized the United States for its trade tariffs and military policies, while advocating for stronger ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected olive branch shortly after the speech. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had a brief but positive interaction, describing their chemistry as "excellent" and announcing they had agreed to a formal meeting next week. This surprising development suggests a potential diplomatic opening despite the evident tensions between the two administrations.</p>

          <p>Half a century after her iconic song "Lovin' You" topped the charts, the late Minnie Riperton's influence continues to resonate within the music industry. A tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl, featuring artists like Stevie Wonder and George Benson, will honor her enduring legacy. Riperton, known for her five-octave vocal range and serene musical style, tragically passed away from breast cancer at age 31, just a few years after achieving mainstream success. Her work, which blended soul, pop, and psychedelic elements, has been sampled by numerous artists and continues to inspire a new generation of musicians with its unique combination of subtlety and power.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on a forested property in Pembroke, Maine. The property owner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Rescuers sedated the moose, secured it with straps, and used an excavator to carefully lift it out of the well in an operation that took five hours. After the sedative wore off, the moose was able to run off, seemingly unharmed by the ordeal, leaving rescuers and the family relieved.</p>

          <p>Leading global health organizations, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, have publicly rejected President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen is linked to autism. Health officials reiterated that scientific evidence does not support a causal relationship and that the drug remains a crucial and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. They warned that avoiding necessary treatment could pose significant health risks. The UK's health secretary explicitly advised the public not to heed Trump's medical statements, emphasizing the lack of evidence for his assertions about both acetaminophen and vaccines.</p>

          <p>England has named its squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers since the victorious 1970-71 tour. The attack, led by Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, is designed to counter Australia's traditional strengths on home soil with sheer pace. While there are durability concerns surrounding several key bowlers, including captain Ben Stokes, the selection signals a clear strategic shift away from the medium-pace bowlers who have struggled in past Australian campaigns. The team's success will likely depend on this aggressive bowling unit staying fit and starting the series strongly.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, will be tried for all seven alleged murders in a single trial. Heuermann's defense team had argued for separate trials, claiming that the evidence for the different charges varied significantly and could prejudice the jury. However, prosecutors contended that the cases were linked by a common modus operandi and Heuermann's familiarity with the locations where the victims' remains were discovered. The judge also denied a defense motion to exclude advanced DNA evidence, setting a deadline of January 2026 for further pretrial motions.</p>

Prosecutors successfully argued that Routh demonstrated clear intent and took substantial steps towards the attack, even though no shots were fired from his rifle. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to harm himself with a pen in the courtroom before being subdued by U.S. Marshals. Acting as his own attorney, Routh had argued that he lacked the capacity to kill and never intended to complete the act.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has officially approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. The system will be implemented through a challenge format, where human umpires will still make the initial calls, but each team can challenge two ball or strike calls per game. Teams will retain their challenge if it is successful, and reviews will be displayed on stadium videoboards. The technology, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, aims to increase accuracy and is expected to reduce ejections related to disputes over balls and strikes.</p>

          <p>The Medigap "birthday rule," a provision available in about 18 states, offers a valuable opportunity for Medicare beneficiaries to switch their supplemental insurance plans annually without medical underwriting. This state-specific rule typically provides a window around a person's birthday during which they can switch to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits, regardless of pre-existing health conditions. This allows seniors to seek more affordable premiums or better service without being locked into their initial plan choice. Understanding the specific regulations in one's state is crucial for taking advantage of this potential for significant cost savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With average home equity levels high, many homeowners are considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for significant expenses. For a $60,000 HELOC at the current average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year repayment period or $575 for a 15-year period. These costs are slightly lower than earlier in the year due to the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. A key advantage of a HELOC is its variable rate, which could lead to even lower payments if further rate cuts occur as anticipated later this year. (not investment advice)</p>
