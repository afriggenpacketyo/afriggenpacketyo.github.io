          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals with experience in destinations like the Maldives and Bali, shared their insights on the realities of working in paradise. They emphasize that resort life for employees is quite different from the vacation experience, often involving long periods of being confined to a staff village with its own unique social dynamics. Managing a multicultural workforce and addressing maintenance challenges caused by saltwater or humidity are also key aspects of their roles. The couple also highlighted the challenge of living far from family, but they've adapted by traveling home annually and adopting two dogs.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation into alleged hateful comments directed at Chicago Sky star Angel Reese after a game against the Indiana Fever, the WNBA announced it could not substantiate the claims. The investigation was prompted by reports of racist remarks made by fans after Reese was fouled by Caitlin Clark. Reese had previously accused Clark's fans of racism and claimed they created AI-generated explicit images of her. Despite the league's finding, Reese stated she received support from across the league, emphasizing that there's no place for hate speech in the WNBA.</p>

          <p>Savannah Chrisley expressed her gratitude after President Donald Trump pardoned her parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. Savannah stated that Trump personally called her to deliver the news, granting her parents a "fresh start" with a full unconditional pardon. Todd and Julie Chrisley were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution. The charges stemmed from fraudulent activity dating back to at least 2007.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vanguard's new research indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing even high income or asset levels. The study, surveying over 12,000 Vanguard investors, found that this amount provides confidence in handling unexpected expenses, with the median emergency costing around $2,000. People with emergency savings also spend less time worrying about their finances each week. While saving $2,000 may be challenging for some, starting small and automating savings can make a significant difference (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted, shooting lava fountains over 1,000 feet into the air in a six-hour display. The eruption, the 23rd in a series since December 2024, occurred within a closed area of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, posing no immediate threat to nearby communities. However, officials warned of hazards such as sulfur dioxide emissions, volcanic smog, and strands of volcanic glass that can irritate skin and eyes. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory anticipate another eruption soon, following the volcano's pattern of erupting approximately once per week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is trying to locate residents who lost their homes in the Palisades or Eaton fires and are owed property tax refunds due to the reassessment of their damaged properties. The county has sent out roughly 9,700 checks totaling $26 million, but about 330 remain undeliverable because the U.S. Postal Service could not reach vacant or destroyed homes. County officials are urging displaced residents to update their mailing addresses to ensure they receive their refunds. The county assessor's office has obtained new addresses for residents who filed tax relief claims, but other eligible households have not filed, creating address gaps.</p>

He noted that police forces are carrying the "scar tissue of years of austerity cuts" and need more resources to meet the government's commitments.
