          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper is gaining traction in the satellite internet market, securing its first contract with JetBlue to provide in-flight WiFi starting in 2027, challenging SpaceX's Starlink. While Starlink currently has a significant lead with thousands of satellites in orbit, Amazon's Kuiper project is rapidly expanding its constellation. The satellite internet market is poised for growth, with projections indicating the launch of approximately 70,000 LEO satellites between 2025 and 2031, potentially benefiting billions lacking internet access. The competition between Amazon and SpaceX is expected to drive innovation and expand internet access, particularly in remote and underserved areas, with potential implications for 6G communications.</p>

          <p>Three specialized island-landing vessels, part of the 'Dong Gong' fleet, were observed in mainland China with hull numbers indicating they are in service with the PLA's Eastern Theatre Command. These barges are equipped with legs that extend to the seabed during landing, lifting the craft out of the water for stability. Each vessel features an extended bridge deck and cable-stayed bridge towers, suggesting advanced capabilities for military operations. According to a former Chinese military instructor, the markings confirm their operational status within the PLA's Eastern Theatre Command, enhancing China's amphibious assault capabilities.</p>
