          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 13:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly payments on a new $150,000 home equity loan have decreased slightly. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% would cost approximately $1,847 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be around $1,452 per month. These figures represent a modest saving compared to rates from earlier in the year, translating to potential savings of over $1,900 over a decade. With more rate cuts potentially on the horizon, homeowners may find borrowing against their equity an increasingly attractive option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat expectations, but investors reacted negatively to certain details, causing the stock to fall over 2%. Key concerns included same-store sales growth of 5.7%, which missed estimates of 5.9%, and a slight decline in membership renewal rates. Despite these issues, analysts noted strong points such as a 14% growth in membership fee income and an increase in online signups from a younger demographic. Most Wall Street firms maintained a positive long-term outlook on the company, though many slightly lowered their price targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return over 28,000 fossils, including the historic "Java Man" remains, to Indonesia. These fossils, discovered in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois on the island of Java, were the first known evidence of Homo erectus, a key ancestor of modern humans. The decision follows a recommendation from a committee which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population during the Dutch colonial era. This act of repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past and return culturally significant artifacts to their countries of origin.</p>

          <p>A heartwarming moment at a Seattle Mariners game captured national attention after a fan made an extraordinary gesture of kindness. Glenn Mutti-Driscoll caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball, a collector's item potentially worth six figures, and immediately gifted it to 12-year-old Marcus Rueblos. The young fan then chose to return the ball to Raleigh, stating it meant more to the player, in exchange for a signed bat. The Mariners later located Mutti-Driscoll and also presented him with a signed bat, celebrating a feel-good story that stood in stark contrast to typical scrambles for valuable memorabilia.</p>

          <p>In a series of recent operations in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Coast Guard seized more than $220 million worth of cocaine. The crew of the Cutter Midgett intercepted four separate drug-smuggling vessels, netting over 21,000 pounds of cocaine, while the Cutter Diligence seized another 8,700 pounds from a boat near Panama. The Coast Guard released images showing the seized narcotics being offloaded and one of the alleged drug boats on fire. According to a spokesperson, it is standard procedure to sink these vessels after detaining suspects and securing the drugs to prevent maritime hazards.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York to support the American team on the first day of the prestigious golf tournament against Europe. Accompanied by his granddaughter Kai, the president made an appearance on the first tee as the morning matches were concluding. His presence was met with chants of "U-S-A" from the crowd, and some American players, including top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, suggested that having the president in attendance would provide a boost for the U.S. squad. The visit highlights Trump's continued engagement with the sport of golf.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup, already known as one of golf's most emotionally charged events, is expected to reach a new level of intensity as it takes place at Bethpage Black near New York City. The combination of the tournament's patriotic fervor and the famously vocal New York sports crowds has both teams preparing for a uniquely loud and potentially hostile environment. European players like Rory McIlroy anticipate that "something will happen," and the team has even used virtual reality to simulate the expected noise. The event will test the composure of golfers accustomed to silence, especially those on the visiting European team.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration announced it will allow Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022 following fatal crashes and production defects, with the FAA taking over all certifications directly. Under the new arrangement, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks. The decision signals a degree of renewed regulatory confidence in the manufacturer's quality control, though the agency emphasized that its inspectors will continue to increase surveillance of Boeing's production processes.</p>

          <p>A retirement strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of one's retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or kept liquid for unexpected costs. The strategy aims to provide a balance of financial security and flexibility, reducing stress during market volatility by ensuring a stable, pension-like income stream. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the interest, the program faces potential legal challenges as it was created via executive order, and logistical hurdles remain as there is not yet a formal application process.</p>
