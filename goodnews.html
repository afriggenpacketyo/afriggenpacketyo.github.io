          <p>Actor Johnny Depp joined Alice Cooper on stage during a concert in London for a surprise tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne. Depp played guitar with the band for a performance of Black Sabbath's classic song "Paranoid," just days after the heavy metal icon's passing at age 76. Cooper, who wore an Osbourne t-shirt, introduced Depp as "some guy we found out in the alley." Depp, a fellow member of the band The Hollywood Vampires with Cooper, also stayed on stage to play the classic "School's Out," honoring a musician widely mourned as an unmatched showman and cultural legend.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has significantly expanded its mental health services, now guaranteeing soldiers a consultation with a mental health officer within 24 hours of a request. This initiative addresses the rising psychological distress among troops, including anxiety, sleep disturbances, and PTSD, stemming from the ongoing war. Since October 7, the IDF has enlisted approximately 1,000 mental health officers, many of whom provide support directly on the front lines in Gaza and Lebanon. This increased investment and proactive approach signal a major shift in breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health within the military.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu's run at the Washington Open has ended after she was defeated by Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-final with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya played an aggressive match, securing key breaks in both sets to overcome Raducanu, who had not dropped a set prior to this match. The victory prevents a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez. Instead, Kalinskaya will face Fernandez in the final, aiming to win her first WTA 500 title after Fernandez won her own marathon semi-final against Elena Rybakina.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, an achievement that some modern scholars have dismissed as a myth. Using modern scientific principles and newly discovered clues, the scientists aim to restore the reputation of this ancient wonder. The project seeks to prove the viability of the seismoscope, which was once so revered it was described as being "as accurate as the gods."</p>

          <p>Beyond his legendary music career with Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered as an icon of early 2000s reality television. His family's MTV show, "The Osbournes," which ran from 2002 to 2005, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, offering an unprecedented and often mundane look into a celebrity's home life. Before the Kardashians, the show captured audiences by blending the rock-star lifestyle with relatable family dynamics, portraying Ozzy as a lovable, often-confused father. The Emmy-winning series kicked off a wave of celebrity-driven reality TV, forever changing the television landscape.</p>

His case is on a fast track to sainthood, as the Church has declared him a martyr who died for his faith.

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions people experience during high-stakes games. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an increased heart rate, sleeplessness, and other effects. Experts advise fans to manage these feelings by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and staying nourished. They also suggest that movement can help dissipate nervous energy and that reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience can make the event more positive, regardless of the outcome.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with July's average temperature running about one degree below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. The cool temperatures are a stark contrast to the oppressive heat and wildfires seen in other parts of California. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, experts note that the region's hottest weather often occurs in September, warning that the summer is not yet over.</p>
