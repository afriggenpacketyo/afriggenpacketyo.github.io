          <p>A new medical device is offering hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. The article highlights the story of restaurateur Tommy Fello, who regained significant movement in his left arm after receiving the implant, following months of minimal progress with traditional therapy. Neurosurgeons describe the technology as a first-of-its-kind approach that could redefine possibilities for stroke rehabilitation and help patients reclaim their lives.</p>

          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed to the next generation, wealth advisors highlight the growing potential for financial and emotional conflict among families. The article outlines key strategies to mitigate these issues, such as transferring property through a will or trust to take advantage of a "step-up in basis," which reduces capital gains taxes for heirs. It also recommends placing homes in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) to protect against lawsuits and creating a detailed operating agreement to set clear rules for property use, expenses, and potential buyouts among siblings.

          <h2>Ukrainian President's Wardrobe Shift Signals a Change in Diplomatic Tone</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the concept of "wardrobe diplomacy" through Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House. After a previous meeting where his combat-style attire was criticized by President Trump and some media, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt. This sartorial shift was perceived as a deliberate move to foster a more serious and productive conversation, drawing parallels to Winston Churchill's use of an air-raid suit during a 1941 White House visit. The article suggests that while clothing doesn't define a leader, it can significantly influence the atmosphere of high-stakes diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>The latest season of "South Park" is receiving attention for its direct and unrestrained critique of the Trump administration, a move that comes at a sensitive time for its parent company, Paramount. The article features an interview with media analyst Brian Stelter, who discusses how the show's creators are targeting figures like President Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem with scathing parody. This occurs even as Paramount has been under scrutiny from the administration, raising questions about creative freedom. The show's high ratings and a new billion-dollar streaming deal suggest that its commercial value may be protecting it from political pressure.</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful hurricanes, Florida is seeing a shift toward more resilient construction and community planning. The article highlights Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be "storm-proof," which sustained almost no damage from Hurricane Ian in 2022 due to its strategic design, including native landscaping, advanced stormwater systems, and reinforced homes. While some residents are moving to such planned communities, others with deep roots in coastal areas are rebuilding with government and nonprofit assistance to elevate their homes and install hurricane-proof features. These efforts underscore a growing recognition of the need to adapt to a future with more extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society (CBS) Arena, its home ground, from Frasers Group. The club's owner, Doug King, described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that safeguards the club's future and provides long-term stability after years of uncertainty regarding its venue. Owning the stadium allows the club to invest directly in facilities and the fan experience, ending a tumultuous period for supporters that involved multiple stadium owners and ground-shares. The announcement marks a new era of ambition for the Championship club, which can now fully control its revenue streams and future development.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger, social media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents, signaling a growing demand for generational change. These challengers argue that the party's aging establishment has become complacent and out-of-touch, failing to act with sufficient urgency in the face of threats posed by the Trump administration. They contend the intraparty divide is not about ideology but about a willingness to fight for a new vision for the party. This movement reflects a broader frustration and a belief that the leaders who have overseen the party's declining popularity cannot be the ones to reverse it.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne was a student at the brutal state-run reform school in the 1960s and later dropped out of high school to support his family. He fulfilled his lifelong goal through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. After completing the program's requirements, Horne participated in a graduation ceremony, expressing his happiness and hope that his story inspires others to overcome obstacles.</p>

          <p>According to a recent survey, Americans believe the ideal retirement age is 58, which is substantially earlier than the current average retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors warn that such an early exit from the workforce requires significant savings to fund a retirement that could last 30 to 40 years, including the crucial gap in health care coverage before Medicare eligibility begins at 65. The article notes that many people retire earlier than planned not because they are financially prepared, but due to unforeseen circumstances like health problems or employment issues.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While standard sunscreen protects against UV radiation, it often fails to block visible light, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, especially in people with darker skin. Dermatologists explain that tinted sunscreens, which contain pigments like iron oxide, offer superior protection against visible light damage. This is crucial for preventing and managing dark spots that can arise from skin inflammation, such as acne. As research on the effects of visible light evolves, experts are recommending tinted products as a more comprehensive solution for skin health, though they note the need for a wider range of shades to match diverse skin tones.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed erupting at its summit, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air. The eruption, which began Friday morning, is currently contained within the Halemaumau crater and poses no threat to homes. This activity marks the 31st display of molten rock since December, part of an ongoing eruption pattern. The U.S. Geological Survey is monitoring the volcano, and visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park are able to witness the spectacular natural event, which is also being live-streamed online.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged legal battle, a central street in Berlin has been officially renamed to honor Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to receive a doctorate from a European university in the 18th century. The street was formerly known as "Mohrenstraße," or "Moor Street," a term with deeply racist and colonial connotations. Civil society groups have campaigned for decades for the change, which was approved by the district council in 2020 but delayed by a lawsuit from residents. The final court ruling allowed the renaming to proceed, marking a significant moment in the city's efforts to decolonize its public spaces.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the 27th season of "South Park" has succeeded where other comedies have failed in effectively satirizing the second Trump administration. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have revived their anti-Trump commentary with gratifyingly mean and specific caricatures of political figures, avoiding the pitfalls of generic or self-righteous humor. By using its own established satirical language, such as depicting Trump with the same animation style as Saddam Hussein, the show makes pointed comparisons without moralizing. This approach allows the series to generate genuine laughs while critiquing the outsized and often bleak reality of current politics.</p>
