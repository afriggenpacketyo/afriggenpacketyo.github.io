          <p>President Trump concluded his three-nation Middle East tour, marked by opulent receptions and significant business deals with Gulf states. A notable development was Trump's engagement with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy. The trip also saw announcements of multibillion-dollar agreements for U.S. companies, although details remained sparse. Trump also addressed nuclear negotiations with Iran, suggesting a willingness to abandon maximalist positions, and made an unusual reference to the suffering in Gaza, signaling a potential shift in his approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced declines, overall full-year sales rose by 4%. The company remains cautious about ongoing global uncertainties, including gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but believes its pricing power will help offset these challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that college majors in nutrition, art history, and philosophy are currently outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects for recent graduates. While STEM fields are typically touted as a path to high-paying jobs, computer science and engineering graduates are experiencing higher unemployment rates than the national average. This shift is partly attributed to the rising demand for creative thinking and soft skills in the age of artificial intelligence, with some companies adjusting their hiring strategies to prioritize humanities majors.</p>

          <p>With economic uncertainty affecting seniors and retirees, annuities can provide guaranteed monthly payouts in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A $50,000 annuity's monthly payments vary based on age, gender, and contract structure, but can supplement Social Security and other income. Depending on factors such as age, an annuity could yield from about $285 to $425 a month. This can help alleviate financial anxieties and provide a buffer against longevity risk, though it lacks the flexibility of other investments. (not investment advice)</p>
