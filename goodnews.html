          <p>President Trump removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him to be the ambassador to the United Nations. Trump thanked Waltz for his service and stated that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would temporarily fill the role. Sources suggest Waltz was ousted due to a Signal app controversy and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff, but Trump offered him the UN post as a 'soft landing'. The article also mentions Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, and the scrutiny faced by other Signal chat participants in congressional hearings.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with overall sales growth slowing due to factors including President Trump's trade policies and tariffs. The company's North American retail business experienced its slowest growth since the pandemic's peak. CEO Andy Jassy stated that Amazon is focused on keeping prices down by purchasing extra inventory in advance of tariffs and assisting sellers on its marketplace. Amazon's cloud computing business grew by 17%, but was limited by data center capacity.</p>
