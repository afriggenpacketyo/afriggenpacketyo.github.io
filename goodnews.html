          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist state assemblyman, in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant upset. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, was attempting a political comeback. In his concession speech, Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's victory and indicated he would consider his next steps. If elected, Mamdani would be the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of New York City, a city that is known as the nation's largest.</p>

He did not specifically address U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict during his address.

          <p>A controversial Republican plan to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states, including California, was removed from a tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. Senator Mike Lee's proposal aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule, which prevents extraneous budget provisions in reconciliation bills. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, though Senator Lee indicated he would continue to pursue the plan with revisions.</p>

          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary features a battle between left-wing outsider Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has gained support with a platform focused on affordability, including free public buses and universal childcare. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, emphasizes his experience and moderate stance. The race is seen as a proxy war between the left-wing and moderate factions of the Democratic Party, with implications for the party nationally as it tries to take on Trump, who has made inroads in the city.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park ensured that the bears "posed no threat to the public at any point", and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The bears were continuously monitored and successfully returned to their enclosure by keepers using recall training. An investigation is underway to determine how the animals escaped, with the park citing an "operational error."</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of stars nearing the end of their lives to look into the Milky Way‚Äôs past and find that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Researchers studied thousands of stars and found that as the Milky Way evolved, newly formed stars began spinning up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. That extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>China is expanding ways for foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar as international confidence in the greenback wanes. The People's Bank of China is planning to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promote yuan foreign exchange futures trading. These moves focus on the futures market and encourage global investors to use the yuan, though strict capital controls and geopolitical risks remain barriers. The world's second-largest economy has also been promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's Venice wedding party venue was moved from the city center to the Arsenale, an isolated part of the lagoon city, following protests. The wedding party, expected to cost between ‚Ç¨40 and ‚Ç¨48 million, drew criticism from residents and pressure groups who argued it would transform the city into a private amusement park for the rich. Protesters plan to rally against the wedding ceremony, while Bezos is expected to make sizable charity donations, including ‚Ç¨1 million for Corila, an academic consortium studying Venice's lagoon ecosystem.</p>
