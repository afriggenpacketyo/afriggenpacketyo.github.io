          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, influenced by gains on Wall Street. Investors are closely watching for China's upcoming decision on its loan prime rates, with analysts polled by Reuters anticipating that the rates will remain unchanged. This follows the central bank's recent move to hold a key interest rate steady. The positive momentum in Asia reflects a strong week for U.S. markets, where the Dow Jones and S&P 500 reached new all-time highs following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut.

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Denver Broncos 23-20, completing an early-season sweep of their AFC West rivals and achieving a 3-0 start for the first time since 2002. Quarterback Justin Herbert led a late-game comeback, connecting with Keenan Allen for a tying touchdown before setting up the game-winning 43-yard field goal by Cameron Dicker as time expired. The victory was hard-fought, as the Chargers had to overcome a 17-0 scoring run by the Broncos in the second half. The win was tempered by a potentially serious Achilles tendon injury to running back Najee Harris.</p>

          <p>The UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, Pat McFadden, has affirmed the government's commitment to reforming the welfare system to address rising costs and better support people returning to work. This comes after the government abandoned a controversial policy that would have cut nearly £5 billion from disability and health-related benefits. McFadden stated that reform "must happen" and did not rule out future changes to eligibility for benefits like universal credit. The government plans to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits, aiming to overhaul a costly system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the illness. The project, centered on Nantucket island, aims to make the mice immune to the Lyme-causing bacteria, thereby breaking the infection cycle where ticks feed on mice and then transmit the disease to humans. Led by MIT associate professor Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" initiative uses CRISPR technology to create a heritable immunity that can be passed down through generations. The team is engaging in extensive community outreach to ensure public buy-in before any potential release of the engineered animals.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing open inquiry and ideological diversity. Founded by figures like historian Niall Ferguson and journalist Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat what it sees as a culture of self-censorship and political imbalance on other campuses. UATX offers free tuition for its initial classes, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations, and emphasizes a curriculum based on Western civilization. The startup university operates with a bare-bones campus to focus on its academic mission.</p>

          <p>Each year, a unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes a mysterious and remarkable 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. These butterflies live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs by suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the arduous journey. Scientists are studying this phenomenon as the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants. Conservation efforts, such as creating "Monarch Waystations," are underway to help preserve this incredible natural spectacle.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their regular-season home finale to the San Francisco Giants 3-1, as the bullpen was unable to hold a late lead. Rookie pitcher Emmet Sheehan delivered an impressive performance, allowing only one hit and striking out ten over seven scoreless innings. However, the Giants scored three runs in the eighth inning off reliever Blake Treinen to secure the win. Despite the loss, the Dodgers celebrated a franchise-record home attendance of over four million fans for the season and remain poised to clinch the NL West division title.</p>

Trump described the potential investors as "American patriots" and stated that progress is being made on a deal between the U.S. and China.

Later, in the ninth, he made a leaping grab at the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung indicated that his government would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim step. In an interview, Lee described such a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the immediate, complete denuclearization that has been the long-term goal of past negotiations. He noted that with North Korea producing 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually, halting development would be a clear benefit while keeping the ultimate goal of denuclearization on the table.

While the government touts the expansion as a "no-brainer for growth," the project faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups.
