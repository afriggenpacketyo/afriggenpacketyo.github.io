          <p>A history enthusiast using a metal detector has led archaeologists to the location of a medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, thanks to a peculiar symbol identified on an old map. G√∂ran Bengtsson, the hobbyist, noticed a strange rectangle on 18th-century maps, labeled as "Klosterkullen" or "monastery hill" on a 1760 map, and archaeologists confirmed the site using ground-penetrating radar, revealing walls of probable monastery ruins. The discovery, dating back to the late 1100s, is believed to be the original site of √Ös Abbey, a large monastery managed by the Cistercian religious order, and the walls uncovered are roughly 6.5 feet thick, believed to be remains of pillar foundations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study across 30 European countries indicates that while parenthood provides a greater sense of meaning in life, it often leads to lower life satisfaction, particularly for mothers. Sociologists Marita Jacob and Ansgar Hudde found that parents, regardless of nationality or social status, reported feeling their lives were more fulfilled compared to childfree individuals. However, the level of life satisfaction depended significantly on factors such as living situations and family policies within their respective countries, with Scandinavian nations showing less disparity between parents and non-parents. The study also highlights that greater gender equality and societal support for families contribute to higher parental satisfaction levels.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, has expressed support for the new Olympic age limit that restricts competition to athletes 14 and older, despite the potential impact on its medal prospects, and the decision by governing body World Skate would have excluded some of Japan's past Olympic medalists. The move is seen as a positive step to mitigate the risk of severe injuries among younger athletes, and Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction. Despite the new international age limits, domestic competitions in Japan will remain open to younger participants, reflecting a continued focus on nurturing young talent.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to its Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first changes to punishment forms in over a century, and imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work is not mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law includes tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, such as programs for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues, and the shift aims to reduce recidivism and provide more individualized treatment for prisoners.</p>
