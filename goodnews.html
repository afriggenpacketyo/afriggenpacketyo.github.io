          <p>The UN Security Council has authorized a significantly larger multinational force for Haiti, transforming the current Kenya-led mission into a "Gang Suppression Force" with up to 5,500 personnel. This move aims to curb escalating gang violence that has paralyzed the economy and threatened the nation's future. The resolution, co-sponsored by the U.S. and Panama, was welcomed by Haiti's transitional presidential council as a decisive turning point. This international effort seeks to restore stability and protect the terrorized Haitian population.</p>

The "rare attack" occurred about 12 miles off Catalina, resulting in non-life-threatening injuries to the swimmer's leg and foot. Authorities reported the man was awake and talking, suffering only mild distress, and was transported to a non-trauma facility.

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its robotics sector, installing nearly 300,000 new robots last year, exceeding the rest of the world combined. This article argues that China's focus on embodied intelligence, or AI-powered robots, is a deliberate strategy to achieve independence in core AI technologies. The country's cohesive, long-term policy framework, including initiatives like Made in China 2025, promotes robotics adoption across various sectors, creating massive domestic demand for advanced AI chips. Huawei's open-sourcing of its AI computing toolkit further underscores this drive for self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for workers on residential construction projects to over $32 an hour, plus an additional $7.65 per hour for healthcare. This initiative aims to attract workers to an industry facing labor shortages, exacerbated by fears of immigration raids and the need to rebuild units lost in the Palisades fire. Backed by construction unions and housing groups, the motion seeks to protect non-union, often foreign-born, workers vulnerable to wage theft. This article highlights a local effort to address labor market challenges and worker exploitation.</p>

          <p>Nike reported a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding expectations, but its profits fell 31%, and gross margin dropped. Finance chief Matt Friend warned that progress "will not be linear," indicating that efforts to clear old inventory are still impacting profitability. The article highlights strengths in wholesale, running, and North America sales, while direct sales and revenue in China declined. CEO Elliott Hill is focused on reigniting innovation and realigning corporate structure, though these strategies come with short-term financial pain. (not investment advice)</p>
