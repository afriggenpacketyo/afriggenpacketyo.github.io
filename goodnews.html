        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to relocate thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to regional offices across the country, aiming to save ¬£94 million annually by 2032. The initiative includes cutting 12,000 roles in London and closing 11 offices, while opening new government campuses in Manchester and Aberdeen. This move intends to bring decision-making closer to communities and create a civil service that reflects the diversity of the UK. Government departments are tasked with submitting relocation plans, with 50% of senior civil servants expected to be based in regional offices by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days while negotiating economic and trade policy, signaling a potential shift in their trade relationship. This follows a period of heightened tensions and reciprocal tariffs that impacted businesses and global markets. While the tariff reductions offer a temporary reprieve, businesses are advised to mitigate tariff uncertainty by diversifying supply chains. China continues to emphasize self-sufficiency and is expanding trade relationships with other regions, even as the U.S. urges an end to unfair trade practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's second-highest court ruled that the European Commission should not have denied a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between its president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Pfizer's CEO during negotiations for COVID-19 vaccine access. The court stated that the commission failed to provide credible explanations for not retaining or disclosing the messages, raising questions about transparency and accountability in EU policy-making. The case, brought by The New York Times, centers on whether these messages are considered official documents under EU law. The commission can appeal the verdict, but the ruling could set a legal precedent regarding transparency within the European Union.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the removal of all U.S. sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness and stability. Trump highlighted the new Syrian government led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda member, expressing hope for peace and progress. The decision marks a significant shift after decades of sanctions imposed due to Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism and its brutal crackdown on anti-government uprisings. Aid organizations have long advocated for sanctions relief to facilitate humanitarian assistance and economic recovery in the war-torn country.</p>

          <p>Japan will allow over-the-counter drugs to be sold at convenience stores within two years following the enactment of revised laws in parliament. Currently, these drugs are restricted to sales by pharmacists or registered sellers. The new legislation requires buyers to receive online usage guidance from pharmacists at designated convenience stores. To address concerns about drug abuse, sales of high-risk medicines, like cough and cold remedies, will be limited to one small package per person for young people. Measures to prevent overdosing and other forms of drug abuse will be enforced within a year.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post discussing passengers vaping in airplane bathrooms has sparked a debate about on-board behavior and detection methods. Users claiming to be flight attendants stated that sensors throughout the plane can detect smoke or particulates, triggering alarms in the cockpit. Travel expert Gary Leff confirmed that modern smoke detectors can detect aerosols from vaping, and the FAA prohibits vaping on planes, extending the ban on cigarettes to include e-cigarettes. Some passengers reported witnessing vaping in seats without intervention, while others emphasized the risk of arrest for violating the policy.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which provide personalized wealth management services for the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth but struggling to find qualified money managers. The demand for these services is increasing as the number of family offices is expected to rise significantly by 2030. However, family offices face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent, and they often prioritize trust over other qualifications when hiring. The talent crunch is also attributed to the lack of clear corporate structures and the perception of family offices as "retirement jobs."</p>
