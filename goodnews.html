          <p>Retail investors invested over $24 million in Berkshire Hathaway's Class B stock, demonstrating confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel despite Warren Buffett's announcement to step down as CEO at year-end. The stock experienced a 5% decline following Buffett's announcement, yet the net inflows into the stock surged, indicating strong investor belief in the company's future under Abel's leadership. Buffett, who plans to remain as chairman, praised Abel and assured shareholders he would not sell his shares, reinforcing stability. This investor behavior shows a continuing faith in Berkshire's prospects, even with the change in leadership. (not investment advice)</p>
