          <p>Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge on eggs that it implemented in response to record-high prices caused by an avian flu outbreak. The move signals a normalization of egg prices, which had soared over the past year, impacting consumers and businesses alike. While wholesale prices have fallen, retail egg prices in May were still significantly higher than the previous year, reflecting broader, albeit slowing, food inflation. The popular diner chain is a major consumer of eggs, serving hundreds of millions annually.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates near record highs, many consumers are considering debt forgiveness programs as a potential solution for overwhelming balances. These programs can potentially reduce debt by 30% to 50% for those with significant balances and a demonstrated financial hardship. However, forgiveness is not a universal solution, as it can negatively impact credit scores and may not be suitable for those who can manage repayment through other means. Experts advise carefully weighing this option against alternatives like debt consolidation or credit counseling before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Portugal recently witnessed a rare and dramatic weather phenomenon known as a roll cloud, which appeared like a massive tsunami wave in the sky. This low-hanging, tube-shaped cloud formed following a period of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 107¬∞F, that gave way to thunderstorms. According to the National Weather Service, these arcus clouds are relatively uncommon and appear to be rolling on a horizontal axis, often associated with thunderstorm activity. The striking visuals prompted many onlookers to share videos and photos of the event on social media.</p>

          <p>For consumers struggling with high-interest credit card debt, consolidation can be an effective strategy, but it requires careful preparation. Before pursuing consolidation, individuals should first calculate their total debt, including all interest rates and fees, to understand the full financial picture. The next step is to thoroughly research and compare all available options, such as personal loans and balance transfer cards, from various lenders like banks and credit unions. Finally, considering a structured debt consolidation program through a reputable relief company might be a beneficial alternative for some borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" or "someone who's too social" can reveal the real, day-to-day culture, helping candidates determine if the environment is the right fit for their personal values.</p>
