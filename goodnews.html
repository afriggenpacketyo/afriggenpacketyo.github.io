          <p>China's industrial profits saw a rise of 3% in April, marking a second consecutive month of growth despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. This cumulative profit increase follows a return to growth in the first quarter, reversing previous declines. While U.S. tariffs reached as high as 145% before a recent trade truce, China's manufacturing activity experienced a contraction. Exports to the U.S. significantly decreased due to these tariffs, but overall exports grew due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the high prices paid for teams. The legislation would affect future owners, limiting their ability to deduct the full value of intangible assets like player contracts and media rights over 15 years. While the White House claims the measure aims to ensure fairness for fans, some team owners view it as punitive, especially given President Trump's past conflicts with leagues like the NFL. The proposed tax change could raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years and might influence the timing of team sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was released from the hospital after being treated for an inflammation of the inner ear, which caused him to experience vertigo. The 79-year-old president underwent imaging and blood tests, all of which came back normal, and is now resting at the presidential residence. Lula has a history of medical issues, including high blood pressure, throat cancer, and a previous fall that led to a brain bleed, but is expected to run for reelection next year.</p>

          <h2>Apprenticeship Program Changes Prioritize Under-21s</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 19:50:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding, focusing primarily on individuals under 21 years of age in England. Only students under the age of 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree. While promising more training opportunities for young adults, the government is pulling funding from postgraduate apprenticeships, a move that has drawn criticism. The changes aim to shift more money towards entry-level apprenticeships, and will also involve an increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK to create 45,000 training places.</p>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada is being interpreted as a subtle assertion of Canadian sovereignty amid President Trump's past suggestions of annexation. Invited by Prime Minister Mark Carney, the King's presence emphasizes Canada's distinct heritage and its ties to Britain. While Canada's head of state is officially the British monarch, the trip is largely symbolic, with the King set to open Canada‚Äôs Parliament and deliver a speech highlighting the government's legislative plans. The visit reflects Canada's long history of maintaining its independence from the United States.</p>
