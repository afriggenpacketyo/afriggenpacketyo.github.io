          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is investing ¬£50 million to expand the use of its app for communicating with patients, aiming to save ¬£200 million over the next three years. Millions more patients will receive test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly on their smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. The department says 270 million messages will be sent through the NHS app this financial year, an increase of 70 million on the previous year. The changes are intended to provide patients with better access to manage their healthcare and make informed decisions, with services now used in 87% of hospitals across England.</p>

          <p>Cancer death rates in the US have significantly declined since 1991, largely due to advancements in treatment, screening, and prevention efforts. The age-adjusted death rate has decreased by about a third, resulting in over 4 million fewer cancer deaths. This progress is attributed to factors such as the decline in smoking, the HPV vaccine, improved screening methods, and breakthroughs in treatments like autologous stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy. While challenges remain, particularly with rising rates of gastrointestinal cancers among younger people, the overall trend indicates significant progress in the fight against cancer.</p>

          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims about wind energy that have been amplified on social media. These claims include the assertions that windmills are driving whales crazy, that they kill droves of birds, that wind turbines aren't properly recycled, and that they provide inconsistent energy efficiency. The article presents evidence and data to counter these claims, highlighting the relatively small impact of wind turbines on bird mortality compared to other factors and the ongoing efforts to improve turbine recycling and efficiency.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Belmont Stakes will feature a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, with Journalism as the morning-line favorite. Sovereignty, who won the Derby, skipped the Preakness to prepare for the Belmont, which will be held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park. The article provides a list of all the horses racing in the Belmont, along with their morning-line odds and background information on their trainers and jockeys.

          <p>The article explores the concept of federal rental aid with time limits, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year maximum. The program includes work requirements and helps people save money through interest-bearing savings accounts. While some argue that time limits encourage upward mobility, others worry about the consequences for those who struggle to find affordable housing. The article also examines a similar program in Washington state that was ultimately discontinued due to its negative impact on tenants.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa's tenure as the Doctor on 'Doctor Who' represented a departure from the show's previous direction, emphasizing queerness and emotional availability. Gatwa was the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the role, bringing a new perspective to the series. While the show's embrace of fantasy elements has been debated, Gatwa's Doctor confronted issues of racism and brought a sense of emotional depth to the character, creating a lasting contribution to the legacy of Doctor Who.</p>
