          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to claim his fourth Tour de France championship after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his overall lead. While Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever stage win with a bold solo attack, Pogačar finished securely within the main peloton. The final stage is traditionally a non-competitive, processional ride into Paris, meaning his victory is virtually assured barring any last-minute accidents, solidifying another dominant performance.</p>

In a major upset, Lewis Hamilton was eliminated early in the qualifying session after his lap time was deleted for exceeding track limits, forcing him to start from 16th on the grid.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has made a significant return to the music charts with his new album, "Swag," and its No. 2 hit single, "Daisies."
