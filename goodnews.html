          <p>Australian all-rounder Beau Webster reflects on his journey to securing a spot in the national team, which includes considering life after cricket and dabbling in various fields such as building, journalism, business, and mortgage broking. Webster's role as a seamer came about during the Covid pandemic when Tasmania needed a seam-bowling all-rounder, with the help of pace-bowling coach Adam Griffith. Initially seen as a gimmick due to his history as an off-spin bowler, Webster gained credibility after consistent performance and support from teammates like Usman Khawaja.</p>
