          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of Christopher Pelkey, a victim of a 2021 road rage incident, during the sentencing of his killer. The AI avatar delivered a message of forgiveness, which the judge praised, but the use of AI in legal proceedings has ignited debate about potential manipulation and emotional compounding. Legal experts are divided, with some raising concerns about the slippery slope of altered evidence and others seeing no ethical issue in its use during sentencing without a jury. The video opened with a disclaimer clarifying that it was an AI recreation using the victim's picture and voice profile.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's nomination of Dr. Casey Means as Surgeon General has drawn criticism due to her background in functional medicine and lack of a current medical license. Critics, including Laura Loomer and Nicole Shanahan, question her qualifications and wellness practices, while supporters like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defend her ability to inspire Americans to rethink healthcare. The debate centers on whether a non-practicing physician with a focus on holistic therapies is suitable for the role, which oversees public health initiatives and requires specialized training or experience in public health programs.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being removed as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire, sustained damage during its helicopter transport. The top portion of the tower made contact with power lines, though no injuries were reported. The tower was one of two being removed for testing to determine the cause of the fire. Edison International CEO Pedro Pizarro suggested induction as a leading theory, involving the re-energization of an idle tower and power lines.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the UK, but details reveal limited substantive benefits for the US, while the UK still faces higher tariffs than before. The deal involves the US rolling back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel in exchange for expanded opportunities for American beef, ethanol, and agricultural products in the UK. While some in the UK express relief, analysts note that the deal provides Trump with a political victory without significant changes. The announcement drew criticism from American carmakers who pointed out the reduced tariffs would make UK-made cars less expensive than many of their models made in Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain that will increase market access for American farm exports, hailing it as a "tremendous" deal. In return, the US will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. While a 10% baseline tariff remains, the deal expands market access for American products and reduces non-tariff barriers. The agreement sets the tone for other trading partners to promote reciprocal trade with the United States.</p>

          <p>India is considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a shift from its protectionist stance. While the U.S. deal could boost trade, concerns remain about its impact on India's domestic manufacturing ambitions. Experts suggest that even with zero tariffs, some sectors may not be significantly affected due to factors like transportation costs and market dynamics. Potential winners from the deal include financial, materials, healthcare, and logistics companies, while losers could be those that fail to reach an agreement.</p>

A Special Congress has been called to vote on the issue, after the Kilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before a match. A Gaelic Players Association survey found that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to choose shorts. While some argue it's a minor issue compared to larger challenges in women's sports, many players feel it's a matter of comfort and player welfare.</p>
