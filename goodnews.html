          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during the government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which will disrupt customer service functions. Key services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards will be halted. Additionally, the shutdown could delay the release of inflation data needed to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), potentially impacting the announcement of next year's benefit increase.</p>

          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced a major deal to deploy 50,000 of AMD's Instinct MI450 AI chips, signaling a significant move to diversify the AI hardware market currently dominated by Nvidia. The deployment, set to begin in the second half of 2026, reflects a growing trend among cloud providers to offer alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs for artificial intelligence tasks, particularly for AI inferencing. This partnership follows recent deals between OpenAI, AMD, and Oracle, underscoring OpenAI's strategy to secure vast computing power from multiple suppliers to support its advanced AI development, thereby intensifying competition in the high-stakes AI chip sector.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion judgment against him for defaming the families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones had falsely and repeatedly claimed the mass shooting was a hoax. His attorneys had argued the massive sum amounted to a "financial death penalty" that could never be paid. The court's denial, issued without comment, effectively ends Jones's legal challenges to the damages awarded by a Connecticut jury and judge, solidifying a major victory for the families who sued him for his harmful disinformation.</p>

Following a decisive 3-0 victory over Eswatini, the country, known as the "Blue Sharks," secured its spot in the 2026 tournament. As the smallest African country by population to ever qualify, the accomplishment sparked widespread celebrations with fireworks and music in the streets of the capital, Praia. This milestone is seen as a monumental victory for the Cape Verdean people and is expected to inspire a new generation of soccer fans and players across the archipelago.</p>

          <p>The explosive growth of artificial intelligence is creating a new and valuable asset class in commercial real estate known as "powered land." This refers to land that has been pre-approved and equipped with the necessary permits and infrastructure to deliver the massive amounts of electricity required by modern data centers. With the challenge shifting from construction to securing power, real estate investment firms like Hines are now focusing on acquiring these AI-ready sites. This emerging market is attracting significant capital from tech-focused private equity firms, reshaping development strategies and expanding data center hubs into new, power-rich regions.</p>

          <h2>Instagram Implements PG-13 Style Content Restrictions for Teenage Users</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta is rolling out new content restrictions for teenage users on Instagram, designed to create a safer, more age-appropriate experience by default. The new settings will automatically filter content to a level comparable to a PG-13 movie rating for all users under 18. This will block search results for sensitive terms like "gore" and prevent teens from following or interacting with accounts that frequently post age-inappropriate material. The platform is also introducing a more restrictive "Limited Content" setting for parents who want to further curtail their teen's exposure to potentially harmful content and interactions.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is hosting a three-day international conference focused on planning the reconstruction of Gaza, signaling its intent to play a key role in the post-conflict peace process. The event brings together representatives from business, civil society, and governments, including Germany, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Authority, to coordinate efforts for rebuilding the war-torn territory. While the U.S. and Israel are not in attendance, the conference aims to align with a Palestinian-led recovery and an Arab Reconstruction Plan. Experts view such gatherings as a crucial first step, though they emphasize the need for UN oversight and Israeli involvement for long-term success.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter financial results, with every business division posting record revenue. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 34% surge in banking revenues and a 7% increase in its services business, which had its best quarter ever. CEO Jane Fraser attributed the strong performance to the company's strategic execution and investments in new products, digital assets, and AI. The positive earnings report caused a slight rise in the company's stock price, which has already outperformed the S&P 500 this year with a gain of over 37%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall from recent highs, housing experts anticipate a mixed impact on the U.S. real estate market. While lower rates increase affordability and may entice buyers who were waiting on the sidelines, this surge in demand is likely to intensify competition for a still-limited housing inventory. This increased competition could, in turn, drive home prices higher, potentially offsetting the savings from a lower interest rate. Lenders are also seeing a spike in both new purchase and refinance applications, which could lead to slower processing times and delays in closing for prospective homebuyers.

          <p>Retired England bowler Stuart Broad has stoked the rivalry ahead of this winter's Ashes series, claiming that Australia's current team is their "worst since 2010." That year marked England's last series victory down under. Broad argues that while Australia remains the favorite at home, they face question marks over their lineup and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. He contrasted this with what he calls the "best English team since 2010," suggesting the matchup could lead to a highly competitive series. The comments add a layer of psychological pressure on an Australian side already dealing with injury concerns.</p>

          <p>As part of a major turnaround plan for the Jeep brand, parent company Stellantis is overhauling its high-end Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year. The changes include killing the confusing standalone "Wagoneer" nameplate, simplifying the trim levels, and lowering the starting price to under $65,000 to better compete in the market. A new extended-range electric powertrain will also be introduced, aiming to make the Grand Wagoneer a leader in its class. These adjustments are a direct response to disappointing sales and dealer feedback since the vehicle's 2021 launch, reflecting a broader strategy to boost Jeep's declining market share.</p>

Speaking to the Israeli parliament, he hailed the moment as the start of a "grand concord of lasting harmony." The exchange is the first step in a 20-point peace plan brokered by his administration.

          <p>According to new projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Kingdom's economy is forecast to grow by 1.3% in 2025, making it the second-fastest-growing economy among the G7 advanced nations, trailing only the United States. The outlook was upgraded due to strong activity in the first half of the year and an improved trade outlook. However, the report also predicts that UK inflation will be the highest in the G7 for 2025 and 2026, driven by rising energy costs, though the IMF expects this to be temporary.
