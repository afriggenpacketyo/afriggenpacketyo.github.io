          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, but insists it would not reinstate pre-Brexit freedom of movement. The proposed scheme would allow young people to move abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. Critics like Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch have expressed concerns that the scheme could lead to "free movement through the back door." An agreement is expected to be announced at a summit between the UK and the EU, although details regarding eligibility and caps on numbers are still being negotiated.</p>

          <p>Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan performed together at the Hollywood Bowl as part of the annual Outlaw Music Festival, marking their second appearance together in less than a year. Nelson, at 92, donned a stylish black puffer jacket to combat the chilly weather, while Dylan, soon to be 84, delivered reinvented versions of his classic hits. The concert featured highlights such as Nelson's spectral country-jazz renditions of "Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground" and "Always on My Mind," as well as Dylan's rockabilly take on "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right." The Outlaw tour also includes performances from Billy Strings and Sierra Hull.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Walmart after the retailer cautioned that it would need to raise prices due to tariffs. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" rather than pass the costs onto consumers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had previously noted the unprecedented speed and magnitude of recent price increases. Walmart has stated that it will strive to maintain low prices despite the challenges posed by tariffs, absorbing some costs and working with suppliers to mitigate the impact on shoppers.

          <p>The UK is reportedly close to securing a deal with the EU that would allow British passport holders to use e-gates across Europe, potentially reducing airport queueing times for travelers. Officials are discussing the agreement ahead of the UK-EU summit in London, which will primarily focus on security and defense. The deal could eliminate the need for passport stamping, further streamlining the entry process. In addition, discussions are underway regarding mobility for musicians, youth mobility, and veterinary agreements to reduce trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth." The creature, about the length of an index finger, possessed a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. Researchers found that Mosura was more complex than previously understood, featuring a segmented body with gills similar to modern arthropods. The well-preserved fossil also revealed the creature's open circulatory system.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has chided the Trump administration for its aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The justices criticized the administration's attempt to provide only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. The ruling underscores the legal principle that immigrants should have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when the administration claims extraordinary powers to remove them. Legal scholars have hailed the court's support for due process while expressing concern that such support was even necessary.</p>
