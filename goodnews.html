          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, who is sitting out the WNBA All-Star Game due to a groin injury, will still participate as a team captain and assistant coach. Speaking ahead of the game, she humorously stated her goal is to heckle the referees from the bench, possibly earning a technical foul while otherwise enjoying the event. Clark, who received the most fan votes, is known for her passionate interactions with officials during games, a trait common among many WNBA players. Her injury occurred during a recent game against the Connecticut Sun.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team secured a decisive 40-5 victory over the United States in a Test match in Washington D.C. that was significantly delayed by weather. The game experienced a one-hour delay at kickoff and another 40-minute pause in the first half due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, completing their summer tour with a perfect record. The USA managed a late try to avoid a shutout, and the event also saw several players make their England debut.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense aimed at individuals preparing for mass casualty attacks, even if they lack a specific terrorist ideology. This move comes in response to the Southport attack, where the perpetrator had planned the violence but could not be charged with a serious preparatory offense beforehand due to the absence of an ideological motive. The proposed law would mirror existing counter-terrorism legislation, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory actions like researching targets, thereby closing a perceived gap in the legal system.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry professionally handled a technical issue during her San Francisco concert when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped a few feet. The incident occurred mid-song while she was suspended over the audience, but Perry quickly recomposed herself and continued her performance without interruption. The event highlights the potential risks of complex stage mechanics used in modern concerts. Perry's "The Lifetimes Tour" is known for its elaborate props that suspend her in the air, similar to systems used by other major artists.</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges in UK Over Shortening Traditional Six-Week School Summer Holidays</h2>

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week summer school holiday and redistributing the time off throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help mitigate learning loss, ease childcare and cost-of-living burdens on parents, and potentially lower holiday prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, viewing the long break as essential for recharging and planning. While some schools have already moved to a five-week summer, broader proposals in places like Wales have been paused after facing divisive public and professional responses.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signaled a push to encourage savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments. The government believes that overly negative risk warnings have deterred people from the potential benefits of investing, and it plans new ad campaigns and targeted messages to promote it. This initiative includes a debate on potentially reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize a shift to investment ISAs, though critics warn this could backfire and put off a generation of new investors.

          <p>Germany is strengthening its security and political ties with France and the United Kingdom, forming a cooperative group known as the "E3." This pivot towards European partners is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitment to NATO under President Trump. A new bilateral treaty between Germany and the UK provides for close security and arms cooperation. This strategic realignment emphasizes Europe's need for greater defense independence, with the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK seen as a potential supplement to the U.S. security guarantee.</p>
