          <p>Following the conclusion of the Glastonbury Festival, a massive cleanup operation has begun at Worthy Farm. Thousands of attendees are departing, causing significant traffic delays, while volunteers tackle the task of clearing discarded items like tents, chairs, and rubbish. Organizers urged festival-goers to leave the site tidy and to take precautions against the expected high temperatures during their travel. The site will now be prepared for a fallow year in 2026, allowing the land to recover from the large-scale event.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new law banning smoking in public areas frequented by children, including parks, beaches, and swimming pools. The ban also extends to areas near schools and libraries, with violators facing significant fines. Health Minister Catherine Vautrin stated the goal is to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032, citing the 75,000 annual smoking-related deaths in the country. While the measure has majority public support, some smokers view it as an excessive restriction on personal freedom in a country known for its caf√© culture.</p>

          <p>Trade talks between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government canceled its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "direct and blatant attack." The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to companies like Google and Meta, costing them an estimated $2 billion. While the resumption of talks is a step forward, some analysts note that the retreat makes Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney appear vulnerable to U.S. pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

To compete with AI chatbots, Reddit has also launched its own "Reddit Answers" AI tool, which generates responses based solely on user discussions.

          <p>When a friend is diagnosed with cancer, providing meaningful support can be challenging, but experts and survivors offer key advice. They emphasize the importance of simply reaching out, as "cancer ghosting" can be more painful than the treatment itself. Instead of talking, it is better to ask open-ended questions and listen without offering unsolicited advice, comparisons, or platitudes like "you'll beat this." Offering specific, practical help, such as dropping off a particular meal on a specific day, is more effective than a vague "let me know if you need anything."</p>

          <p>The number of murders across the United States is falling significantly, with a drop of at least 14% in 2024 and further declines expected. While policing tactics play a role, crime analysts point to a broader primary driver: the end of the COVID-19 pandemic's societal disruptions. Researchers suggest that the restoration of public services, community programs, and in-person schooling has re-engaged young people and rebuilt vital support systems. This return to normalcy is believed to be interrupting cycles of violence that surged when these structures were shut down.</p>

          <p>In a story from the "My Unsung Hero" series, Karen de Boer recounts a pivotal moment from her freshman year of college in 1990. After oversleeping and missing the bus for a crucial choir performance, she was distraught. Her hallmate Pam, with whom she had a rocky relationship due to de Boer's noisy behavior, offered to drive her an hour to the church. This unexpected act of kindness and forgiveness not only saved her from missing the performance but also left a lasting impression on de Boer, teaching her a profound lesson about grace.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests India's Booming Real Estate Market Is Not a Substitute for China's</h2>

          <p>Despite a significant boom in India's property sector, it cannot be seen as a replacement for China's market, which plays a more substantial role in Asia and is supported by different fundamentals. While China's housing crisis deepens, with falling prices and investment, India's market is surging. However, the article argues that the two markets are not interchangeable due to vast differences in scale, maturity, and structure. China's commercial property sentiment is the most downbeat in the Asia-Pacific, a stark contrast to the optimism seen in India's burgeoning real estate landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's same-sex partnership system, first introduced in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward in 2015, is now available to 92.5 percent of the country's population, according to a new survey. A total of 530 local governments have implemented the system, which grants registered couples access to some public services like housing. Despite this widespread adoption at the local level, Japan remains the only G7 nation that has not legalized same-sex marriage. The partnership certificates are not legally valid, denying couples key rights such as inheritance and co-parenting.</p>

The couple, both of whom missed the 2023 World Cup with ACL injuries, maintain a professional and competitive approach to the match-up, limiting football talk as the game approaches. Mead and Miedema, who have been together since 2022, share a dog that has become an unofficial mascot for the England team during preparations.</p>
