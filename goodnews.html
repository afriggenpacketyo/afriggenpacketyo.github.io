          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress that lawmakers would be involved in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance, addressing concerns about the pact's future following reports of a Pentagon review. Hegseth's statement came in response to questions from US congressman Joe Courtney, who expressed worries about the review's timeframe, given the years of development behind the security pact between Australia, Britain, and the US. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated China's opposition to actions that amplify nuclear proliferation risks and exacerbate the arms race, highlighting the alliance's objective to counter China's regional influence.</p>

          <p>Kweichow Moutai, China's prominent liquor distiller, is responding to Beijing's renewed emphasis on austerity by distancing itself from lavish lifestyles. Management has committed to thrift guidelines, removing the expensive baijiu liquor from government banquets, which has narrowed the firm's profit margin. Moutai chairman Zhang Deqin referenced classic Chinese texts, emphasizing the liquor's role in promoting culture, health, and harmony. Moutai's strong liquor has been a preferred drink for Chinese officials since the early years of the Communist Party, often given as official gifts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his support for Chinese students studying in the United States, pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. Trump stated that he has always been strongly in favor of Chinese nationals seeking to study in the US, believing it benefits both the students and the country. This stance contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump added that he supports allowing these graduates to be hired by American companies, recognizing their potential contributions to the US economy.</p>

          <p>Amid a US-China trade truce, negotiators in London reached a "framework" agreement to activate the Geneva deal, raising hopes for an immediate alleviation of the trade conflict. The agreement may include a US commitment to revoke some tech embargoes in return for China's relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. China's unprecedented tightening of its rare earth exports, impacting US car manufacturers and defense companies, was a key factor prompting Trump to engage with Xi. The London talks may have de-escalated tensions, but significant reorientation of Washington‚Äôs trade and foreign policy thinking is needed for lasting optimism.</p>

          <p>The Senate is signaling changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with senators discussing proposed alterations to the House-approved package. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the bill aims to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path. Key areas of focus include SNAP, SALT deductions, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Changes to SNAP could lessen the burden on states, while the Senate plans to lower the cap on state and local tax deductions, potentially facing resistance in the House.</p>
