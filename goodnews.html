          <p>An unusual alliance is emerging in the United States, pushing for restrictions on the weedkiller atrazine, which has been linked to reproductive problems and cancer. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading a "Make America Healthy Again" commission that aims to highlight the dangers of pesticides like atrazine. This effort has garnered support from environmental groups, some members of the Trump administration, and men's rights influencers, creating an unwieldy coalition against the powerful agricultural and chemicals lobby. The Environmental Protection Agency, however, faces internal resistance from former industry lobbyists.</p>

          <p>Google is launching a new feature called A.I. Mode in its search engine, aiming to integrate artificial intelligence more deeply into the search experience. This tool will function like a chatbot, providing comprehensive answers and allowing users to ask follow-up questions. CEO Sundar Pichai describes it as a "total reimagining of search." The move comes as Google faces increasing competition from AI-driven platforms and antitrust pressures, and the company is trying to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors can. The A.I. transition could also deepen tensions with web publishers concerned about traffic.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to unveil plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," to protect the United States against missile threats. The project, reminiscent of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, could cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. Gen. Michael Guetlein will lead the effort, which aims to create a comprehensive defense system against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. The plan raises questions about the scale of the system, its potential impact on other vital programs, and its effectiveness against advanced weapons.</p>

As part of Google's push to popularize AI tools, DeepMind and Aronofsky's firm will work with filmmakers, providing access to the text-to-video tool Veo. The first project, "Ancestra," combines live-action filmmaking with AI-generated imagery. This collaboration comes as other companies in Hollywood are making deals to use AI tools, which proponents say can provide more opportunities for filmmakers to test out ideas and show a variety of visuals at a lower cost.</p>

The opera is basically a phantasmagoria of how Schoenberg got to Hollywood, and it is a clever series of short flashbacks of Schoenberg‚Äôs life, with film accompaniment.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency said it wants to see new clinical trials showing Covid shots are still safe and effective before approving them for healthy adults and children, a costly new requirement for pharmaceutical companies that could limit who gets new jabs each year. Previously, the FDA typically approved updated Covid shots for all Americans each year based on simple tests that show they trigger a strong enough antibody response. The FDA recommended different standards of evidence for approval based on patients' risk of getting severely sick from Covid, according to a paper published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
