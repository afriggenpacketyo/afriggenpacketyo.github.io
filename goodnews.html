          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is preparing for a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a prominent role. The move is described as reflecting the next phase of the party's policy renewal and an effort to unify the party. This strategic change comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period during which the party has struggled in opinion polls, often placing third or fourth. The reshuffle aims to present a stronger, more united front against the current Labour government amid ongoing political challenges for the Conservatives.</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero for saving his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Olympic National Park, Washington. The child was bitten by the cougar while on a popular trail with family and was subsequently airlifted to a Seattle trauma center, where they were treated and have since been released. Park rangers located and killed the animal, which was fitted with a tracking collar, shortly after the incident. Witnesses at the scene recounted hearing screams and praised the father's quick actions, stating they believe he saved the child's life by confronting the animal.</p>

The move follows similar announcements from other pharma firms and comes as the industry faces potential U.S. tariffs and pressure to reshore manufacturing.

          <p>A small Norwegian town, Ulefoss, sits atop what is believed to be Europe's largest deposit of rare earth elements, critical metals for modern technology and green energy. The mining company Rare Earths Norway (REN) plans to develop an 'invisible mine' to extract the deposit without displacing the town, addressing potential environmental and subsidence concerns. If successful, the project could significantly reduce the European Union's heavy reliance on China for these crucial materials, a dependency highlighted by recent Chinese export controls. The project represents a major step towards resource independence for Europe, though it faces technical and local challenges.</p>

          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up Moonshot AI has seen a rapid surge in popularity since its recent launch. The large language model is praised by experts for its cost-efficient design, which utilizes a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture to reduce computational costs during training and inference. This approach allows the powerful model to be developed at a fraction of the cost spent by larger competitors like OpenAI. Backed by Alibaba, Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 is available for free, contrasting with the subscription models of Western counterparts and signaling a potential shift in AI development strategy.</p>

The meeting comes amid rising tensions with China in the South China Sea and a looming threat of 20% U.S. tariffs on Filipino goods. Marcos aims to negotiate a bilateral trade deal to avert the tariffs and has indicated a willingness to offer zero tariffs on some U.S. goods. The talks will also focus on a shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, with the U.S. reaffirming its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Major automakers and cell producers are renewing their push to commercialize solid-state batteries, a technology often called the 'holy grail' for electric vehicles due to its potential for higher energy density and safety. Companies like Volkswagen, Toyota, and BYD are targeting commercial production before 2030, with many initially focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology. Despite persistent technical challenges and delays, recent launches of semi-solid-state EVs in China have rejuvenated momentum. However, some analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the high costs and rapid improvements in existing lithium-ion technology which weaken the investment case. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced substantial changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, aiming to restore trust after significant criticism. The changes come after a damning report from the public inquiry chair, who described the payment process as 'profoundly unsatisfactory.' Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. The government will also consult on recognizing the impact of interferon treatment and severe psychological harm, with the adjustments adding an estimated £1 billion to the scheme's cost.</p>
