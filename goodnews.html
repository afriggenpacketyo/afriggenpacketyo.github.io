        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy offers a three-step method for building emotional endurance, which is the capacity to handle stress without being overcome by negative emotions. She suggests using visuals to understand that learning involves struggle, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues, and undertaking small, uncomfortable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. These practices are designed to help individuals view challenges as growth opportunities rather than signs of failure. The article emphasizes that this process helps in developing resilience by making the difficult moments of life feel less grueling.</p>

          <p>Following a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a coalition of European leaders issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for Ukraine. The leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, along with EU officials, insisted that Russia cannot have a veto over Ukraine's potential membership in NATO or the European Union. They also stated that any peace agreement must not impose limitations on Ukraine's armed forces or its alliances. The statement underscores Europe's effort to present a united front and manage the diplomatic fallout from the bilateral talks.</p>

          <p>Following a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. The meeting aims to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which Trump framed as a more durable solution than a ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call between Trump, Zelenskyy, and several European leaders. While the Alaska summit with Putin did not produce a concrete deal, Trump stated it was an "extremely productive meeting" that set the stage for further negotiations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level since tracking began in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and growing concerns about alcohol's health impacts, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The article highlights a significant drop in underage drinking among teenagers as particularly positive news. While acknowledging the social benefits of responsible drinking, the analysis concludes that the overall reduction in alcohol use is a net positive for public health, potentially leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths and illnesses.</p>

          <p>Samsung is regaining ground against Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, largely driven by its innovative foldable phones and a wider range of price points. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share of shipments in the U.S. increased from 23% to 31%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. While Apple still leads, Samsung's Z Fold and Z Flip models are generating significant consumer interest and social media buzz, challenging the dominance of the conventional smartphone design. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer and potentially foldable iPhone models in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first archaeological excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, a decorative piece about 1.5 inches long, was found near the route of a major Roman road and is believed to have belonged to the elite class of the early medieval period. This find is particularly significant as it was located near where a similar object was discovered in 2021, leading experts to speculate that the pair may have been deliberately buried for a religious or ceremonial purpose. The piece will undergo further analysis before potentially being displayed in a museum.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by a fiber-optic cable, making them immune to electronic warfare jamming. The company, Fold, aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase from current models, to strike high-value targets located further from the front lines. This technology is crucial as both Ukraine and Russia increasingly rely on FPV drones, but the extended range presents engineering challenges, such as the increased weight and vulnerability of the longer cable. The development reflects the rapidly evolving nature of drone warfare in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its murder rate falling to levels not seen in decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying and intervening with the small number of individuals most at risk of becoming perpetrators or victims of gun violence. Led by Mayor Brandon Scott, the plan uses a "carrot and stick" approach, offering social services, job training, and housing while also ensuring stricter prosecution for violent repeat offenders. This community-wide effort, involving social workers, police, and prosecutors, marks a significant shift from past policing tactics in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey found that Americans believe the ideal age to start saving for retirement is 27, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While achieving retirement in one's late 50s is possible when starting at 27, it requires aggressive saving. Experts emphasize that the earlier one begins, the more time their investments have to grow, significantly increasing the size of their nest egg over time. Many Americans express regret for not starting their retirement savings sooner. (not investment advice)</p>
