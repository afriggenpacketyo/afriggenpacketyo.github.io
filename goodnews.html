          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom are preparing to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full moon to take on a reddish hue, an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface. The reddish color is a result of sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Visibility will vary across the UK, with eastern regions getting the best and longest views shortly after moonrise.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15 in 2006, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a computer programming prodigy who used his skills to create a website cataloging eucharistic miracles, blending modern technology with his faith. His rapid path to sainthood has inspired a global following, with his tomb in Assisi becoming a major pilgrimage site. The Vatican has recognized two miracles attributed to his intercession, a prerequisite for canonization.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as the new prime minister of Thailand following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. His appointment comes after the previous prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was removed by a court order, ending the Shinawatra dynasty's recent hold on power. Anutin, known for championing Thailand's cannabis decriminalization, secured the position with support from the opposition People's Party. He has pledged to dissolve parliament and call for new elections within four months as a condition of their backing.</p>

The highly anticipated 2023 debut for the Jets, which was meant to end their long championship drought, turned into one of the most crushing moments in the franchise's history. Now 41, Rodgers' move to Pittsburgh comes after the Jets decided to go in a new direction following another disappointing season. The Week 1 matchup is filled with narrative, as the Jets' new quarterback, Justin Fields, will also be facing his former team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has created a novel method for launching tiny robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material on a wet surface, which boils the surrounding water to create bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they generate a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects high into the air. This technique offers precise control over the launch and could also be used to make the small robots swim.</p>
