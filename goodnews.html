          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the revocation of her student visa after she co-authored an op-ed criticizing Israel's actions. The judge stated there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence on Ozturk's part and that her detainment was purely based on her expression of opinion. This article also highlights Tufts University's support for Ozturk and their statement that her op-ed did not violate any university policies.</p>

          <p>A judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing large-scale cuts and layoffs at several federal agencies, as part of a cost-cutting initiative led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of federal employee unions, were likely to prove that the Trump administration exceeded its legal authority in attempting to reorganize and downsize the federal government. The restraining order prevents DOGE and 20 federal agencies from further actions to comply with the executive order, pending further consideration of the case.</p>

          <p>Police in Bristol are using a Nordic Model approach to policing street sex work, focusing on criminalizing the men who buy sex rather than the women selling it. Dedicated teams engage with street sex workers while disrupting kerb crawlers, aiming to combat night-time exploitation and harm. Police officers issue community protection warnings to men caught soliciting sex workers, restricting their access to certain areas and potentially leading to criminal action if they re-offend. This approach aims to safeguard vulnerable women and disrupt the demand that drives the commercial sex industry.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing legislation to prevent governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in the state. Senate Bill 17 (SB17) prohibits entities affiliated with governments designated as national security threats from buying real estate that poses risks to public health or safety. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals. The law includes exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and property intended as a personal homestead.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, despite being too young to compete at the next Winter Olympics, has significantly improved his standing by mastering two quadruple jumps at the age of 15. The high school student has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata and successfully landed a quad toe loop in competition. His physical growth has also been a factor, requiring him to adapt to larger boots and blades. Nishino aims for strong results at the world junior championships and Junior Grand Prix Final in the upcoming season.</p>

The agreement settles claims made in 2022, and Google stated that the settlement does not require any new product changes. Meta has also agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit over allegations of using users' biometric data without permission.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit and is now spiraling back. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact time and location are uncertain. The spacecraft was designed to withstand atmospheric entry, meaning parts of it may survive and reach the surface. If any pieces of the spacecraft survive and are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>
