        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law that mandates pornography websites to verify the age of their visitors. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, stated that requiring age verification is a constitutionally permissible exercise of the state's authority to protect children from sexually explicit content. The ruling affirms that the law does not unconstitutionally burden adults' access to protected speech under the First Amendment. This decision impacts not only Texas but also at least 18 other states that have enacted similar age-verification measures.</p>

          <p>This article examines the monthly income a retiree could expect from a $300,000 annuity purchased at age 65, a strategy gaining attention amid economic uncertainty. Payouts vary based on gender, annuity type, and interest rates, with a 65-year-old man potentially receiving around $1,942 per month and a woman about $1,861. The article explains that while annuities offer guaranteed income, they involve trade-offs like limited liquidity and potential inflation risk.

          <p>A Vox analysis of the Supreme Court's decision on nationwide injunctions argues that the ruling is more nuanced than a complete victory for President Trump. While the court expressed skepticism about broad injunctions, Justice Barrett's opinion leaves open the possibility for them when necessary to provide "complete relief," such as in cases brought by states. The article suggests that while Trump is the immediate beneficiary, the crackdown could benefit future Democratic administrations by reining in "forum shopping." Ultimately, the decision leaves the door open for future legal battles over the scope of judicial power.</p>

Other reasons to switch include seeking more choices, finding better value beyond just the lowest price, or general dissatisfaction with customer service.
