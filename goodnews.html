          <p>British Olympic track cyclist Jack Carlin has announced his retirement from the sport at the age of 28, citing a lack of motivation to continue competing at the highest level. The Scottish athlete, who won four Olympic medals across the Tokyo and Paris games, stated that the fire to compete never returned after he took time off following his last Olympic appearance. Carlin explained that in a sport decided by thousandths of a second, he could not continue without being able to give 100% effort. He expressed contentment with his career achievements and is now exploring a new identity beyond cycling.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed new measures requiring veterinary practices to publish their price lists and disclose their ownership structures. This recommendation follows an investigation that found pet owners pay significantly more at practices owned by large corporate groups compared to independent vets. The CMA's provisional findings suggest that a lack of transparency and competition has contributed to soaring prices in the £6.3 billion sector. Other potential remedies include price caps on medicines and a ban on certain types of financial bonuses for staff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' postseason success has been significantly powered by the bottom half of their batting order, which has consistently outperformed the team's top stars. In their recent 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in NLCS Game 2, hitters from the sixth to ninth spots combined for seven hits and three RBIs, securing the win. This trend has been consistent throughout the playoffs, with this part of the lineup collectively batting over .300 and driving in 14 runs across eight games. Players like Kiké Hernández and Teoscar Hernández have been particularly effective, providing crucial depth and run production.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued that a lower court judge wrongly found him liable without a full trial on the merits. The justices did not comment on their decision, which effectively ends this avenue of appeal for Jones, who filed for bankruptcy in 2022. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families stated they will now focus on enforcing the jury's verdict and making Jones pay for the harm he caused.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the company will soon allow erotic content on ChatGPT for verified adult users as part of a significant policy shift. The change, expected in December, is aligned with a principle of treating adult users like adults and will be implemented alongside more robust age-gating features. Altman stated that initial restrictions were in place to mitigate mental health risks but will be relaxed now that new safety tools and parental controls have been developed. This move comes as OpenAI faces increased scrutiny over its safety practices and has established an expert council to advise on AI's impact on user well-being.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region rose on Wednesday, diverging from losses on Wall Street that were driven by a renewed trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong posted gains, while mainland China's CSI 300 remained flat. The positive sentiment in Asia persisted despite U.S. President Trump criticizing China for not purchasing soybeans and threatening further retribution. This market activity occurred as new data from China showed a larger-than-expected drop in consumer prices, indicating persistent deflationary pressures in its economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a joint U.S.-UK operation, authorities have seized over $14 billion in Bitcoin and charged Chen Zhi, the founder of Cambodia's Prince Group, with masterminding a massive cryptocurrency fraud. Prosecutors allege Zhi ran a sprawling cyber-fraud empire that used forced labor in prison-like compounds to carry out 'pig butchering' scams, defrauding thousands of victims worldwide. The U.S. Department of Justice described it as one of the largest financial takedowns in history. As part of the operation, the UK has also frozen numerous assets linked to Zhi's network, including 19 properties in London.</p>

The win was overshadowed by an early injury to captain Christian Pulisic, who was forced off the field in the 27th minute after several heavy challenges. Australia took a surprise lead with a goal from Jordy Bos, but Wright equalized for the U.S. before halftime and scored the game-winner in the second half.

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized the cover photograph used by Time magazine for a feature on his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire, calling it potentially the "Worst of All Time." Despite describing the accompanying story as relatively good, Trump complained on social media that the photo, taken from a low angle with backlighting, made his hair "disappear" and created a strange halo effect. The former president has a long-documented fascination with appearing on the magazine's cover. The image choice has drawn varied reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to portray him heroically and others finding it unflattering.</p>

          <p>Niccolò De Masi, CEO of quantum computing firm IonQ, has asserted that quantum processing units (QPUs) represent the next major computing cycle and will ultimately begin to replace the graphics processing units (GPUs) that currently dominate the AI industry. He framed this as a natural evolution, similar to how GPUs overtook CPUs for certain tasks, suggesting a future where powerful QPUs work alongside GPUs. This bold prediction comes as the quantum computing sector experiences a surge in investor interest, driven by the immense computational demands of artificial intelligence and a projected multi-billion dollar market by 2040.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a series of bills aimed at increasing safety for minors interacting with artificial intelligence and social media. One new law requires AI chatbot companies to implement safeguards preventing discussions of self-harm with users and to regularly remind minors they are not interacting with a human. Another law will mandate warning labels on social media platforms, informing young users about potential mental health risks. Other legislation increases penalties for creating nonconsensual AI-generated explicit material and requires schools to develop policies for off-campus cyberbullying, reflecting growing concerns over technology's impact on children.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) in Merced County recently cited a driver for using a homemade, hand-drawn license plate on their Nissan Sentra. An officer noticed the unusual plate, which included a creative attempt to replicate the official design with 'California' lettering, the DMV website, and a registration sticker. While the CHP post on social media gave the driver "points for creativity," they also issued a $197 fine for the violation. California law requires all vehicles to be equipped with state-issued license plates, making artistic renditions illegal for road use.</p>
