          <h2>Straight Men and Gossip: Exploring Why They Might Be 'Bad' at It</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 10:16:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the stereotype that straight men are "bad" at gossip and delves into the reasons behind this perception. It challenges the assumption that men don't gossip, citing a 2019 study that found men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates. The article suggests that men's perceived lack of skill in gossiping stems from a lack of cultural opportunities to freely engage in social talk and storytelling. The article posits that men's hesitancy to gossip openly may be linked to fears of appearing "messy" or incriminating themselves, contributing to a broader "loneliness crisis" among men.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Kavanaugh wrote the 6-3 decision stating that Texas and the land developer were not parties in the commission's licensing proceeding and therefore cannot seek judicial review. The case revolved around Interim Storage Partners' license to store 5,000 to 40,000 metric tons of nuclear waste in Andrews County, Texas, with the state raising concerns about storing spent nuclear fuel above the Permian Basin.</p>

          <p>The article discusses current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates and strategies for securing favorable returns in an inflationary economy. It highlights that leading CD accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate, providing an opportunity to lock in high rates for the CD's term. Strategies include considering online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and exploring short-term CDs, which may have higher interest rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs is also suggested as a practical approach to balance short-term gains with long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to soar to 30C (86F) in parts of the country on Thursday, with the heat building steadily throughout the week, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. Nights will also be much warmer, with temperatures in the high teens, and some areas in south-east England may experience a "tropical night" with temperatures not dropping below 20C. The heat is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where temperatures could reach close to 40C in parts of France and Spain. A Met Office study indicates a rapidly increasing risk of 40C temperatures in the UK due to climate change.</p>
