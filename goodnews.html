          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration order that had halted work on the Revolution Wind project, a major offshore wind farm located off the coast of New England. The Danish energy company Orsted announced it will restart construction as soon as possible on the nearly completed project. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable. The Revolution Wind farm is expected to provide power to over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut once it becomes fully operational.</p>

Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital holds a position in the company, referred to Better Home as "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it is poised to disrupt the industry using artificial intelligence. He highlighted its low valuation compared to newly public competitors like Figure Technology Solutions, projecting significant potential growth for the stock in the coming years. The endorsement caused a massive intraday rally for the company's shares. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual spectacle of fall foliage is being delayed by the effects of climate change, with warmer temperatures pushing back the peak color season by about a week compared to historical averages. Experts note that while weather conditions in the spring and summer impact the vibrancy of the colors, rising fall temperatures are the primary driver for the later onset of the change. Leaf-peeping tourism is a multi-billion dollar industry, particularly in New England, and the shifting timeline presents new challenges for predicting the best viewing times. Scientists advise that while online maps provide general guidance, local conditions like elevation and rainfall cause significant variation in when and where the most brilliant colors appear.</p>

          <p>Television producer Phil Rosenthal and renowned chef Nancy Silverton are partnering to open a new diner, Max and Helen’s, in L.A.'s Larchmont Village. The restaurant, named after Rosenthal's parents, aims to elevate classic American diner food by focusing on high-quality ingredients and expert cooking techniques. The concept was inspired by Rosenthal's visit to a diner in Maine while filming his show "Somebody Feed Phil." The menu will feature Silverton's refined takes on staples like patty melts, matzo ball soup, and milkshakes, with the goal of creating a community hub that preserves the welcoming, accessible spirit of traditional American diners.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs not paid by Original Medicare, but premiums vary significantly based on location, plan type, and personal factors. In 2025, monthly premiums can range from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for the most comprehensive coverage. On average, most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level options like Plan G or Plan N. To secure lower costs, experts advise enrolling as soon as one is eligible to avoid penalties for pre-existing conditions, comparing quotes from multiple insurers, and considering plans with higher cost-sharing for lower monthly premiums.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced a massive partnership with OpenAI, planning to invest up to $100 billion to help the AI lab build an unprecedented amount of data center infrastructure. The project aims to deploy Nvidia systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to four to five million of the company's advanced GPUs. This collaboration highlights the critical link between Nvidia's hardware and OpenAI's AI models, which have driven the recent AI boom. The investment will be deployed progressively as the infrastructure is built, solidifying Nvidia's role as a preferred supplier and signaling the immense computational power needed for developing next-generation artificial intelligence.

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has officially become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial for the top spot in both retail and restaurant sales channels. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost its long-held number-one position two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline in popularity coincides with challenges for its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and weaker demand among some consumer groups. The shift in market leadership reflects changing consumer preferences and the successful marketing of Michelob Ultra as a light, low-calorie option.</p>

          <p>A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 4.3 struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking many residents. The quake was centered just east of Berkeley, and while it was felt widely across the region, there have been no immediate reports of major damage or injuries. The shaking prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing systemwide delays for commuters. Local officials confirmed that emergency services received an increase in calls but had not identified any significant impact. The event serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the earthquake-prone region.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has brushed off a heated sideline exchange with tight end Travis Kelce during their win against the New York Giants. Cameras captured the two yelling at each other, with Reid appearing to bump Kelce's shoulder, after the offense failed to score following a turnover. Reid told reporters not to "make too much of it," attributing the incident to Kelce's passionate and emotional nature, which he said he loves. This is not the first on-field dispute between the two, who had a similar, more intense interaction during Super Bowl LVIII, which both later downplayed as part of their competitive relationship.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold surging to a new record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Gold's value has risen over 40% this year, driven by low-interest-rate environments and geopolitical uncertainty. For those looking to invest, most financial experts recommend gaining exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more liquid, cost-effective, and tax-efficient than purchasing and storing physical gold bars or coins. Advisors generally suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A young male elk, nicknamed Emil, who became a social media sensation after wandering across Central Europe for months, has been safely captured in Austria. The elk was tranquilized near a motorway and has been fitted with a GPS tag before being released on the Czech-Austrian border. Authorities hope he will join a small, established elk population in the nearby Sumava forest. Emil's journey covered nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, with his movements eagerly tracked by thousands of followers in online groups. Elk were hunted to extinction in the region centuries ago and have only recently been reintroduced in small numbers.</p>

Tech company Oracle will serve as the security provider, continuously monitoring the system to ensure it is not used for malicious purposes or subject to undue influence. A senior White House official stated that the compromise is designed to meet the legal requirements of both the United States and China, and will save the app for its 170 million American users.</p>
