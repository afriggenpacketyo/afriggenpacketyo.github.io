          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, often synonymous with debt settlement, offers borrowers a chance to have a portion of their balance forgiven through negotiation, bankruptcy, or debt management programs. Qualification typically requires a debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, payment delinquency, and demonstrated financial hardship. While definitions may vary among servicers, borrowers should research and compare debt relief companies to find the most suitable criteria. Exploring all debt relief options and understanding their nuances is crucial for regaining financial freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts cited a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a minor operating margin miss as potential factors contributing to the stock's movement.
