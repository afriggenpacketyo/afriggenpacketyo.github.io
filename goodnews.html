King Charles is scheduled to deliver the Speech from the Throne to Parliament, outlining the government's priorities, marking the first time a monarch has delivered the throne speech in Canada since 1977. The visit is viewed as a reminder of the historical bond between Canada and the Crown, particularly significant during current political and economic challenges with the United States.</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, a U.S. congressman from New York City for 46 years and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Korean War veteran and founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, dedicated his career to fighting for affordable housing, urban revitalization, and equal opportunities. Despite facing ethics violations in 2008, including allegations of tax law violations and improper use of rent-subsidized apartments, Rangel remained a respected figure, leaving behind a legacy of public service and advocacy for his Harlem district.

          <p>King Charles's visit to Canada and his delivery of the Speech from the Throne symbolize the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown, particularly amidst strained ties with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to the King is viewed as a strategic move to emphasize Canada's sovereignty, especially given President Trump's imposition of tariffs and references to Canada as the "51st state." The King's actions, such as wearing Canadian medals and choosing a maple tree for a Buckingham Palace planting, further signal support for Canada during these challenging times. The visit serves as a reminder of shared values of democracy, equality, and peace.</p>

Pugh aimed to change public perceptions of sharks, often portrayed negatively by the film "Jaws," and encourage protections for these at-risk animals. Despite facing frigid waters and challenging conditions, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, which are being killed at an unsustainable rate. His efforts coincide with the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" and the New England Aquarium's first confirmed sighting of a white shark this season, highlighting the need for continued conservation efforts.</p>

Navy divers retrieved dog tags and remains, leading to the official accounting of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are addressing recent struggles of closer Tanner Scott, who has been leaving too many pitches in the middle of the strike zone. Despite a high percentage of pitches in the zone, hitters are making solid contact, leading to blown saves and increased ERA. The Dodgers' coaching staff aims to help Scott locate his fastball better and induce more chase on his slider, even if it means more walks. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial, and the team hopes these adjustments will stabilize the bullpen and improve his effectiveness in save situations.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the former dean of New York‚Äôs congressional delegation and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at 94. Rangel, a mainstay of Harlem‚Äôs Democratic old guard, was first elected to Congress in 1970 and served longer than any other New Yorker but one. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to enter electoral politics by running for the Senate from New York when Daniel Patrick Moynihan retired. Although he ventured politically beyond Harlem only once, unsuccessfully seeking the Democratic nomination for City Council president in 1969, he won re-election with monster margins in a district where, by 2010, only about one in three residents was Black.</p>
