          <p>The NJ Transit strike ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen approved a deal, with train service resuming on Tuesday. The three-day strike, the first in decades, impacted hundreds of thousands of commuters traveling to New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy hailed the agreement as fair and fiscally responsible, though specifics were not disclosed. The union had been seeking pay parity with neighboring transit agencies and cost of living increases, while NJ Transit expressed concerns about budget implications. Trains may not be operational until Tuesday due to the need to inspect train cars and tracks, and commuters are encouraged to work from home on Monday to facilitate the return to full service.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker, the host of Match of the Day, is expected to leave the BBC, with an announcement anticipated soon, possibly after presenting his final show next weekend. This follows recent controversy over a social media post containing an antisemitic image, for which Lineker apologized. He was previously suspended in March 2023 for impartiality issues related to tweets about a government asylum policy. Lineker had announced his departure from Match of the Day in November 2024 but was slated to continue with FA Cup and World Cup coverage. Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman, and Gabby Logan have been named as new presenters for Match of the Day starting in the 2025-26 season.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler claimed victory at the PGA Championship, marking his third major title with a five-shot lead. Despite a shaky start where he briefly lost his lead, Scheffler demonstrated resilience on the back nine, closing with an even-par 71. Jon Rahm, who posed a significant challenge, faltered in the final holes, while Bryson DeChambeau and others were unable to sustain momentum. Scheffler's win underscores his dominance as the world's No. 1 golfer, solidifying his position alongside legends like Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. This is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in talks aimed at redefining their relationship, driven by the changing global landscape, including the war in Ukraine and concerns about European security. While the UK government has stated it will not rejoin the EU's customs union, single market, or reinstate freedom of movement, discussions are focused on areas such as trade, security, and youth mobility. The Labour manifesto serves as a guide for the government's objectives, including improving trade relations, removing barriers to trade, and establishing a veterinary agreement. The EU is particularly interested in a youth mobility scheme, which the UK government is now acknowledging and considering, despite initial reservations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor from Massachusetts, is the subject of a new Hulu documentary highlighting her pioneering work in profiling serial killers for the FBI. Beginning in the 1960s, Burgess interviewed sexual assault victims and identified patterns in offenders' behavior, leading her to consult with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. Her insights into the thinking of serial killers, gleaned from hundreds of hours of interviews, helped transform investigative techniques. The documentary also touches on the sexism she faced and her current work profiling school shooters and addressing unsolved murders within the Indigenous population. Burgess continues to teach and inspire, emphasizing the importance of recognizing behavioral patterns to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are intensifying due to climate change, with predictions indicating a doubling of wildfire risk by 2100 due to increasing droughts and reduced rainfall. A recent report highlights that approximately 60,000 forest fires occur annually in the EU, resulting in significant economic losses. Factors such as climate change, land use practices, and urbanization contribute to the increased fire danger. Experts emphasize the need for preventative measures, ecosystem restoration, and public education to mitigate the impact of wildfires. Controlled burning and sustainable forest management are also proposed as potential solutions.</p>

          <p>Anduril Industries is developing the Fury, an unmanned fighter jet designed to use artificial intelligence and fly without a pilot. The aircraft is intended to work in coordination with a manned aircraft, providing support and protection. Anduril CEO Brian Schrimpf emphasized that Fury is an autonomous fighter jet with software that can sense and understand everything going on in the airspace, and is able to react. Fury is scheduled to take its first test flight this summer, and the Air Force hopes to have collaborative combat aircrafts fully operational before the end of this decade.</p>
