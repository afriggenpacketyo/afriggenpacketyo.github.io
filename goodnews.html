          <p>The United Kingdom is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day with a series of events spanning four days, from May 5th to 8th. The commemorations include a military procession from Whitehall to Buckingham Palace, featuring over 1,300 armed forces personnel and members of the public, alongside a flypast by the Red Arrows and historic military aircraft. King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony and host a tea party for war veterans, while communities across the country will hold street parties and gatherings to echo the celebrations of 1945, with pubs extending their hours for the occasion. The Tower of London will also unveil an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, and various musical performances and museum exhibitions will honor the occasion, reflecting on the personal stories and the nation's understanding of the war today.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This adjustment follows criticism that the initial full clawback rate was excessively harsh and could lead to homelessness for beneficiaries reliant on these funds. While experts acknowledge that the reduced rate is an improvement, they still warn that losing half of their benefits can create significant financial strain for affected individuals, especially since overpayments often result from agency errors or unreported changes in circumstances. The agency had briefly increased the withholding rate to 100% before reverting to the 50% rate, sparking concerns about the financial stability of retirees and disabled individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of America's movie industry and a 'National Security threat' due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. This proposal has sparked concerns within the film industry, with unions warning of a potential 'knock-out blow' and questions arising about the definition of a 'US film' and the scope of the tariffs' application to streaming services. While some countries like Australia and New Zealand have expressed support for their screen industries, others warn that retaliatory tariffs could harm the industry further, making it harder for American films to profit overseas.</p>

Many states are behind on compliance, with New Jersey having the lowest compliance rate.

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence invoked the Constitution and said it is what "binds us all together" after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence's comments came hours after an interview aired in which President Trump was noncommittal on whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Pence made several references to the Trump administration, but never mentioned the president during his 10-minute speech.</p>
