          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a joint resolution to amend the state constitution, explicitly stating that only U.S. citizens can vote in Texas elections. The resolution, introduced by State Senator Brian Birdwell, aims to clarify existing constitutional prohibitions on non-citizen voting. While Abbott has signed the resolution, Texas citizens will have the final say in November on whether to ratify the amendment to the state constitution. This move comes amid ongoing debates about election integrity and proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters, as well as the blocking of an executive order by President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Small-scale distillers in Japan are increasingly producing craft gins using homegrown ingredients, fueling a domestic gin boom. Distillers are using botanicals and local specialties to create unique gins, differentiating themselves from mass-produced spirits. One distillery owner, Yudai Matsuzaki, uses juniper berries from a forest where he played as a child, emphasizing the taste of his hometown. The industry has benefited from the adaptability of existing whiskey and shochu distillation equipment, and the quick monetization from production to sales.</p>

          <p>As rocket launches become more frequent, physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight to understand and mitigate the impact of sonic booms on communities. Kent Gee and his team at Brigham Young University are analyzing the unique three-part sonic boom generated by SpaceX's Falcon 9 boosters. Their research aims to inform regulations and limits for rocket noise, which can shake windows and disrupt communities. The team is also preparing to study the even louder Starship rocket, emphasizing the need to address noise concerns before spaceflight becomes more pervasive.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has lost its status as the world's top creditor, now surpassed by Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets reaching a record high, the weaker yen boosted the value of its foreign-currency assets, which were not enough to offset Germany's large current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased to 533.05 trillion yen, but Germany's totaled 569.65 trillion yen. Japan remains the second-largest holder of net external assets, followed by China, while the United States has a net external liability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9 to allow time for negotiations. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious trade discussions. Trump‚Äôs initial threat to impose tariffs had caused market instability, and the delay is intended to facilitate a potential agreement. Both sides expressed a commitment to advancing talks swiftly and decisively.</p>
