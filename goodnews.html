          <p>McDonald's and Krispy Kreme are terminating their partnership, with Krispy Kreme doughnuts no longer being sold at McDonald's locations after July 2nd. McDonald's indicated that while the collaboration was beneficial for them, it was not sustainable for Krispy Kreme's business model. Krispy Kreme's CEO cited unsuccessful efforts to align costs with unit demand as the reason for ending the partnership. Krispy Kreme will now concentrate on expanding through high-volume retail distribution points and international franchise growth, and the agreement was considered a minor aspect of McDonald's breakfast offerings. Optimism remains moderate as both companies refocus on their core strategies.</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from the late 2000s, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic, remembered for its humorous and over-the-top approach to combating anti-LGBTQ+ language. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to discourage the use of the word "gay" as an insult. The ad's success is attributed to Duff's popularity among youth and the Advertising Council's support. While the media landscape has changed, the ad's impact is still felt, with many crediting it for raising awareness and reducing bullying rates.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Tehran faces limited and unfavorable options, including military escalation or diplomatic concessions. A military response could involve attacks on U.S. forces or allies, while diplomatic options require accepting stringent demands for nuclear disarmament and regional limitations. Regardless of Iran's choice, the situation presents an opportunity for a positive transformation of the Middle East, potentially strengthening a regional coalition against Iran and reducing proliferation risks. The U.S. has also bolstered its global standing compared to Russia and China, and an Israel without an existential threat from Iran could make progress on the Palestinian issue.</p>

The airline will also monitor can temperatures to keep them at room temperature and prevent further incidents.

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is reducing its holdings in CrowdStrike and Eaton to capitalize on recent market gains, driven by easing geopolitical tensions. The decision to trim CrowdStrike does not alter the long-term positive outlook for the cybersecurity firm, as the cyber threat environment remains elevated. Similarly, the Eaton sale does not reflect a change in the view that its electrical products will be in high demand for years due to their critical role in helping to solve the energy needs of data centers.

          <p>Maggie Gram's book, *The Invention of Design*, explores the evolution of design from commercial art to a broader discipline addressing societal issues. The field has shifted from beautifying objects to solving complex problems, but design thinking's utopian projects often fall short. Social scientists in tech companies promoted a "human-centered" approach, but profit often took priority. While design can contribute to positive change, it requires political consensus and participatory methods to address "wicked problems" effectively, as exemplified by Sylvia Harris's work on the U.S. census.</p>

While challenges remain, such as waitlists and unequal access, Quebec's model has influenced the development of a Canada-wide childcare system.

He stressed the central bank's commitment to preventing tariff-related price increases from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.
