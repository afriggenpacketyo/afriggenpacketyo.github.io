          <p>Turkey is debating new regulations to address significant food waste generated by popular all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional large breakfasts. Advisors to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are working on proposals, prompted by reports that 8.7 million tons of food are discarded annually in Turkey, with individuals wasting an average of 102 kilograms each year. A restaurateur and council member, Ramazan Bingol, advocates for à la carte options and customizable breakfast packages to reduce waste. While hotels are not the primary source of food waste globally, the proposed changes aim to mitigate environmental damage and conserve resources. The article highlights the country's efforts to tackle a substantial economic and ecological issue.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a new congressional map, a move backed by former President Donald Trump, aimed at bolstering Republican chances of maintaining their majority in the U.S. House next year. This redistricting effort creates five additional Republican-leaning congressional districts in Texas. The legislative victory occurred despite weeks of Democratic lawmakers fleeing the state to deny a quorum and stall the process. Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign the measure into law, setting the stage for a significant shift in the balance of power ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The article emphasizes the partisan nature of the redistricting and its potential impact on national politics.</p>

Her schedule includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, double gym sessions, and often eating during meetings due to a lack of lunch breaks. Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and CEO of Passes, believes work-life balance comes from cutting out time-wasting activities like 'doom scrolling.' She advocates for a 90-hour work week for new founders, asserting it's necessary to get companies off the ground. While her views on extreme work hours are controversial among some in Silicon Valley, Guo credits her success to this relentless dedication.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has extended a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and 30 other 'sanctuary' cities and counties. These jurisdictions have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration efforts. The judge ruled that the administration's executive orders, which aimed to withhold federal money, constituted an unconstitutional "coercive threat." This decision is a significant setback for the Trump administration's efforts to pressure localities into assisting with immigration enforcement and deportations. The article highlights the ongoing legal battle between the federal government and local authorities over immigration policies.
