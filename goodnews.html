          <p>A popular Mexican band, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, was fined over $36,000 for performing songs that glorified drug cartels during a concert in Chihuahua. City officials stated that nearly a third of their songs, known as "narcocorridos," promoted illegal activities and their perpetrators. Restrictions on this subgenre of regional music are increasing across Mexico, sometimes leading to unrest. The United States has also revoked visas for musicians showing support for wanted drug lords, highlighting the consequences of expressing support for criminals through artistic expression. This issue underscores the intersection of freedom of expression and its potential impact on society, especially among young people.</p>

          <p>Ispace, a private Japanese company, is attempting a lunar landing with its Resilience lander in the unexplored northern region of the moon. This follows the company's previous failed attempt, which ended in a crash landing, and aims to deploy a mini rover named Tenacious to gather lunar soil. The mission seeks to scout the area with a high-definition camera and conduct experiments related to lunar infrastructure development, including electrolysis and food production. The CEO considers this mission a stepping stone towards establishing a permanent human presence on the moon, as other companies also plan lunar landings this year.</p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise announced plans to move its primary listing to the U.S., a move that presents a blow to the London stock exchange. The company stated it will shift to a dual listing, with the main hub moving to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. Wise indicated that this change would allow its shares to trade on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, which is a move that led to shares of Wise trading almost 11% higher Thursday morning.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the "China shock" narrative, which blames China's rise for the decline of American manufacturing, is not supported by rigorous evidence. The author cites research suggesting that the negative effects of trade with China have been exaggerated and that job losses in exposed areas were often offset by gains in other sectors. The author also notes that the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry and that former manufacturing workers generally did not face permanent unemployment. The author concludes that the real shock America faces is from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering legislation to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes from financial collapse following wildfires. AB 226 would make the FAIR Plan eligible for loans and bonds from the state-backed California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. Other bills aim to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. The proposed measures seek to address issues highlighted by recent fires and ensure the FAIR Plan remains solvent in emergencies.</p>

Colbert's election marks a precedent in a wealthy, predominantly white county, bringing a unique perspective to local government. Colbert says he thinks of the challenges and indignities his grandparents suffered under Jim Crow, and the hope they had for a better future for their descendants. Colbert hopes to make local government more accessible and responsive.</p>

          <p>Six California gubernatorial candidates, four Democrats and two Republicans, participated in a bipartisan forum to discuss the state's affordability crisis. The candidates agreed that the high cost of living is a pressing issue, but their strategies for improving the state's economy diverged along party lines. The candidates discussed housing costs, high-speed rail, tariffs, climate change, and homelessness, with Democrats emphasizing the need for higher wages and Republicans advocating for reduced regulations. The event marked the first time Democratic and Republican candidates have shared a stage in the 2026 governor race.</p>
