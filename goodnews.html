          <p>California lawmakers have passed several controversial bills aimed at transforming the student experience, which now await Governor Gavin Newsom's approval. One major bill mandates a phonics-based "science of reading" approach to address lagging literacy scores, moving away from other teaching methods. Another measure seeks to phase out ultra-processed foods like chicken nuggets and corn dogs from school cafeterias to improve student health. A third bill, AB 715, establishes a state Office for Civil Rights to combat discrimination in schools, with specific coordinators for issues like antisemitism, after concerns were raised over ethnic studies curricula.</p>

          <p>Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil has disclosed that he suffered a severe stroke last Christmas, which resulted in the paralysis of his entire left side. The health crisis was so serious that his doctors initially doubted he would be able to walk or perform on stage again. Neil explained that he had to undergo intensive physical therapy, progressing from being carried to using a wheelchair, a walker, and a cane. After months of recovery, the singer says he is now at 95% of his previous health and has successfully returned to performing with the band for their rescheduled Las Vegas residency.</p>

          <p>The Taliban's acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, reportedly met with US diplomats, including special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler and former envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. According to a statement from the Taliban, the discussions focused on developing bilateral relations, citizen-related issues, and investment opportunities in Afghanistan. This meeting follows the recent release of US citizen George Glezmann, who was detained by the Taliban in 2022. The United States has not officially recognized the Taliban government and did not immediately confirm the details of the meeting reported by the Islamist group.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached new record highs this week, driven by speculation about the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. A significant catalyst was Oracle's blowout earnings report, which saw its stock surge and boosted related chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom due to strong AI infrastructure demand. Mixed economic data, including a lower-than-expected producer price index and a higher consumer price index, has created uncertainty but also opened the door for potential rate cuts. The market's strong performance reflects investor optimism despite conflicting signals about inflation and the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Ukraine and US to Identify Investment Projects Under New Minerals Agreement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian and U.S. officials are conducting site visits to identify potential investment projects as part of a new minerals deal signed in April. The agreement grants the United States preferential access to Ukraine's mineral resources in exchange for investment, a move heavily promoted by President Donald Trump. Ukraine's Economy Minister, Oleksiy Sobolev, stated the goal is to select three pilot projects within 18 months to help revive the nation's war-torn economy. The deal stipulates that half of the revenue from new mineral extraction will go to a joint investment fund, with profits split between Kyiv and Washington.</p>

          <h2>New French Prime Minister Abandons Proposal to Eliminate Two Public Holidays</h2>

          <p>France's new Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, has announced he is dropping a controversial proposal from his predecessor to eliminate two public holidays as a budget-cutting measure. The decision comes as Lecornu's government faces pressure after Fitch downgraded France's sovereign credit rating, a move he attributed to political instability. Lecornu, President Macron's fifth prime minister in under two years, is tasked with passing a debt-reducing budget through a deeply divided parliament. He has pledged to find "creative ways" to work with opposition parties to achieve financial stability without resorting to the unpopular holiday cuts.</p>

          <p>Arsenal demonstrated the value of its £250 million summer transfer investment with a convincing 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest, even while missing several key players due to injury. Five of the club's eight new signings started the match, contributing to a performance that highlighted the team's enhanced squad depth. Newcomers Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze were particularly impressive, with Eze assisting a goal for fellow new signing Viktor Gyokeres. The victory suggests that manager Mikel Arteta's strategy of aggressive recruitment has provided the resilience needed to compete for titles and manage a demanding schedule, including upcoming Champions League fixtures.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed SB 53, a bill requiring developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to publish detailed safety and security reports before deployment. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, focuses on mitigating potential "catastrophic risks," defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled bioweapons or cyberattacks. While proponents argue it creates necessary public accountability for major AI companies like OpenAI and Google, some industry groups oppose it, citing compliance costs and potential stifling of innovation. The bill represents a significant state-level effort to regulate fast-moving AI technology amid federal gridlock.</p>

          <p>A couple who left their New York City lives for two years to live nomadically in ten different cities reflects on the positive impacts of the experience. By selling 90% of their belongings, they learned to value experiences over possessions and became minimalists, a practice they continue today. The constant change forced them to break out of monotonous routines, try new things, and explore different parts of the country. They also found that by sharing short-term rentals and shopping less, they saved money, which allowed them to afford a better apartment upon returning to Brooklyn to start a family.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges against 61 individuals protesting the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state attorney general's office lacked the authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to prosecute, a significant blow to the state's two-year effort. This decision effectively collapses the core of the state's controversial indictment, which sought to frame the protest movement as an organized criminal enterprise. The state has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which experts are calling a major failure in prosecuting a protest movement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical professor of dermatology is advising consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names when selecting lip oils, amid social media reports of hyperpigmentation. The thin skin on lips is more susceptible to sun damage, and oils without SPF can magnify UV exposure, potentially leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, especially in people of color. Irritating ingredients used for plumping effects, as well as common fragrances like peppermint and citrus, can also cause dermatitis. For safer use, consumers should look for products with broad-spectrum SPF and hydrating components like hyaluronic acid while avoiding fragrances and certain oleic acids.</p>

          <p>In response to a historic drought that severely restricted traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with major infrastructure projects to ensure future water security. Plans include the construction of the Rio Indo dam and a new land bridge featuring a natural gas pipeline to transport energy products without relying on the canal's water levels. These investments are critical as the canal, which depends on fresh water from rainfall, is vital to global trade, with the U.S. being its largest user. The projects, costing billions, aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change and are expected to be completed over the next decade.</p>
