          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that courts will support President Trump's tariff agenda, despite a recent federal court setback.

Hassett stated that the White House expects "Plan A" to work out, believing the judges will uphold the law. He added that the administration has alternative plans if a judge rules against them, emphasizing the importance of fair American trade. (not investment advice)</p>
