          <p>King Charles III is visiting Ottawa to highlight Canada's sovereignty in response to President Donald Trump's suggestions of annexation. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda.

The visit is intended to send a clear message of Canada's independence and distinct identity, even as the U.S. Ambassador downplays the need for such gestures.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed imposing 50 percent tariffs on all imports from the European Union until July 9 to allow more time for trade negotiations. Trump spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, about his threat to enact the tariffs on June 1. Both sides expressed a need for more time to reach a trade deal, with the E.U. offering to reduce tariffs on industrial goods and increase purchases of U.S. energy. This decision follows criticism that Trump's trade policies have injected uncertainty into the global economy.</p>
