The company announced it has also completed piloted flight tests in Dubai, moving closer to its planned 2026 commercial air taxi service launch in the region.

          <p>Following a remarkable 65% price increase over the past 18 months, gold investors are now considering the potential for price movements in July. This article analyzes key economic factors, suggesting that the precious metal's price is likely to remain relatively stable. With inflation holding steady and the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates until at least September, two major drivers of gold price volatility are currently muted. While unpredictable geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard that could shift market sentiment, the current economic climate points towards a period of consolidation for gold rather than another dramatic spike or decline in its value.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially ending the U.S. sanctions program on Syria, a move intended to support the country's new transitional government. The order lifts broad economic sanctions but maintains targeted penalties against former president Bashar al-Assad and his associates, as well as those linked to human rights abuses and terrorism. This action follows months of lobbying by the new Syrian government for sanctions relief to aid in reconstruction and stabilize the economy after years of civil war. U.S. allies in the region, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, have supported normalizing relations, viewing it as an opportunity to foster stability and counter Iranian influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dating app Tinder is now requiring users in California to verify their identity using a mandatory facial recognition feature called Face Check. This new measure is being tested to combat the rise of fraud, fake profiles, and romance scams on the platform. The system, powered by FaceTec technology, prompts new users to record a short video selfie, which is then used to confirm they are a real person and that their appearance matches their profile photos. While the company states the data is deleted 30 days after an account is closed, the move highlights a growing trend of tech platforms using biometric data to enhance security and user trust, though it also raises privacy considerations.</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock surged 10% to an all-time high after the company announced it will offer tokenized shares of private companies OpenAI and SpaceX to its European users. This move marks the company's first venture into making private equity accessible to retail investors through blockchain technology, a step facilitated by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. The tokenized assets are part of a broader expansion of Robinhood's crypto services in Europe, which now include over 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs. While regulatory hurdles prevent a similar offering in the U.S. for now, the initiative represents a significant step towards democratizing access to pre-IPO investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the first six months of 2025, this market analysis emphasizes the importance of staying invested despite volatility, such as the downturn caused by President Trump's tariff announcements. The article suggests that Trump's aggressive negotiating style often leads to outcomes less severe than initially threatened, creating buying opportunities for disciplined, long-term investors. It advises focusing on company earnings and resilient sectors like cybersecurity and value retail, which can weather economic uncertainty. The key lesson is that panic is not a viable strategy; instead, investors should analyze how geopolitical and economic headlines will concretely impact corporate growth and earnings before making rash decisions.

          <p>The seventh installment in the Jurassic franchise, "Jurassic World Rebirth," is a significant disappointment, functioning as a generic monster movie with little of the wonder or prestige of the original. This article's review criticizes the film for its uninspired plot, in which a new cast including Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali land on an island to exploit dinosaur DNA and inevitably get chomped. The movie is described as incurious about its creatures and barely invested in its human characters, with bloodless action and brazenly strange product placement. Despite a screenplay from the original writer and a capable director, the film fails to innovate, instead delivering a tired retread that suggests the franchise itself should go extinct.</p>
