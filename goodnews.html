          <h2>Trump Administration Opts Against Mandating Medicaid Coverage for GLP-1 Obesity Drugs, While Some States Proceed Independently</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 20:19:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration will not finalize a rule allowing Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment, despite some states like South Carolina choosing to cover these weight loss drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. GLP-1s are a pricey class of drugs that have shown promise in treating obesity, but access remains limited due to cost concerns among insurers. South Carolina Medicaid requires beneficiaries to meet stringent prerequisites, including documented efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests future coverage may be possible as costs decrease. The state anticipates that only a small fraction of obese adults will access this benefit due to rigorous approval processes.

          <p>NHS England will be the first country to offer a gonorrhoea vaccine, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with multiple partners or a history of STIs, in an effort to combat soaring infection rates. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea, and NHS England hopes it will reverse the surge in cases and reduce the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains. Vaccination will commence in August through sexual health services. Public Health Scotland is also planning a similar program for high-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled plans to begin building a sophisticated new missile defense shield that could intercept threats from space, estimating the endeavor would cost some $175 billion and become operational in three years. The project "Golden Dome," which will be led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, echoes President Ronald Reagan's failed "Star Wars" program, which was criticized for being overly ambitious and siphoning money away from other national priorities. The White House cited advancements in technology as a reason why some of Reagan's vision was now possible.</p>
