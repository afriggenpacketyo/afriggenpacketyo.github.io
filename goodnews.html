          <p>'Trans Los Angeles,' directed by Kase Pe침a, is a feature film composed of three vignettes that portray the diverse experiences of transgender individuals in Los Angeles. Inspired by a lack of representation, Pe침a's film explores themes such as ICE raids, spirituality, sex work, and relationships within the trans community. The film's structure was influenced by the Soviet/Cuban political work 'Soy Cuba,' and it was filmed over several years due to funding constraints. Pe침a aims to highlight the struggles and beauty of being human in L.A., emphasizing the importance of freedom and self-expression for transgender individuals.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, according to Global Energy Monitor (GEM). This trend is expected to advance the clean energy transition and potentially reduce a surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. In mainland China, 90 former coal mines are operating as solar-power facilities with a total generating capacity of 14 gigawatts, and an additional 46 projects are in the planning stages. Such projects offer a way to combine land restoration, job creation, and clean energy deployment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals can choose the gender they identify with when renewing or applying for a passport. The ruling expands on a previous decision and addresses an executive order issued by Mr. Trump that reversed a policy allowing Americans to self-select their gender, including an 'X' for those who do not identify as male or female. The ACLU praised the decision, stating that the policy attacked the right to privacy and the freedom to live with dignity.</p>
