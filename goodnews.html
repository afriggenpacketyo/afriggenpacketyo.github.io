          <p>Following an audit by Baroness Louise Casey, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.  The inquiry will have the power to compel witnesses to testify.  This decision follows months of criticism for not launching such an inquiry and reverses an earlier government stance.  The inquiry's establishment is expected to take time but will be conducted under the Inquiries Act.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that he alone defines the meaning of "America First," rejecting criticism from figures like Tucker Carlson.  Trump defended his administration's foreign policy, expressing optimism about world affairs and claiming progress in various conflicts.  He discussed upcoming negotiations with Iran and the situation in Gaza, while also mentioning a planned phone call with Vladimir Putin.  Trump's stance contrasts with Carlson's view that U.S. support for Israel's actions against Iran contradicts "America First" principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wave refraction, the bending of waves as they pass over changing depths, significantly impacts how waves break.  Concave refraction, focusing energy towards the middle of the wave, creates powerful waves like those at Pipeline.  Convex refraction, defocusing energy, is common at point breaks like J-Bay.  Beach breaks are influenced by a combination of factors, including swell period and sandbar interaction, which can result in hollow waves or closeouts.</p>
