          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and her expressed fondness for the color orange, numerous major brands have launched orange-themed social media campaigns to align with her immense cultural and economic influence. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix quickly adopted orange hues in their marketing after the singer discussed the color's personal significance on the "New Heights" podcast. This rapid corporate response highlights the significant economic impact of Swift's brand, as her previous tours have generated substantial revenue for local economies, prompting businesses to seek association with her ongoing success.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has completed the signing of 18-year-old center-back Giovanni Leoni from Italian club Parma in a deal worth £26 million plus add-ons. The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the Premier League club until 2031. Leoni, who only made his senior debut in 2023, is seen as a strategic acquisition for the future, especially with key defenders like Virgil van Dijk aging. Despite his limited top-flight experience, Leoni's impressive aerial ability and composure in possession have marked him as a promising talent capable of providing immediate cover for Liverpool's defense.</p>

The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The investment by Buffett, along with new stakes from other prominent investors like Michael Burry and David Tepper, is seen as a major vote of confidence, potentially signaling a turnaround for the struggling company and the managed care sector.

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has occurred in The Geysers geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, where steam is withdrawn and cold water is injected back into the ground, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift. These minor quakes are not associated with major fault lines like the San Andreas.</p>

          <p>Despite economic challenges in Europe and China, U.S. consumers continue to drive strong sales in the jewelry market, according to major brands like Pandora and Richemont. Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, a stark contrast to declines in China and several European markets. This trend is supported by broader industry data showing a 5% increase in U.S. jewelry sales in the first half of the year. However, jewelry brands face headwinds from potential U.S. tariffs, particularly on goods manufactured in Asia, and rising prices for materials like silver and gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opendoor CEO Resigns Amid Investor Pressure, Stock Jumps 10%</h2>

          <p>Opendoor CEO Carrie Wheeler has resigned from the online real estate company following a pressure campaign from investors, including co-founder Keith Rabois and hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. The company's stock, which had recently surged due to interest from retail investors, rose another 10% on the news. Wheeler's departure comes after a disappointing quarterly earnings report failed to convince investors of a successful turnaround for the company, which uses technology to buy and sell homes. Opendoor has named its technology chief as interim leader while it begins a search for a permanent CEO.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Real Estate Market Reveals Cities Where Mansions Are Still Available for Under $1 Million</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 12:08:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Zillow analysis shows that while the median price for a mansion—defined as a home with at least 5,000 square feet—is now $1.4 million nationwide, there are still a few U.S. cities where such properties can be purchased for under $1 million. Metro areas like Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, offer large homes below this price point, reflecting broader regional affordability trends. Just a few years ago, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued under $1 million, but today that figure has dropped to around 30%, with the most expensive markets concentrated on the coasts.</p>

          <p>Charity leader Krish Kandiah has offered an "olive branch" to UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick after a dispute over comments made on a BBC radio program. During a 'Thought for the Day' segment, Kandiah accused Jenrick of xenophobia for remarks about migrants, prompting the BBC to apologize and edit the segment. Kandiah has since reached out on social media, suggesting they work together to de-escalate tensions and focus on real issues like housing and the cost of living, rather than anti-immigrant sentiment. He recalled previously working with Jenrick on welcoming refugees from Hong Kong.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FluMist nasal spray, the only non-injection flu vaccine approved by the FDA, is now available for self-administration at home in 34 states. This marks the first time a flu vaccine can be delivered directly to consumers for at-home use, a change approved by the FDA last year. The service, called FluMist Home, allows individuals aged 2 to 49 to order the vaccine online, where it is often covered by commercial insurance with a small shipping fee. The initiative aims to increase vaccination access, though it is not yet available in all states due to varying local pharmacy laws.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla joined World War Two veterans at the National Memorial Arboretum to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, which signaled the end of the war. The ceremony honored the service and sacrifice of the British, Commonwealth, and Allied forces who fought in the Far East, often referred to as the "Forgotten Army." In an audio message, the King paid tribute to the veterans' courage and noted the immense suffering endured by both soldiers and civilians. The event included wreath-layings, a two-minute silence, and a flypast by historic aircraft.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Minimum Payments on a $3,000 Credit Card Balance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 11:32:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how credit card companies calculate minimum monthly payments, which for a $3,000 balance typically range from $55 to $85, depending on the interest rate and the issuer's formula. It warns that only paying the minimum can trap consumers in a long-term debt cycle, costing thousands in interest over many years due to compounding. To escape this trap, the article advises paying more than the minimum whenever possible. It also outlines alternative debt relief strategies, such as balance transfers, debt consolidation loans, and credit counseling, for those unable to make larger payments.</p>
