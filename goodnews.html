          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Steady on Interest Rates Amid Rising Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 15:18:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its key interest rate, citing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook and potential risks of both higher unemployment and inflation. The decision reflects concerns over the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies, particularly tariffs, which could aggravate inflation while slowing economic growth, raising the specter of stagflation. While the economy remains solid, policymakers are adopting a patient approach to calibrate monetary policy, closely monitoring trade negotiations and conflicting economic signals. Stocks showed resilience, recovering after an initial dip following the announcement, indicating market participants are factoring in the potential negative implications of trade shocks.</p>

          <p>Disney plans to open a new theme park in Abu Dhabi, partnering with Miral, the developer of Yas Island's entertainment complex. The park will feature iconic Disney stories and attractions, combined with Abu Dhabi's culture and architecture. The decision to build in Abu Dhabi has raised questions given the UAE's human rights record. Disney has faced criticism for its stances on LGBTQ+ policies in Florida, but CEO Bob Iger emphasized the opportunities in the region, stating that building a theme park there is a strong endorsement of the location. No opening date has been announced.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Preparing an emergency go bag doesn't have to be expensive or overwhelming; experts suggest building it gradually, using existing supplies, and buying used items. Essential items include a sturdy bag, at least a gallon of water, three days' worth of calorie-dense food, personal medications, and basic first-aid equipment. Important documents, emergency supplies like a multi-tool and flashlight, personal hygiene items, a power bank, and some cash are also crucial. Regular maintenance and a basic emergency plan are key to ensuring preparedness for potential disasters.</p>

          <h2>The Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady Amid Concerns Over Trump's Trade Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold interest rates steady, despite pressure from President Trump to lower them, as policymakers assess the economic impact of his trade policies. The central bank cited rising economic risks and uncertainty, pointing to the potential for higher unemployment and inflation. Economists anticipate that Trump's tariffs will likely boost inflation later in the year, which could prompt the Fed to cut rates. The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach, waiting for clarity on the economic effects of the trade policies.</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices have jumped to their highest level since October 2023, driven by consumer concerns about potential price increases due to auto tariffs. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, rose 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% from March. Cox Automotive noted that the typical "spring bounce" in prices extended throughout April, indicating strong price appreciation in response to tariff anxieties. Consumers are rushing to purchase used vehicles before prices potentially climb further.</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners should understand the strategic implications of using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). HELOCs offer a cheaper way to borrow home equity, but come with variable interest rates. Borrowers should consider HELOCs as they are likely to become less expensive in the future, but also understand that there is volatility in the market.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady, the article explores the potential impact on mortgage rates. While the Fed's actions influence the broader interest rate environment, mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which is affected by factors like inflation, economic growth, and investor sentiment. The Fed's pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, but it is not guaranteed. The article advises prospective homebuyers and homeowners to improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and consider various loan types to secure competitive rates.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rates, the article analyzes whether a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan is the better option for borrowers. While home equity loans were traditionally preferred during rate pauses due to their fixed rates, HELOCs now offer lower average rates and the potential for further declines if the Fed resumes rate cuts. Borrowers should carefully consider their risk tolerance and ability to manage variable payments before choosing a HELOC, and ensure affordability both now and in the future.</p>
