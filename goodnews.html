          <p>Keegan Bradley won the Travelers Championship by a single shot, denying Tommy Fleetwood his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood, who held a three-shot lead going into the final round, struggled on the 18th hole, missing a crucial putt for par after a decent tee shot. Bradley capitalized, sinking his birdie putt to clinch the victory and adding to Fleetwood's wait for a PGA Tour win after numerous top-10 finishes. The tournament concluded with Bradley's triumph and Fleetwood's near miss, highlighting the competitive nature of professional golf. The final score reflects a moment of both triumph and disappointment in the world of professional golf.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark experienced a shooting slump in the Indiana Fever's loss to the Las Vegas Aces, going 7-of-20 from the field and 1-of-10 from three-point range. Despite Clark's struggles, Aliyah Boston scored 26 points, and Kelsey Mitchell added 20, but the Aces outscored the Fever 31-20 in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Since a contentious win over Connecticut, Clark's shooting has declined, and the Fever have struggled to win on their West Coast trip. The Fever's schedule continues with a game against the Seattle Storm before they return home.</p>
