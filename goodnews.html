          <p>Top European CEOs are encouraging the continent to capitalize on recent volatility, expressing hope that U.S. exceptionalism is waning and presenting an opportunity for Europe to thrive. Leaders from Unicredit to Goldman Sachs told CNBC that Europe has a significant opportunity, with the Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500 since November 2024. Bank of America reported outflows from U.S. equities and inflows into European stocks, while Goldman Sachs noted the convergence in U.S. and European growth rates as a factor driving investment toward Europe. Despite trade tensions, particularly regarding an EU-U.S. trade deal, optimism remains about Europe's continued revival and its potential to attract capital and innovation.

          <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, announced that it will impose fines starting at ‚Ç¨500 on passengers whose disruptive behavior leads to their removal from a flight. The airline hopes this measure will deter unacceptable behavior onboard its aircraft, as disruptions are often caused by a small number of unruly passengers. Ryanair will also seek civil damages for compensation for costs incurred in more serious cases, and has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be taken directly from the card used to make the booking. The airline has previously called on the European Union to limit the sale of alcohol at airports. This article has a relatively neutral optimism. </p>

Rodgers admits he only knew one song, "We Are Family," would be an instant hit, and expresses gratitude for having creative control over its release. This article has a relatively high optimism. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with a teenage girl with epilepsy, Ava Tharpe, in a ruling that could make it easier for families to sue over access to education. The case involved Tharpe's family claiming that her Minnesota school district did not adequately accommodate her needs, including failing to provide sufficient instruction in the evening when her seizures were less frequent. Lower courts had ruled against the family, requiring them to show "bad faith or gross misjudgment" by school officials. The Supreme Court's decision lowers the legal standard, potentially impacting future disability discrimination claims. This article has a relatively high optimism. </p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common ways to invest in diversified baskets of stocks or bonds, with both actively and passively managed options. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices, while mutual funds are priced at the end of the market day. Investors should review a fund's prospectus for investment objectives, risks, fees, asset composition, and performance history. ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than mutual funds due to lower transaction management costs, and mutual funds often have minimum investment thresholds.
