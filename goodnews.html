          <p>Nadine Dorries, a former Conservative culture secretary and a staunch ally of Boris Johnson, has announced her defection to the Reform UK party. In a statement, she declared the Tory Party is "dead" and that its members must consider the "unthinkable" to secure the country's future. Dorries cited rising crime and the use of hotels for migrants as key reasons for her decision, stating that she believes Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is the only politician with the solutions to these issues. Her move follows several other high-profile defections from the Conservatives, continuing a trend of political realignment on the British right.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has stepped down from his role as executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur after a tenure of almost 25 years. Sources indicate the decision was made by the club's ownership group, who believe a change in leadership is necessary to achieve greater and more consistent sporting success. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and the club's first European trophy in 17 years, but also faced persistent criticism from fans over a perceived lack of on-field investment and success. Peter Charrington will take on the new role of non-executive chairman.</p>

The collaboration is designed to offer private market investment products to a broader range of retail investors, including those with wealth and retirement funds. This move aligns with a recent executive order aimed at increasing access to alternative assets within 401(k) plans, providing a much-needed boost for T. Rowe Price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, elevating its valuation to approximately $10 billion. This figure doubles its previous valuation from January 2024 and positions the firm for a potential initial public offering, which Honeywell executives aim for by 2027. The new funding round saw participation from new investors like Nvidia's venture arm and existing shareholders such as JPMorgan Chase. This development underscores the significant investor confidence in the long-term potential of quantum computing, a technology still in its early stages of commercial application.

The initiative aims to reach up to two million people by 2028, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with high rates of HIV transmission. This move has been widely praised by the global health community as a potential game-changer in the fight to end the HIV epidemic. The financial commitment, made in partnership with the Global Fund and drugmaker Gilead Sciences, signals a renewed focus on prevention after previous foreign aid cuts had severely impacted such programs.</p>

          <p>Sierra, an artificial intelligence startup co-founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, has achieved a $10 billion valuation after securing $350 million in a new funding round. The company specializes in creating AI agents for customer service tasks, which can operate autonomously to assist users. This latest capital injection, led by Greenoaks, more than doubles Sierra's previous valuation and places it among an elite group of AI startups valued at or above the $10 billion mark. The company plans to use the new funds to enhance its platform and pursue both domestic and international expansion.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its long-standing Prime Invitee program, which allowed Prime members to share their free, fast shipping benefits with one other adult living at a different address. Effective October 1, the program will be fully replaced by the Amazon Family program, which restricts the sharing of benefits to individuals residing at the same physical address. This change mirrors the strategy employed by streaming services like Netflix to crack down on account sharing and consolidate user benefits within a single household. For those affected, Amazon is offering a discounted one-year Prime membership to encourage them to sign up for their own accounts.</p>

The dinner follows a recent public falling out between Trump and Musk, though the president recently expressed confidence that Musk would eventually align with the Republican Party. The event underscores the administration's ongoing efforts to cultivate relationships with key leaders in the tech sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill introduced in the Senate, titled the "You Earn It, You Keep it Act," aims to completely eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. The proposal would fund this change by expanding the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000, significantly raising the current cap. This legislation differs from the recently passed Republican tax law, which offers a temporary and limited deduction for seniors rather than a full tax elimination. Proponents argue the bill would provide much-needed relief to retirees and extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund for over two decades.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that found President Trump's country-based tariffs were unlawfully imposed could lead to tens of billions of dollars in refunds for American businesses. The U.S. government has collected over $70 billion from these specific tariffs, which the court deemed were implemented without proper authority. However, the Trump administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, creating ongoing uncertainty for companies that have been paying the levies. If the ruling is upheld, the administration will need to establish a process for businesses to claim their refunds, which could be complex and challenging.</p>

The strong performance of the profitable Expedition provides a bright spot for Ford, whose overall sales grew by a more modest 3.9%.

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are experiencing a powerful, unpleasant odor likened to rotten eggs, which city officials have traced to an invasive Japanese seaweed. Large quantities of the seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, were washed ashore by the rough surf from Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes in the local estuary without a strong tide to wash it away, it releases a potent smell. While concerning to residents, officials have assured the public that the odor is part of a natural decay process and is expected to dissipate over time as the seaweed continues to break down.</p>
