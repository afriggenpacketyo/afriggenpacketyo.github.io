          <p>Electric grills are gaining popularity as a climate-friendly alternative to traditional propane and charcoal grills, with several manufacturers now producing full-size models capable of reaching high temperatures. Consumers are drawn to the convenience and cost-effectiveness of electric grills, as they eliminate the need for propane tanks and offer precise temperature control. Switching to electric grills, powered by increasingly cleaner energy grids, is part of a broader trend toward electrification as a key climate solution. While some chefs remain skeptical, electric grills are suitable for everyday cooking and offer a safer option in areas prone to wildfires.</p>

          <p>Dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, despite facing a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel, returned to the Cannes Film Festival after two decades to present his latest film, "It Was Just an Accident." The movie, shot in secret, confronts state violence and repression, telling the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturers. Panahi's journey to Cannes involved imprisonment and legal battles, yet he remains committed to filmmaking as an act of resistance against censorship and artistic restrictions in Iran, refusing to conform to the Islamic Guidance Ministry's script approval process.</p>

Pinker contends that Harvard, despite its imperfections, remains a valuable institution that contributes significantly to knowledge and innovation, and that the appropriate response is to address specific problems rather than dismantle the university.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Army is set to implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the existing Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards that emphasize combat readiness. The AFT consists of five components, including a three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, particularly for soldiers in combat roles, and the test is designed to improve overall fitness and prepare soldiers for modern warfare. Experts suggest that while challenging, the AFT is achievable with focused training, though estimates vary on how many civilians could pass it.</p>

          <p>NFL contracts are known for their standardized language, but some contain unusual clauses designed to incentivize or control player behavior. Examples include the "homework clause" in Kyler Murray's contract, which mandated film study, and the "Dez Rules," which imposed strict behavioral guidelines on Dez Bryant. Weight clauses are common, with players receiving bonuses for meeting weight targets, while Akili Smith's contract featured performance incentives that he failed to achieve. One of the more unusual clauses stipulated that a player's contract would remain effective until "the end of the world."</p>

          <p>A Cooper's hawk in West Orange, New Jersey, has been observed using a pedestrian crosswalk signal to its advantage, creating a unique hunting strategy. The hawk learned to associate the signal's rhythmic clicking with a buildup of cars, which provided cover for ambushing sparrows and other small birds. This behavior demonstrates the hawk's cognitive abilities, including creating a mental map of the neighborhood and understanding the connection between the traffic signal and its hunting opportunities. The article emphasizes the intelligence and adaptability of animals in human environments.</p>

The First State Animal Center and SPCA cared for the surviving birds after they were found trapped in high temperatures, leading to the death of thousands. Adopters, screened to ensure the chicks would not be used for meat, took them in as egg-laying hens or pets, with the shelter hailing the adoptions as a success and expressing gratitude for the community's support. Donations are still being requested to help the shelter recover from revenue losses and expenses incurred during the rescue.</p>
