          <h2>Millennials Express Concerns About Parenthood Amid Evolving Societal Norms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 10:55:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, noting the record low U.S. fertility rate in 2023. The article suggests that financial burdens, career priorities, climate change anxieties, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade are contributing factors. It also highlights a cultural shift where emotional and relational struggles, previously considered normal, are now labeled as harm or abuse, leading to heightened parenting standards. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing various forms of abuse or feeling unsupported, thus creating an almost impossible standard for parenting, and possibly deterring potential parents. The essay considers these redefined standards and expectations of modern parenthood.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children, now stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine based on shared clinical decision-making between parents and healthcare providers. This update follows an announcement that the agency would no longer broadly recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still broadly recommends the vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults, while guidance for pregnant women is listed as "No Guidance/Not Applicable." This change means health insurance companies will still be required to cover the shots for now, and the CDC deleted a statement that the guidance was recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC, and backed by medical groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania as a deal with Japan's Nippon Steel is being finalized, and this follows Trump's announcement of a "planned partnership" between the two companies. The agreement aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania, with Trump characterizing it as an investment controlled by the United States. Senator David McCormick indicated that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members, with the U.S. retaining a golden share to ensure production levels are maintained. The United Steelworkers union has opposed the sale, while U.S. Steel warned that without an acquisition, it would pivot away from blast furnace facilities, risking jobs.</p>

These enhancements aim to attract more customers to purchase pricier seats, which is crucial for an industry with high costs and thin margins.

          <p>The United States' technology-export restrictions targeting Chinese plane makers are expected to delay China's jet engine indigenization process in the near term, according to analysts. However, this setback is likely to strengthen Beijing's resolve to achieve technological self-reliance and develop a home-grown engine. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has criticized the U.S. engine controls, accusing the U.S. of "maliciously blocking and suppressing China." Analysts anticipate that China will increase resources to develop a domestic jet aircraft engine within the next few years, while Comac may need to slow aircraft production.</p>
