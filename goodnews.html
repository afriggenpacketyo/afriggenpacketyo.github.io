          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad to face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, raising concerns about his fitness. Head coach Thomas Tuchel indicated Saka had limited training during the week, suggesting a link between his omission and physical condition. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, previously missed three months due to a hamstring injury, and his participation in the friendly against Senegal remains uncertain. Conor Gallagher and Ollie Watkins were also left out of the squad, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury, while the reason for Gallagher's exclusion is not yet clear. The Three Lions are currently unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won both of their opening matches against Latvia and Albania.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are actively negotiating a tariff agreement, though they have yet to find common ground on key issues. Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that progress has been made but significant differences remain. Both countries aim to finalize a win-win deal by mid-June, with ongoing coordination to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Japan continues to advocate for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, citing their negative impact on the Japanese economy.</p>

          <p>The UK is hosting the second round of US-China trade talks, a move considered a diplomatic win for the country. The Trump administration approached the UK government to host the talks, which aim to address trade tensions and potential agreements. UK government sources suggest Britain is well-positioned geopolitically to act as a bridge and facilitator in these discussions. This opportunity may also benefit the UK in securing its own trade agreement with the US, potentially reducing or eliminating tariffs.</p>
