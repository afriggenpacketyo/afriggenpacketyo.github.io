          <p>A federal judge awarded over $680,000 to 17 families affected by the 2021 jet fuel leak into a Navy drinking water system in Hawaii. The awards, ranging from $5,000 to over $104,000 per family, serve as bellwether cases for thousands of other pending lawsuits. While the government admitted liability for the spill, they contested the extent of the health impacts. Families reported symptoms like dizziness, rashes, and neurological issues after the fuel contaminated water supplied to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, leading to the eventual draining and closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by George H.W. Bush, passed away at 85, leaving behind a legacy as a key member of the court's liberal wing.

Throughout his tenure, Souter viewed the Constitution as a charter of ‚Äúordered liberty,‚Äù evolving over time to encompass concepts like the right to privacy. Despite his wealth and Ivy League education, Souter maintained an ascetic lifestyle, preferring privacy and intellectual pursuits over Washington's social scene.</p>
