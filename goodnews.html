          <p>Prime Minister Ishigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is projected to experience historically low results in the upcoming Tokyo assembly election, which is viewed as a significant indicator for the July House of Councillors race, as Ishiba navigates leading a minority government amid national political challenges. Tomin First no Kai, established by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, is expected to emerge as the dominant force in the 127-member assembly, propelled by its emphasis on enhancing quality of life. The election results are closely watched for their potential impact on the national political landscape, particularly concerning leadership and economic policy. The number of registered voters stood at approximately 11.55 million for this key election.</p>

          <p>Patrick Schwarzenegger discusses his breakout role as Saxon Ratliff in the latest season of HBO's "The White Lotus," a character he describes as a "chiseled car crash." He initially had reservations about the role, fearing it would be one-dimensional, and was unaware of the extent of the sexual content until later in the audition process. Schwarzenegger, who comes from a famous family, also addresses the issue of nepotism and his desire to forge his own path in acting. He recounts his early exposure to business through managing his father's memorabilia and his parents' influence on his commitment to public service.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski discusses her experiences as a moderate in a polarized Washington in her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C." Murkowski, who came to Washington in 2002 after her father appointed her to his Senate seat, reflects on the challenges she has faced, including being labeled as a product of nepotism. She emphasizes her allegiance to the people of Alaska, rather than the Republican Party, and her commitment to doing what she believes is morally right. Murkowski, who never voted for Donald Trump, also expresses concern about Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher despite the United States entering the war between Israel and Iran and striking three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high on bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict with Tehran would help it to come to an end, despite the Iranian Foreign Minister's insistence that the country could not return to diplomacy "while under attack." Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have all released statements in the last 24 hours, the UAE urged an immediate halt to escalation to "avoid serious repercussions" in the region, while Saudi Arabia expressed concern and Qatar said it "deplored deterioration" in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Reem Raouda, there are five phrases that instantly make children not want to listen, and what to say instead. Traditional parenting phrases such as ‚ÄúBecause I said so‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt listen, you‚Äôll lose [X privilege]‚Äù often trigger a child‚Äôs fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. By shifting to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, cooperation becomes natural. The real secret to getting kids to listen is not about controlling a child's behavior, but creating the conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>
