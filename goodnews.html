          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new interim compensation package valued at approximately $29 billion, structured as 96 million shares. This award is designed to incentivize Musk to remain in a key executive role for at least two more years. The move comes after a Delaware court invalidated his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018, a decision which Tesla is currently appealing. The new award is contingent on the 2018 package not being reinstated, addressing concerns about Musk's focus amid his other ventures and political activities. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, analysis of capital expenditure plans from major tech companies indicates that spending on AI infrastructure is projected to continue its rapid growth into next year.

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle surged over 20% after former President Donald Trump praised its new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign, with the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had drawn criticism from some who called it a sexualized double entendre, but Trump's endorsement shifted the narrative. He lauded the ad as the "HOTTEST out there" on social media, shortly after reports that Sweeney is a registered Republican. The stock rally reversed a recent slump, highlighting the volatile intersection of marketing, celebrity, and political culture in today's consumer landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have finally identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. A new study has pinpointed the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida as the culprit, which causes the sea stars to develop lesions and disintegrate. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star losing 90% of its population, leading to an explosion of sea urchins and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides a crucial step toward potential interventions, such as breeding resistant populations to restore the critical marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay the implementation of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods for six months, providing time to finalize a trade agreement reached with the U.S. in late July. The countermeasures were set to go into effect this week but will now be suspended until at least March. The original agreement included a 15% tariff on most EU goods but is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The pause allows both parties to work on the final details of the deal. (not investment advice)</p>
