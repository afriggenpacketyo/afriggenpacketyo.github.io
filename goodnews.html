          <p>President Trump's focus on celebrating US military victories is analyzed in this article.  The author argues that Trump's perspective lacks historical context and overlooks the contributions of allies in major conflicts.  The article uses World War II as a prime example, highlighting the Soviet Union's significant role and the collaborative nature of the Allied victory.  The author emphasizes the importance of historical accuracy over nationalistic pride.</p>

          <p>A study published in Nature Machine Intelligence suggests that large language models (LLMs) can spontaneously develop human-like cognitive abilities.  Specifically, the research indicates LLMs can create systems for understanding and categorizing natural objects, a key aspect of human cognition.  This finding provides new evidence in the ongoing debate about the cognitive capabilities of AI, suggesting that artificial systems mirroring human thought processes may be achievable.  The study focuses on the potential of LLMs to reflect key aspects of human thinking.</p>

          <p>President Trump approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel, reversing a previous decision by the Biden administration.  This approval is conditional on Nippon Steel's commitment to significant investment in US steel production and job creation.  A national security agreement includes a "golden share" for the US government, granting veto power over key decisions. The deal, creating the world's third-largest steelmaker, is expected to finalize quickly (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco issued an order preventing Secretary of State Marco Rubio from firing State Department employees, citing a previous injunction.  The judge ruled that the Trump administration's plan to reorganize and cut departments violated the injunction.  The State Department had argued that its actions were independent of the president's directive.  The ruling underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding the Trump administration's efforts to restructure government agencies.</p>
