          <p>Following trade talks in Switzerland, the United States and China have agreed to reduce tariff rates, leading to significant changes in duties imposed since April. While headline changes suggest a reduction to at least 30% on Chinese goods to the US and 10% on American exports, these rates do not include previous tariffs from Trump's first term or other duties on specific products. The effective tariff rate for Chinese exporters is estimated to be around 50%, combining previous tariffs and the new duties. The article helps exporters understand the new tariff landscape and its potential impact on Chinese manufacturers and exporters.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, initially impacted by interest rate hikes in 2022, saw profits rise as higher rates boosted net interest income.

However, as interest rates decline, these fintechs, particularly digital banks, face a critical test regarding the sustainability of relying on net interest income. Diversifying revenue streams through services like crypto trading and subscriptions is becoming crucial for fintechs to weather the changing economic environment.
