          <p>U.S. Attorney Alina Habba dropped the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during an ICE facility visit in Newark. Habba cited moving forward as the reason for the dismissal. Simultaneously, Congresswoman LaMonica McIver faces charges for allegedly assaulting and impeding law enforcement during the same visit. Both Baraka and McIver have criticized the ICE facility, alleging dangerous conditions and permit violations, which the Department of Homeland Security denies. The U.S. Attorney has invited Mayor Baraka to tour Delaney Hall to see that the government has nothing to hide.</p>

          <p>A Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Seville flew for approximately 10 minutes without active pilot supervision after the co-pilot became incapacitated and the captain was locked out of the cockpit. The co-pilot's sudden incapacitation, later attributed to an undetected neurological condition, occurred while the captain was using the restroom. During the period of pilot absence, the autopilot system maintained the flight's trajectory, correcting minor deviations caused by the co-pilot's accidental contact with the controls. The captain eventually regained access to the cockpit, and the flight was safely diverted to Madrid where the co-pilot received medical attention.</p>

          <p>A divided appeals court ruled in favor of a Venezuelan man seeking to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, finding that his removal violated a class-action settlement. The man, identified as "Cristian," was deported under the Alien Enemies Act, which the court deemed a breach of the settlement agreement. The government argued that Cristian was an admitted gang member and had a felony drug conviction, but the court found the evidence presented was insufficient.</p>
