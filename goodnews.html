          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to the challenges posed by streaming services and high ticket prices by fostering community and creating unique experiences. The article highlights several examples, including a theater owned by filmmaker Kevin Smith that operates as a non-profit, and Vidiots in Los Angeles, which combines a theater with an extensive video store. These venues emphasize a return to a social movie-going experience, hosting special events and building a local following. While some, like New York's Metrograph, succeed as for-profit businesses by offering premium amenities, all share a common goal of preserving the communal magic of cinema for new audiences.</p>

The game, which was the longest winner-take-all contest in MLB history, ended with a bases-loaded single by Jorge Polanco. Both teams' pitching staffs were stretched to their limits, with starters from both sides being used in relief roles during the extended extra innings.

          <p>The Plaid Cymru party in Wales has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers up to £30,000 in incentive payments if they win the next Senedd election. The proposal aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by making Welsh teaching positions more competitive with those in England. The payments would target priority subjects like math and science, as well as Welsh-medium teaching, and would require recipients to work in Wales for five years after qualifying. The party estimates the policy would cost £6-£7 million, funded from money already designated for curriculum support, as part of a broader plan to raise educational standards.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the universal human experience of regret, framing it not as something to be avoided but as an emotion that can be used for personal growth. It posits that regret is an inherent consequence of having free will; without the ability to make choices, there would be no mistakes to regret. Rather than getting stuck in a cycle of 'what ifs' about the past, the article suggests that embracing feelings of disappointment or sadness can lead to valuable self-discovery in the present. By learning from past decisions, individuals can better understand their current values and make more informed choices in the future.</p>

          <p>The race to become the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is shaping up to be a critical moment for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The two main candidates, Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson, represent different approaches to the role, with Powell positioning herself as a critical voice willing to challenge the leadership and Phillipson as a loyal insider. With many party members reportedly disgruntled with Starmer's leadership and the party's poor polling, the election of Powell, who was recently sacked from the cabinet, could be interpreted as a rebuke of the current leadership's direction and a sign of internal party frustration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world is projected to produce a record amount of grain this year, a testament to decades of agricultural advancements that have made devastating famines increasingly rare. Innovations like high-yield seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and widespread irrigation have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s, creating a global food system of abundance. However, the article notes that hunger persists due to human failures, not crop failures. Current crises in Gaza and Sudan are caused by political conflict blocking food access, while climate change and trade restrictions pose future threats to this progress against widespread starvation.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old woman, survived a rare and often fatal childbirth complication known as an amniotic fluid embolism, which caused her heart to stop during labor. The condition occurs when amniotic fluid enters the mother's bloodstream, triggering a catastrophic shutdown of major organs. Thanks to the quick actions of her medical team, Choate was resuscitated, and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. After nine days in intensive care, she was discharged without long-term medical complications, a fortunate outcome for a condition with a high mortality rate for both mother and baby.</p>
