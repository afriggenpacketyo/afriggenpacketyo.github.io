          <p>A minor 3.0 magnitude earthquake struck the New York City metropolitan area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the tremor was felt across the region, including in parts of New York City and as far as Connecticut, it was relatively minor and caused no reported injuries or structural damage. Officials from New York City Emergency Management confirmed the lack of impact, reassuring the public. This event comes after a much more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled the same area in April 2024, though U.S. Geological Survey analysts emphasized that Saturday's quake was not a cause for significant alarm.</p>

          <p>A decade after the Zika virus outbreak swept through Brazil, families of the nearly 2,000 children born with congenital Zika syndrome continue to face profound challenges as their children's health conditions often worsen with age. This article highlights a group of mothers in Maceió, the outbreak's epicenter, who have created a powerful support network to navigate their shared struggles. Many of these women, often single parents living on minimal state benefits, successfully organized to live in the same housing complex to help one another. Their collective advocacy recently achieved a major victory, overturning a presidential veto to secure significantly higher, lifelong compensation for their children's care.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC One series, titled "Parenthood," delves into the extraordinary and often sacrificial efforts of parents across the animal kingdom to raise their young. The series showcases remarkable behaviors, such as African social spider mothers being consumed by their own offspring in an ultimate act of devotion known as matriphagy. According to director Jeff Wilson, the show connects these animal stories to universal human themes of parenting, dedication, and adapting to an uncertain future. At 99 years old, Attenborough's narration continues to bring these compelling natural dramas to life, from orangutans engaged in decade-long teaching to poison dart frogs undertaking perilous journeys for their tadpoles.</p>

          <p>More than twenty years after its initial release, the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" is being celebrated for its lasting cultural significance, particularly among South Asian women who faced family and cultural opposition to playing sports. The article shares the stories of women who felt seen and heard by the film's protagonist, Jesminder Bhamra, as she navigates her passion for football against her parents' traditional expectations. The movie's themes of cultural identity, female ambition, and generational divides remain highly relevant today, solidifying its legacy as a source of inspiration and positive representation. With a sequel now reportedly in development, the film's impact continues to be felt across generations.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released after spending two months in an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. She was detained in May during what she and her husband believed was a routine green card interview, just nine weeks after giving birth to their second child. Her detention was based on an old deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother missed an immigration hearing years ago. Her case drew attention to the administration's stringent enforcement priorities, which can impact military families, but she was ultimately released on a recognizance bond to be reunited with her husband and young children.</p>

          <p>The United States swimming team delivered a record-breaking performance at the 2025 World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, setting a new world record in the 4x100 mixed relay with a time of 3:18.48. The relay gold was a highlight of a dominant night for the Americans, who won three gold medals in total. Legendary swimmer Katie Ledecky also added to her legacy by winning the 800-meter freestyle, maintaining her undefeated streak in that event at major international competitions since 2012. Additionally, Gretchen Walsh secured her second individual gold of the championships by winning the 50-meter butterfly, marking a major turnaround for the team.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have detained a member of parliament and several other officials as part of a major investigation into a bribery scheme related to military drone procurement. The officials are accused of being involved in signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30 percent. President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the agencies and reaffirmed a "zero tolerance" policy towards corruption. These arrests are particularly significant as they follow recent nationwide protests that successfully restored the independence of these anti-corruption bodies, a key requirement in Ukraine's ongoing bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a radical, experimental project into a foundational pillar of the global financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially designed to enable "programmable money," Ethereum's network now serves as the backbone for the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, NFTs, and a growing number of institutional applications. Major firms like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are actively building on its platform to issue tokenized funds and other real-world assets. As it enters its next decade, founder Vitalik Buterin and others are focused on scaling the network without compromising its core principles of decentralization and security.
