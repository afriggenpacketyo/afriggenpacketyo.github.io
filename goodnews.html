          <p>The White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has released its first report identifying key drivers of childhood chronic disease. The report focuses on poor diet, cumulative chemical exposure, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and "overmedicalization." While some current and former federal health officials have criticized the report for misrepresenting facts and omitting other known drivers, the report suggests a shift towards preventative measures and addressing corporate influence in federal policymaking. The report also touches on concerns about pesticides, medications, and vaccines.</p>

          <p>David Falk, Michael Jordan's longtime agent, has reignited the debate over the NBA's greatest player of all time, asserting that Jordan is superior to LeBron James. Falk stated that if Jordan had the opportunity to pick teams and play with other superstars, he would have won 15 championships. He places Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Kobe Bryant as the next-best players after Jordan, and believes James would be in his top ten. Falk's comment references James' decision to join the Miami Heat and form the "Big 3" with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold surging to record highs, investors should be aware of common misconceptions surrounding the precious metal. One myth is that gold's price always rises, but prices can experience short-term dips. Another myth is that inflation always causes gold's price to rise, but gold prices can increase even when inflation declines. Lastly, it's not always worth waiting for gold's price to fall before investing, as prices tend to rise over time. (not investment advice)</p>

The Navy initially used its own terms, which identified a larger number of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi.
