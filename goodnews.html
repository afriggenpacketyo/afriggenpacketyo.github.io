          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure provider for AI, increased by nearly 8% following the disclosure of a major agreement with Nvidia. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase at least $6.3 billion of CoreWeave's unsold computing capacity through April 2032, highlighting the strong partnership between the two companies. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, heavily relies on Nvidia's GPUs to serve its clients, including major tech firms like Google and Microsoft. This agreement follows another significant contract for CoreWeave with OpenAI, valued at $11.9 billion over five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market is approaching new record highs, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showing significant gains. The rally is partly driven by strong performances from major tech companies, including a 2.8% rise in Tesla's stock after Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares. Additionally, Alphabet's market value surpassed $3 trillion, joining a small group of companies at that level. Investors are now closely watching for the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, which is widely expected to be the first cut of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the window for savers to lock in high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs) may be closing. This article analyzes the potential interest earnings on a $15,000 CD across various terms, from three months to three years, with current rates yielding returns from over $150 to more than $1,800. CDs offer a guaranteed, fixed interest rate, providing security against market volatility and declining rates on variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings. However, savers must be prepared to keep their funds deposited for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that Washington and Beijing have reached a "framework" agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. The deal, which aims to address national security concerns, is expected to be finalized in a conversation between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes as a deadline looms for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American division or face a ban in the United States. While details are sparse, the agreement was reportedly reached during trade talks in Madrid, paving the way for continued access for the app's 170 million U.S. users.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Savings Strategies Ahead of Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 15:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut considered almost certain, savers are advised to strategically place their funds to maximize returns before rates fall further. Instead of keeping money in traditional low-yield savings accounts, experts suggest moving funds to higher-earning options. A certificate of deposit (CD) can lock in current high rates for a fixed term, protecting against future declines. High-yield savings and money market accounts still offer competitive, albeit variable, rates while providing greater liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds compared to CDs, making them suitable alternatives for many savers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, and experts warn that recent tax changes enacted by the Trump administration could complicate calculations for some filers. The new law introduced several tax breaks for 2025, which might cause taxpayers with fixed paycheck withholdings to overpay if they don't adjust their quarterly estimates. These payments are typically required for income not subject to withholding, such as from self-employment or investments. Tax professionals advise filers to potentially run new projections to ensure they are paying the correct amount for the third and fourth quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a more than 2% increase after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020. Musk acquired approximately $1 billion worth of stock, a move widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer. This significant insider purchase comes as Tesla's stock had been slightly down for the year, facing challenges from slumping sales and the end of certain EV incentives. The move is seen by some analysts as Musk reinforcing his commitment to Tesla's future in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which have been on a gradual downward trend for much of 2025, could see another drop this week. The decline is anticipated in connection with the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, where a cut in the federal funds rate is widely expected. Lenders may preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, potentially pushing the average below the recent 11-month low. While this is positive news for homebuyers, the article cautions that the market remains unpredictable and advises borrowers to have a good credit score to qualify for the best available rates.

          <p>A tropical disturbance in the Atlantic, designated Invest 92L, has a 90% chance of developing into a tropical depression or storm within the next week. If it strengthens to have winds of at least 39 mph, it will be named Tropical Storm Gabrielle. Current spaghetti models and forecasts suggest that a dip in the jet stream will likely steer the system northward into the Atlantic, away from the Caribbean and the U.S. mainland. However, forecasters note that predictions for undeveloped storms carry uncertainty, and residents in Bermuda are advised to monitor its progress closely.</p>

          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the most cost-competitive forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, which shows that renewables are cheaper to generate than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. However, the true cost is complex, influenced by factors such as tax incentives, tariffs, and the need for backup power sources for intermittent renewables. President Trump's policies are expected to increase costs for renewable projects while providing new tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Article Outlines Seven Strategic Methods for Accessing Funds from an Annuity</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees needing access to funds tied up in an annuity, there are several strategic options available, though each comes with trade-offs. The simplest method is to wait for scheduled payments to begin, but for more immediate needs, many contracts allow for partial withdrawals of up to 10% annually without surrender fees. Other strategies include taking a loan against the annuity's value, surrendering the contract for its cash value despite high fees, or using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a more favorable contract. Some annuities also have hardship provisions for specific situations like terminal illness. (not investment advice)</p>
