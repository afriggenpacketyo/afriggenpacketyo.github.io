          <p>Sony has projected a 12.9% decrease in net profit for the fiscal year 2025, estimating it to be around 930 billion yen. The announcement, made public on Tuesday, signals potential shifts in the company's financial performance. While the exact reasons for this anticipated decline were not provided in the article, it suggests that Sony is bracing for a less profitable year than the last, which could be attributed to various market factors or internal restructuring. The company is likely to provide more detailed explanations in their official financial reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole. The resentencing came after emotional statements from the brothers, who acknowledged their actions and apologized to their family, with the Los Angeles judge noting the work the brothers have done to better the lives of inmates, including a hospice program for the elderly and sick. Family members testified in support of their release, detailing the brothers' rehabilitation and remorse, and their cousin said the family wanted a judge to give the brothers a lesser sentence than life without parole for the 1989 murders. District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, arguing the brothers hadn't shown enough insight into their crimes.</p>

          <p>Roki Sasaki, the Los Angeles Dodgers' highly anticipated rookie pitcher from Japan, has been placed on the 15-day injured list due to a right shoulder impingement. Manager Dave Roberts revealed that Sasaki had been experiencing arm soreness since his previous start, which was his first time pitching with only five days of rest, one day less than his usual schedule. This injury follows a noticeable dip in Sasaki's velocity and a less-than-stellar performance against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Sasaki's arrival to the Dodgers was highly anticipated after a successful career with the Lotte Marines in Japan.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has announced the reinstatement of Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. The league's policy on permanent ineligibility has been changed, with bans expiring upon death, and Rose's reinstatement comes months after his passing. However, the Hall of Fame's rules also consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game," potentially complicating their chances of induction.</p>
