          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, underwent an MRI that revealed a second chordoma on her spine. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a novel surgical plan, approaching the spinal tumor through Flores' eye, a procedure he called the "third nostril" approach. The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor, which was then successfully removed. Flores underwent radiation and rehabilitative therapy and is now cancer-free, and Labib hopes this technique can be used for other difficult-to-reach tumors. </p>

Wang suggests that China's recent technological advancements have primarily originated from companies rather than university laboratories, challenging the traditional academic focus.

          <p>A reported carjacking in Madera County, California, was discovered to be an insurance fraud scheme orchestrated by Martha Gutierrez DeRomero and her boyfriend, Alfredo Ledezma. DeRomero initially claimed two masked men stole her van containing $60,000 worth of fitness merchandise, but her story unraveled after multiple interviews with investigators. Authorities located the abandoned van and a storage locker with the stolen merchandise, leading to charges of insurance fraud and filing a false police report against DeRomero and Ledezma. The sheriff emphasized the seriousness of exploiting emergency services for personal gain, diverting resources from those genuinely in need. </p>

          <h2>California Reviews Parole Denials Due to Faulty Drug Tests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings to determine if faulty drug tests contributed to inmate denials. Nearly 6,000 drug tests are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July of the previous year. Attorneys are reviewing inmate files to identify cases where a new parole hearing may be warranted. The review aims to ensure fair parole decisions, as faulty test results could have unfairly influenced the parole board. </p>
