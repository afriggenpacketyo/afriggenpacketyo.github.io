          <p>South Africa secured a 14-run victory over England in the first T20 match of their series, which was significantly affected by rain in Cardiff. The game was initially reduced to nine overs per side, with South Africa setting a strong pace before another rain delay. England's target was then revised to 69 runs in just five overs, a challenging chase they ultimately fell short of, finishing at 54-5. The series will continue at Old Trafford, with weather forecasts again predicting rain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school for the time being. The decision lets a federal appeals court ruling stand while the student's lawsuit against a state ban proceeds. The state's policy ties school funding to compliance with a rule that prohibits transgender students from using facilities aligning with their gender identity. While not a ruling on the merits of the case, the order allows the student to maintain access to the appropriate facilities as the legal battle over Title IX and equal protection continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its long-standing policy and will now provide N95 masks to federal firefighters to protect them from smoke inhalation. For decades, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, despite other countries providing them and growing evidence of health risks like cancer. The policy change follows media reports and pressure from lawmakers who criticized the agency for neglecting firefighter health. This move aligns federal practice with that of many local fire departments and is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the serious health hazards posed by wildfire smoke.</p>

The former "Match of the Day" host, who left the BBC football show in May, accepted the publicly voted award by acknowledging its significance. He suggested the win demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for important issues. The ceremony also saw the popular sitcom "Gavin and Stacey" win in the comedy category for its Christmas finale.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison momentarily became the world's wealthiest individual, with his net worth surging to $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk. The shift was driven by a more than 40% jump in Oracle's stock price, fueled by strong demand for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence services. Although Musk reclaimed the top spot by the end of the trading day, the event highlights Oracle's significant growth in the AI sector. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Trump, has also been involved in potential acquisitions of companies like TikTok and Paramount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has finally shared her thoughts on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada." Wintour, widely believed to be the inspiration for Meryl Streep's demanding character Miranda Priestly, called the movie a "fair shot" with "a lot of humor to it." She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, unaware of the film's plot, but was ultimately impressed by the cast and Streep's fantastic performance. The comments come as a sequel to the film is in production, slated for a 2026 release.</p>

          <h2>Oracle Shares Experience Historic Surge, Adding $244 Billion in Market Value</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock saw a historic 36% gain, its best single-day performance since 1992, adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. The massive surge was driven by the company's announcement of an astounding $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This growth is attributed to soaring demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is essential for running artificial intelligence workloads. The report overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue, cementing Oracle's position as a major player in the competitive AI and cloud computing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that its Perseverance rover has collected a rock sample from Mars's Jezero Crater that contains "potential biosignatures." The sample, taken from an ancient river valley, exhibits mineral patterns and textures that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While scientists cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, they describe it as the closest they have come to discovering evidence of past life on the red planet. The agency is now focused on developing a mission to return this and other samples to Earth for more detailed analysis, a crucial next step in answering profound questions about extraterrestrial life.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is petitioning against FIFA's use of "dynamic pricing" for the 2026 World Cup, arguing the practice puts profits before fans. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, claims the pricing model will make attending games unaffordable for many and negatively impact the atmosphere. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a 15% ticket allocation for local residents, and a cap on resale prices on FIFA's official platform. He stated that the governing body's current approach is an "affront to the game" and a departure from past, more accessible tournaments.</p>

          <p>A planned weekend strike that would have affected dozens of bus routes in London has been mostly averted. The Unite union announced that the majority of workers, employed by London United, accepted a new pay offer and cancelled their walkout. The dispute over pay and conditions involved drivers, engineers, and controllers across north-west and south-west London. However, some industrial action may still proceed if negotiations between the union and a smaller operator, London Transit, do not reach an agreement, potentially affecting a handful of routes.</p>
