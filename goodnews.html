          <p>President Trump issued an executive order designating any armed attack on Qatar as a direct threat to U.S. national security, committing to all lawful measures, including potential military intervention, to defend Qatari and American interests. This move came in response to an Israeli missile strike on Qatar's capital, Doha, on September 9th, which Israel stated targeted Hamas leaders but unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman and violated Qatari sovereignty. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu later apologized for the incident, affirming no future attacks. Qatar, a crucial U.S. ally hosting the largest American military base in the Middle East, saw this order strengthen its security relationship with the United States amidst regional instability and ongoing Gaza ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>A boiler room explosion led to a partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, creating a significant hole in its structure and showering debris onto surrounding areas. Despite the dramatic damage, authorities reported no injuries or fatalities, which Mayor Eric Adams described as extremely fortunate given the potential for a major disaster. Initial findings point to the explosion originating in the boiler room, with shockwaves traveling up the chimney. Residents from 38 apartments were evacuated, and gas services were shut off for the complex as inspections commenced. City records indicate the building had active violations for unsafe facades dating back to 2020.</p>

          <p>Jane Goodall, the celebrated conservationist and ethologist who profoundly reshaped the world's understanding of chimpanzees, passed away at 91 from natural causes while on a speaking tour in California. Goodall's pioneering research in Tanzania during the 1960s led to the groundbreaking discovery that chimpanzees use and craft tools, a revelation that redefined the scientific community's view of human-animal distinctions. She established the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, which continues to lead efforts in chimpanzee protection and habitat conservation, alongside its global youth program, Roots & Shoots. A tireless advocate, Goodall spent her final decades traveling the world, emphasizing the urgent need for environmental protection and warning against humanity's impact on the planet.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are largely expected to open higher on Thursday, mirroring gains seen on Wall Street, as investors project the U.S. government shutdown will be brief. Although the shutdown could extend for nearly two weeks due to the Senate's observance of Yom Kippur, market sentiment indicates a belief in minimal prolonged economic disruption. Japan's Nikkei 225 index futures point to a higher open, and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 is also set for gains. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index futures suggest a lower opening. In economic news, South Korea's consumer price index rose 2.1% year-on-year in September, surpassing economists' forecasts and reflecting inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professor Nita Forouhi, a leading expert in Population Health and Nutrition at the University of Cambridge, addresses and debunks several pervasive myths surrounding cooking oils and healthy fats. She asserts that no single oil provides a universal health solution, and that understanding fat types is crucial. Forouhi clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils are indeed beneficial, containing low saturated fats and high healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, which can help lower bad cholesterol when used as alternatives to butter or lard. She also highlights that modern margarines, now virtually free of harmful trans fats, can be part of a healthy diet. Finally, while extra virgin olive oil is ideal for dressings, she recommends basic olive oil, vegetable, or sunflower oil for frying due to their higher smoke points.</p>
