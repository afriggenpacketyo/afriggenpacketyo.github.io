          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Protecting Dogs During Extreme Heat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Animal welfare experts are issuing urgent warnings to dog owners about the dangers of exercising their pets in hot weather, as dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Unlike humans, dogs have a limited ability to cool down and can quickly overheat, with signs including heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. The article advises against walking dogs in high temperatures, suggesting instead indoor play and walks during the coolest parts of the day, such as early morning or late evening. It also provides a simple test: if the pavement is too hot to comfortably hold the back of your hand on it, it is too hot for a dog's paws.</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated boxing rematch between British fighters Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn has been scheduled for September 20 in London. The fight follows their thrilling bout in April, which Eubank Jr won by unanimous decision, a contest that drew massive attention due to the historic rivalry between their famous fathers, Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn. The build-up to their first fight was marked by controversy, including a cancellation in 2022 after Benn failed a drug test and a chaotic pre-fight press conference. This second meeting promises to continue the intense family legacy, though a specific venue has not yet been confirmed.</p>

          <p>The racing drama "F1 The Movie," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's first major box office success, debuting with an impressive $55.6 million in the U.S. and Canada. Directed by Joseph Kosinski of "Top Gun: Maverick" fame, the film exceeded expectations and brought in an additional $88 million internationally, driven by the global popularity of Formula One. Despite its strong opening and positive reviews, the movie's high production budget of over $200 million means it still has a long road to profitability. The success marks a significant milestone for Apple, whose previous high-profile film projects have struggled to make a significant impact in theaters.</p>

A softening but not collapsing labor market has been indicated by rising continuing unemployment claims.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that the changes, which include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only, have put them in a better position to pass the legislation. The U-turn was forced by widespread concern that the original plans to save ¬£5bn annually would harm vulnerable and disabled people. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now likely support the bill, averting a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>
