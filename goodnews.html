          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from proceeding with mass layoffs and a major agency overhaul. The ruling found "no rational basis" for the administration's plan, which critics warned could have devastating consequences for public health services nationwide. The lawsuit was initiated by 19 Democratic attorneys general who argued the restructuring would paralyze the agency. This decision temporarily halts the plan to lay off approximately 10,000 employees and create a new agency, pending further legal review.</p>

The band, known for its DIY ethic, rallied around her, highlighting their strong sense of sisterhood.

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of food inflation, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had placed on eggs. The restaurant chain implemented the extra charge in February due to record-high egg prices caused by a widespread avian flu outbreak. With wholesale and retail prices now beginning to stabilize, the popular diner, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually, announced the end of the temporary fee. The move reflects a broader, albeit slow, easing of food price pressures across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates near record highs, debt forgiveness programs that can reduce balances by 30% to 50% are an attractive option for consumers facing financial hardship. However, this solution is not universally suitable, as it requires a significant minimum debt and can negatively impact one's credit score. This article suggests that while immediate action is better than waiting for interest rates to fall, individuals should also explore alternatives like debt management plans or consolidation loans. Ultimately, the best course of action depends on a person's specific financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The spending package passed by Senate Republicans includes an expansion of the child tax credit, a move that could benefit many American families. The bill proposes to permanently raise the maximum credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and index it to inflation, differing from the House version's temporary increase to $2,500. However, policy experts note that the proposed changes would not benefit the lowest-income families, as an estimated 17 million children are in households that do not earn enough to qualify for the full credit. The legislation now moves to the House for further consideration.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China and was projected to cost the industry billions. Following its removal, shares of major renewable energy companies like NextEra Energy and AES rose, and the Invesco Solar ETF jumped 4%. While industry groups welcomed the change, they cautioned that the overall legislation still contains provisions that could harm the renewable energy sector's growth.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), to expedite housing construction and address the state's affordability crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the new rules, which exempt most infill housing projects in urban areas from the stringent environmental reviews that critics say have long hampered development. The changes, passed as part of the state budget, also include exemptions for high-tech manufacturing sites. While supporters hail it as a crucial step, some environmental and social justice groups have opposed the move, fearing it undermines public protections.</p>

          <p>According to NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch, there is one crucial question that job seekers should ask at the end of an interview to uncover a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often catches managers off guard, leading to more honest and revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture. The responses can provide valuable insight into a company's real expectations regarding work-life balance, collaboration, and social dynamics. This strategy helps candidates assess whether a company's values align with their own, leading to better job satisfaction and retention.</p>
