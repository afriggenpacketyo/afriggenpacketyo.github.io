          <h2>British Plane Parts May Be Exempted from US Tariffs Amid Trade Deal Progress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 07:45:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of ongoing trade negotiations, British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, may be exempted from US import tariffs. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that such an exemption is part of the "economic prosperity deal" with the UK, although the details are still being finalized. The deal would provide certainty to the UK's ¬£40bn aerospace sector and would also benefit US companies like Boeing, which imports Rolls-Royce engines. The agreement also aims to reduce car tariffs and eliminate steel tariffs, potentially preventing job losses in related industries.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article delves into the significant influence siblings have on each other's personalities and lives, often more than parents realize. The article references a new book, "The Family Dynamic," which explores how sibling relationships, even in disadvantaged families, can shape career paths and academic achievements. Research suggests that the "sibling spillover effect" is more powerful in families with fewer resources. While birth order psychology is often dismissed, the article highlights the cognitive edge enjoyed by first-born children, while younger siblings may gravitate towards sports to carve out their own niche.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar for use as Air Force One. The plane, valued at approximately $400 million, would be transferred to the US Air Force for modifications before being handed over to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice purportedly conclude that the arrangement is legal and does not violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause. The move comes amid delays and cost overruns in the existing Air Force One replacement program.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to end care worker recruitment from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration in the UK. The government aims to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers coming to the UK over the next year by requiring firms to hire domestically or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. While targets for net migration will not be set, changes to skilled and care worker visas are expected to be implemented throughout the year. The government also plans to introduce a new fair pay agreement for care workers to attract more domestic workers.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, John Cameron Mitchell reflects on his college speaking tour and the need for young people to embrace a punk ethos. He argues that today's students, facing a potential post-democratic America, require new skills to confront societal challenges. Mitchell suggests that D.I.Y. collective action, specifically of the punk variety, might be the best path forward. He encourages students to stop canceling each other, learn about punk, and create useful stories outside approved systems, emphasizing community, empathy, and embracing the analog.</p>

          <p>Dartmouth College President Sian Beilock's approach to campus politics has kept her institution off the Trump administration's target list, unlike many of its Ivy League peers. While other universities face funding threats and investigations, Dartmouth's funding remains intact, and it is not under investigation. Beilock's supporters cite her commitment to free expression and dialogue, while critics accuse her of trying to appease conservatives. Her actions, including a police crackdown on a pro-Palestinian protest and the hiring of a former Republican official, have divided the campus.</p>
