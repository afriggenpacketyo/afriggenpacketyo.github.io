          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the stock market, even if it appears frothy, arguing that the current environment is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble. He stated that today's market has more rational factors, such as strong performances from companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly, which overwhelm the irrational speculation seen in some recent IPOs. Cramer suggested that while there is some irrationality, the legitimate growth in solid companies provides a stable foundation for continued investment. He believes the runs in good stocks can't happen without some speculation in others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined an emergency request to block a Mississippi law requiring parental consent for minors to use popular social media platforms. The tech industry group NetChoice had challenged the law, arguing it violates First Amendment free speech protections. While the law can now be enforced, the case will continue in lower courts and is expected to return to the Supreme Court for full consideration. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, suggested the law is likely unconstitutional but agreed that NetChoice did not meet the high standard required for emergency relief at this stage.</p>

          <p>Brentford has agreed to a club-record deal worth up to £42.5 million to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London after expressing a desire to leave Bournemouth due to a lack of a prominent role. Ouattara had a successful season with the Cherries, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances across all competitions. This move comes after Brentford's previous bid for another player was rejected, and after Nottingham Forest, another interested party in Ouattara, pursued a different target.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic growth slows and spending in major Chinese cities tightens, the country's smaller, lower-tier counties are emerging as a new engine for consumption. Residents in these areas often have lighter economic burdens, faster income growth, and greater confidence, leading to stronger purchasing power. This expanding middle class is fueling a consumption upgrade, purchasing items like Teslas and imported goods through robust e-commerce networks. Experts believe the consumption potential in these previously overlooked markets is largely untapped, offering a path for China to shift its economy toward a more consumption-driven model.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has invalidated two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI initiatives. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers, which argued the government's guidance created a chilling effect on free speech. The judge found the administration's memos initiated a "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedures, effectively blocking a key part of its campaign against what it terms "race-based decision-making."</p>

          <p>While the consumer launch of OpenAI's GPT-5 was met with criticism, the new AI model is finding significant success in the lucrative enterprise market, challenging rival Anthropic. Startups and companies like Box are adopting GPT-5 for its improved performance on complex tasks, faster setup, and lower cost compared to competing models. OpenAI has been building a dedicated enterprise sales team to capitalize on this momentum, aiming to secure long-term business customers. This strategic push into the enterprise sector is crucial for both OpenAI and Anthropic as they compete for market dominance and face high operational costs.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats who left the state to prevent Republicans from passing a new, GOP-favorable congressional map. Obama praised their efforts, framing their actions as part of a larger fight to protect fair elections against partisan gerrymandering. He was joined by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. The Texas Democrats stated that Obama's support demonstrates that their protest has backing from the party at every level, and they remain committed to blocking what they call a "racial gerrymandering scheme."</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing has revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth during the last quarter. The conglomerate purchased over 5 million shares, valued at approximately $1.6 billion, making it a significant position in Berkshire's portfolio. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a withdrawn earnings outlook, which caused its stock to fall nearly 50% this year. The news of Berkshire's investment caused UnitedHealth's shares to rise 6% in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Since its public debut in 2020, AI software company Palantir has experienced a surge of over 1,700%, reaching a market valuation past $430 billion. A key driver of this growth has been substantial government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its total revenue last quarter. The company's stock has also been bolstered by strong interest from retail investors, who poured $1.2 billion into the stock last month. Despite its high valuation, Palantir's revenue remains a fraction of that of its megacap tech peers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, retirees are increasingly considering annuities to create guaranteed income streams, raising the question of whether owning multiple annuities is a wise strategy. It is possible to own several annuities to diversify and leverage different features, such as combining a fixed annuity for stable income with a variable one for growth potential. However, this approach increases complexity, fees, and paperwork. Prospective retirees must carefully coordinate liquidity, manage varied tax implications, and weigh the benefits of diversification against the added administrative burden.

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending more aggressive and earlier treatment. Under the new advice, individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should first adopt lifestyle changes; if those are ineffective after three to six months, medication is recommended. A significant change from the 2017 guidelines is the new recommendation to abstain from alcohol, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of blood pressure control in reducing the risk of dementia.</p>

With economists predicting potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, prospective borrowers face a choice. Those considering a variable-rate HELOC may not need to wait, as future rate cuts would apply automatically, while those seeking a fixed-rate home equity loan might benefit from waiting for a potentially lower rate.
