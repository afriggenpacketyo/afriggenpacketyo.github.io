          <p>Chinese chip firm Sophgo announced its SC11 FP300 compute card has been successfully verified to run DeepSeek's domestic AI models. This verification, conducted by a state-affiliated lab, marks a key step in China's push for technological self-reliance in its AI infrastructure. The company highlighted that the card's advanced features, including 256 gigabytes of high-bandwidth memory, enable faster performance for AI training and execution. This development aligns with Beijing's strategic goal of supporting its leading AI systems with homegrown hardware technology.</p>

          <p>Moderna reported that its experimental mRNA flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results clear a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination flu-and-Covid shot. The company plans to file for approval later this year, with hopes of launching the products in 2026, which could simplify vaccinations and reduce healthcare system workloads. This development comes as the company navigates an uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.</p>

          <p>Tropical Depression Barry has dissipated after making landfall on Mexico's east coast, though it is still expected to bring several days of heavy rain to the region. The system, which briefly reached tropical storm status, was the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters had issued a tropical storm warning, anticipating three to six inches of rain across the states of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas. While the storm weakened upon hitting the coast, the threat of flooding remains a concern for the affected areas.</p>

          <p>UEFA has postponed its decision on whether Crystal Palace can compete in the Europa League next season, pending the outcome of an appeal by French club Lyon. Crystal Palace's spot is at risk due to multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in Lyon. However, Lyon was recently demoted to Ligue 2 over financial issues and has agreed to relinquish its Europa League spot if its appeal fails. To resolve the conflict, Textor is in the process of selling his stake in Crystal Palace to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson.</p>

The study, published in Nature Aging, also found that the diabetes medication metformin could potentially slow the progression of this hearing loss in monkeys. These findings could pave the way for new, personalized treatments for a condition that affects many older adults. The authors state their work provides a foundation for developing novel therapies and a deeper understanding of the aging process in the auditory system.</p>

          <p>After decades of research, several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink, Precision Neuroscience, and Synchron, are close to commercializing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for people with paralysis. These surgically implanted devices can decode brain signals, allowing users to control computers, move prosthetic limbs, or generate speech using only their thoughts. The first products will likely enable users to operate a computer cursor or smartphone, significantly improving their quality of life and potential for employment.

          <p>Interior designers suggest that bathrooms, often neglected spaces for decor, can be significantly enhanced with the right artwork. The key is to treat the bathroom like any other room in the home, avoiding clich√©d "potty humor" and instead choosing pieces that add a focal point and personality. Designers recommend a broad approach, from elegant paintings and personal photos to whimsical prints and even children's art. While moisture is a concern for valuable pieces, well-ventilated spaces can accommodate a variety of art, which can be hung on walls or propped on vanities to elevate the room's aesthetic.</p>

The author argues that societal pressures, non-standard work hours, and the digital world make achieving adequate sleep difficult for many, and that individual blame is often misplaced. The piece questions the rigid "eight-hour" rule and the effectiveness of simple sleep hygiene tips for those with chronic insomnia. It also examines the nuances of treatments like CBT-I and the stigma surrounding sleep medications, calling for a more compassionate and less moralizing public conversation.</p>

He replaces Wales' Tomos Williams, who sustained a hamstring injury during a match against Western Force in Australia. White expressed his shock and honor at the unexpected opportunity to join the prestigious touring squad, a dream for any rugby player in the home nations.</p>

          <p>As it marks its 20th anniversary, Reddit is fighting to protect its vast repository of user-generated conversations from being freely used by AI companies. The company is suing AI startup Anthropic for allegedly scraping its data unlawfully, arguing that commercial use of its content requires a commercial agreement. Simultaneously, Reddit is embracing AI on its own terms, launching "Reddit Answers," a chatbot that provides responses based solely on its platform's discussions. This dual strategy aims to defend its valuable data while using AI to maintain its relevance as a primary source for human-to-human information.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon to Replace Human Line Judges with Electronic Line Calling for First Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 05:17:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in its 148-year history, the Wimbledon Championships will not use human line judges, opting instead for a fully electronic line-calling system. The move follows a trend seen at other major tournaments and on the professional tours, which have adopted the technology to increase accuracy. While traditionalists may miss the human element and the drama of player challenges, the change aims to streamline matches. The absence of line judges marks a significant shift for the tournament, raising questions about the future of officiating and the pathway for aspiring chair umpires.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited Kyiv, reaffirming Germany's unwavering support for Ukraine in its defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. Wadephul stated that Ukraine's freedom is the "most important task" in Germany's foreign and security policy and promised continued military, humanitarian, and economic aid. The visit comes after a week of intense Russian bombardments across Ukraine. Germany remains the second-largest provider of military aid to Kyiv, though it continues to withhold long-range Taurus missiles, instead pledging to help Ukraine develop its own independent missile capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the UK and the US has come into force, providing British car manufacturers with preferential access to the American market. The deal allows up to 100,000 UK-made vehicles to be sold in the US with a 10% tariff, a significant reduction. However, a resolution for UK steel and aluminum exports remains elusive, as they are still subject to a 25% tariff that could double if a deal isn't reached by a July 9 deadline. In return, the UK will scrap tariffs on US beef and ethanol imports, a move that has raised concerns among British farmers and bioethanol producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong stock exchange surged to become the world's top venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the first half of the year, with companies raising a total of US$13.5 billion. This represents an eightfold increase from the same period last year and marks the city's best first-half performance since 2021. According to LSEG data, Hong Kong surpassed both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. The resurgence is attributed to increased participation from international investors, significant capital inflows from mainland China, and strong post-listing performance for newly listed companies.
