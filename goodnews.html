          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst predictions. This positive result was achieved despite mixed performance in its investment banking division and the negative impact of a strong euro against the U.S. dollar. The bank's CEO, Christian Sewing, affirmed that the company is on course to meet its 2025 financial targets, citing a strong CET 1 capital ratio of 14.2%. However, the lender faces headwinds from a lower interest rate environment in Europe and ongoing trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a program offering monthly subsidy vouchers to its senior citizens to alleviate financial burdens and stimulate the elderly-care service market. The electronic coupons, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, will be provided to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. This initiative represents a rare form of direct fiscal support from Beijing, aimed at strengthening the social safety net as the country grapples with a rapidly aging population. Economists see this as a positive step toward unlocking domestic consumption by reducing households' precautionary savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Their successful appeal to the Supreme Court has overturned their prison sentences and raises the possibility that seven other traders convicted of similar offenses could also appeal. The ruling has prompted calls from senior politicians for a public inquiry into the scandal, focusing on the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods. The traders maintain they were made scapegoats for the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that former President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating that the order's attempt to deny citizenship to many individuals born in the United States violates the 14th Amendment. This ruling marks the first time an appeals court has weighed in on the matter, bringing the contentious issue a step closer to the Supreme Court. The administration had argued the Constitution's jurisdiction clause allows for such restrictions.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing crisis, a growing number of states are enacting laws to compel local governments to allow for the construction of more affordable and denser housing. In states like Utah, rising home prices have made homeownership unattainable for a large portion of the population, prompting state-level intervention to override restrictive local zoning rules. While these measures aim to address a critical housing shortage, they often face significant pushback from local communities concerned about overcrowding, infrastructure strain, and loss of local control. The trend highlights a major policy battle between state and local governments over how to solve housing affordability.</p>

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps per day can substantially boost brainpower and lower the risk of serious health issues like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research suggests this more attainable goal could be more effective for public health than the popular but non-evidence-based 10,000-step benchmark. The analysis of over 160,000 adults found that achieving 7,000 steps was linked to a 38% reduced risk of dementia and a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to walking 2,000 steps. Researchers believe this could encourage more people to track their activity.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, successfully avoiding a technical recession.

This performance marks a reversal from the 0.2% contraction seen in the first quarter of the year. However, economists remain cautious, noting that domestic demand is still soft and that the export-led growth could be threatened by potential U.S. tariffs if a trade deal is not reached.
