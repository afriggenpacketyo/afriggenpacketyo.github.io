          <p>Alaa Maso, an Olympic refugee swimmer from Syria, is seeking German citizenship and advocating for better integration policies for newcomers. Having arrived in Germany in 2015 due to the Syrian civil war, Maso emphasizes that "home is wherever you feel yourself at home." He suggests workshops to help refugees adapt to German culture while retaining their own, and his application for citizenship is strongly supported for his community contributions.

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, driven by falling retail and gas prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This article indicates that the central bank has already loosened monetary policy twice this year to counter weaker economic growth and anticipates further easing if inflation remains low.

The heat is short-lived, with a more changeable, cooler, and wetter week ahead, which may offer some relief after a particularly dry summer that has led to hosepipe bans and concerns for harvests.</p>
