          <p>New York Giants' first-round draft pick Jaxson Dart decided against purchasing his preferred jersey number, No. 2, from cornerback Deonte Banks due to the high price. Banks had previously acquired the number after reaching a deal with Russell Wilson. Dart, who wore No. 2 at Ole Miss, will instead wear No. 6, stating that the cost was simply "too much." The NFL's rookie pay scales limit salary negotiations, and Dart is slated to earn $16.9 million over four years with a $9 million signing bonus.</p>

          <p>Physicists are recording rocket launches, primarily by SpaceX, to learn about the acoustics of spaceflight and address the increasing noise pollution from frequent launches. Kent Gee from Brigham Young University is studying why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and is preparing for the even louder Starship rocket. The research aims to understand how sound waves travel, influenced by atmospheric conditions, and to determine acceptable noise levels for communities near launch sites. This effort seeks to proactively address potential noise issues before they become widespread and entrenched.</p>
