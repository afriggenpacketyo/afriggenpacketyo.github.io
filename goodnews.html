          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate, remaining in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, at its meeting, signaling a cautious approach amid economic uncertainties. President Trump has urged the Fed to lower rates, especially after a recent slowdown in job creation. Analysts suggest the Fed is waiting to assess the full impact of President Trump's tariffs on the economy. The article also discusses what the Fed's decision means for consumers, including the expectation that credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages will remain high (not investment advice).</p>

These celebrations often combine traditional festivities with a focus on community, education, and political empowerment.

The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, saw the prototype rocket reach an altitude of nearly 1,000 feet before landing close to its target. Honda intends to utilize technologies from its existing products and automated driving systems to develop reusable rockets for satellite launches and environmental monitoring.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Trump imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments by strategically altering products to fit into lower-tariffed categories. This practice involves changing materials, dimensions, or compositions to meet different harmonized system codes. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and modifying footwear to be categorized as slippers. While legal, this approach faces challenges in heavily regulated sectors requiring extensive validation for even minor changes (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions, preventing women in England and Wales from being investigated, arrested, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of the term. This reform is the biggest change to British abortion laws in nearly 60 years, contrasting with efforts in the U.S. to limit abortion access. The new law does not alter rules for abortions in clinical settings or prosecutions for those assisting women in obtaining late-term abortions. The law now requires approval from the House of Lords, where it is expected to pass.</p>

The Dodgers are aiming for a strong starting rotation by mid-July, contingent on the return of key pitchers from rehabilitation.

He acknowledges a naivety in assuming that providing scientific facts would be sufficient to convince people, emphasizing the need for better science communication, listening to concerns, and telling stories rather than relying solely on statistics. Collins suggests a need for scientists to embrace uncertainty and for society to prioritize truth, possibly through a truth and reconciliation commission, to rebuild trust in science.</p>

          <p>The 50+1 rule in German football ensures that club members retain control over professional football clubs, preventing external investors from gaining complete control. This rule, in place since 1999, requires the parent club to hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. While the rule protects fan culture and promotes equality, critics argue it puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to those in other countries with more investor involvement.
