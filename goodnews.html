          <p>The UK government plans to spend ¬£1.5 billion on at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its weapons production capabilities. This investment aims to support the creation of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and generate approximately 1,800 new jobs. The initiative is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review, prompted by the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production. Ministers assert that this investment will strengthen the armed forces and stimulate economic growth by bolstering the UK's defense industry.</p>
