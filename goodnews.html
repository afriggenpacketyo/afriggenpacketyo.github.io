          <p>Major Wall Street firms are showing increasing interest in stablecoins, viewing them as a transformative financial technology with a market potential estimated in the trillions. The article highlights how companies like ScaleAI and SpaceX already use stablecoins for global payments, drawing a parallel to the value creation seen with the advent of credit cards. Industry experts suggest that as regulatory clarity improves, traditional financial institutions will likely enter the market, which is essential for it to reach its projected multi-trillion dollar valuation.
