          <h2>World Gold Council Analyst Dismisses Crypto as Threat to Gold's Safe-Haven Status</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 00:42:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>John Reade, a senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, asserts that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. He argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade emphasizes that cryptocurrencies do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of them being "gold 2.0." His comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies grows, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. He wishes proponents of digital assets would stop marketing them as 'gold 2.0', when they very clearly have different characteristics. </p>

          <p>Google Cloud experienced significant global outages, disrupting several major internet services, including OpenAI and Shopify. Google's status page indicated the outages began in the morning, with engineers working to recover service. The outages are a setback for Google, which is trying to keep pace in cloud infrastructure with rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The incident caused problems for multiple cloud services across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, affecting web services like Twitch, GitHub, and Mailchimp. Thomas Kurian, the head of Google Cloud, later announced that all services are back up and running and regretted the disruption this caused their customers. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has risen to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average age of all mothers increased from 28.7 years old in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, with first-time mothers averaging 27.5 years old. Experts attribute this shift to changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023. Economic factors and social media may contribute to this decline. </p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced he is leaving the company to join Meta as part of a $14.3 billion investment deal. Meta will acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI without voting power, and Jason Droege will take over as CEO of Scale AI. A small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta as part of the agreement. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to bolster his company's AI efforts amid fierce competition from OpenAI and Google-parent Alphabet, with Wang overseeing AI initiatives deemed crucial for the company. Scale AI counts Meta rivals as customers, but the spokesperson said Meta's investment and hiring of Wang will not impact the startup's customers. </p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is set to kick off in the U.S. with a revamped 32-team format, offering a $1 billion prize pot, but it faces controversy due to player complaints about an already congested schedule. The tournament represents a bold gamble by FIFA, aiming to introduce a more global club competition, but ticket sales have been sluggish, forcing FIFA to slash prices. The tournament will feature some of the world's top teams, including Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, and will consist of 63 games played across 11 cities. The streaming platform DAZN has the global rights and will offer all games free. </p>

          <p>Dan Wang, an astute observer of contemporary China, describes the country as the ‚Äúengineering state‚Äù due to its emphasis on building and innovation in various engineering fields. China's integrated transport system, including subway trains and high-speed rail, seems like the stuff of science fiction. The nation's STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one, with most of the nation‚Äôs top officials being engineers. Wang contrasts this with the United States, which he calls the ‚Äúlawyerly state,‚Äù highlighting the difference in priorities and expertise between the two nations. </p>
