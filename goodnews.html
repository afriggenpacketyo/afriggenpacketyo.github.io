          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is directing his company's future towards a comprehensive artificial intelligence strategy, believing that artificial superintelligence (ASI) will arrive within a decade. Building on his historic investment in Alibaba, Son is now aggressively acquiring and investing in AI-related firms, from chip designers like Arm to AI model creators like OpenAI. Despite past setbacks with the Vision Fund and an early, unsuccessful venture into robotics, Son's long-held vision is to create a powerful, integrated AI ecosystem. This high-risk, high-reward strategy positions SoftBank at the forefront of what Son believes is the next fundamental technological revolution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a trend driven by climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine life. Scientists and naturalists have observed an influx of species not typically found in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. This warming trend, which includes more frequent and intense marine heatwaves, is also negatively impacting cold-adapted native species like cod. The changes pose challenges to local ecosystems and fishing communities, highlighting the tangible effects of rising global temperatures on the marine environment.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol made Major League Baseball history by becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season game, working at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was celebrated by family and supporters, and she later donated her cap to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Pawol, 48, has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016 and worked her way up to the Triple-A level before her historic promotion. Her milestone achievement was praised by MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred as a testament to her dedication and a powerful example for aspiring women and girls.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England find jobs, addressing a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available positions. The plan aims to simplify regulations and cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to hire staff based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid already strained budgets. The changes come as health unions continue to dispute the government's recent pay award.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, strengthening his case for the backup role. Lance demonstrated confidence and mobility, rushing seven times for 48 yards and scoring a five-yard touchdown on a designed run. Meanwhile, competing quarterback Taylor Heinicke appeared rusty in his first preseason action, completing only one of five passes. The game also highlighted a standout performance from undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rogers, who recorded two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>

          <p>In a segment for 60 Minutes, actress Jamie Lee Curtis revisited key props and costumes from her celebrated career, curated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She examined her mother Janet Leigh's script from Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," noting that the shocking film led her mother to only take baths for the rest of her life. Curtis also shared the clapboard she kept from 1978's "Halloween" and discussed how she conceived the iconic striptease scene in "True Lies" to be comedic rather than purely revealing. The actress reflected on these objects as signposts in a career that has spanned over four decades.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their collaborative "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe constituted cultural appropriation. The design was inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals but was reportedly made in China without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities who originated the style. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who condemned the practice. Chavarria expressed deep regret for not partnering with the Oaxacan community, and Adidas has committed to a respectful dialogue to honor their cultural legacy.</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Blocks Commercial Fishing in Pacific Remote Islands Marine Monument</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has ruled that a Trump administration directive allowing commercial fishing in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument is illegal. The decision overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse protections established by the Obama administration. The court stated that the agency violated federal law by bypassing the required public notice and comment process for changing fishing regulations. This ruling is a significant victory for environmental and Native Hawaiian groups who sued to protect the monument's vulnerable ecosystems, coral reefs, and cultural heritage.</p>
