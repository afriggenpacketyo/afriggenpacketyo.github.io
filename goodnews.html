          <p>Artificial intelligence company OpenAI is substantially increasing the size of its secondary share sale from an initial $6 billion to approximately $10.3 billion. This offering allows eligible current and former employees to sell their stock at a company valuation of $500 billion, a significant increase from its previous $300 billion valuation earlier in the year. The transaction, which includes investors like SoftBank and Thrive Capital, provides liquidity for employees without the immediate pressure of an initial public offering. The deal is expected to close in October, following a trend among high-value startups to offer periodic equity sales for staff.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has officially identified the remains of Jerome M. Mullaney, a U.S. Navy seaman who was 18 when he was killed in World War II. Mullaney died in June 1944 when his ship, the USS Glennon, struck an underwater mine off the coast of France two days after participating in the D-Day invasion. His remains were recovered in 1957 but could not be identified at the time and were interred in Belgium. Through modern DNA analysis and other scientific methods, his identity was confirmed in March 2025, bringing long-awaited closure to his surviving family members.</p>

          <p>A Long Island judge has ruled that evidence from advanced DNA testing can be used in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer, setting a new legal precedent for New York state courts. The cutting-edge technique, known as whole genome sequencing, was used by Astrea Forensics to link hair strands found with victims to Heuermann and his family members. Prosecutors hailed the decision as a major victory, stating that the science is reliable and accepted within the scientific community. The defense immediately challenged the ruling on the grounds that the lab is not licensed in New York, with a decision on that challenge expected later this month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks is enhancing its operational efficiency by partnering with NomadGo to implement an AI-powered inventory management system, aiming to automate counting and reduce waste. This move aligns with CEO Brian Niccol's focus on technology to streamline both front-end and back-end operations, complementing a recent reduction in U.S. production schedules. Meanwhile, investors are cautiously awaiting Salesforce's earnings report, concerned about how the rise of generative and agentic AI could disrupt the company's software-as-a-service "seat model." The core concern is that increased employee efficiency from AI could lead to reduced demand for software licenses, posing a long-term challenge for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new, 70-minute adaptation of "The Wizard of Oz" is now showing at the technologically advanced Sphere in Las Vegas, offering an immersive experience with massive 16K screens, vibrating seats, and even drone-piloted flying monkeys. The production, which cost around $100 million to adapt, aims to augment the classic film with digital and generative AI imagery, creating a theme-park-like ride. While visually stunning, particularly during the tornado scene, the review notes that the high-definition spectacle can sometimes detract from the film's original emotional depth and charm. With ticket prices starting over $100, the experience tests whether audiences will pay a premium for a high-tech version of a beloved classic.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Think Tank Report Advises Washington to De-escalate Rhetoric on Potential Taiwan Invasion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from a Washington-based think tank argues that the U.S. should moderate its rhetoric and defense investments related to the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The authors contend that strategic, political, and military factors make such an invasion less imminent than often portrayed, challenging what they describe as Washington's "threat inflation." Beijing considers self-governed Taiwan a renegade province and has ordered its military to be capable of an invasion by 2027. However, the report suggests a less alarmist approach would better serve U.S. interests as Congress finalizes its annual defense authorization bill, which includes measures aimed at countering China.</p>

          <p>The online prediction market platform Polymarket is set to launch in the United States after receiving a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The company's CEO, Shayne Coplan, announced that the regulatory body had cleared the way for the site to go live. The CFTC's relevant divisions adopted a "no-action position" regarding certain data reporting rules for event contracts, effectively removing a key regulatory hurdle. This development follows the conclusion of investigations by the CFTC and the Justice Department in July, which ended without any charges being filed against the company for potentially accepting bets from U.S. individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion, a new wave of AI-powered tools has emerged, promising to help consumers negotiate with creditors to settle their debts for less. These platforms offer a lower-cost and more accessible alternative to traditional debt relief companies, often working for free or a small fee. While benefits include speed and personalized strategies, potential downsides include a lack of flexibility for complex cases and fewer consumer protections compared to regulated debt relief firms. For those with significant or complicated debt, the human expertise and legal safeguards of an established company may still be the more prudent choice. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, savers with a significant sum like $25,000 should consider higher-earning options such as Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A comparison shows that while a high-yield savings account currently offers a slightly higher rate, the earnings difference over a year is minimal, around $25. The key distinction is that CD rates are fixed, guaranteeing a return, whereas high-yield savings rates are variable and likely to decrease with expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Savers must weigh the potential for slightly higher but uncertain returns against the security of a locked-in rate. (not investment advice)</p>

His nomination comes amid concerns that the president seeks to exert more influence over the Fed's monetary policy, particularly its decisions on interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Long-term studies of survivors of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, have revealed a surprising psychological outcome known as post-traumatic growth. While many survivors suffered from lasting PTSD and depression, a significant percentage also reported positive personal changes, such as a greater appreciation for life, improved relationships, and increased personal strength. Researchers found that this growth often coexisted with post-traumatic stress, and was more likely among those who had strong social support and a sense of self-efficacy. These findings offer hopeful lessons on resilience and recovery in the face of catastrophic events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 on September 17, mortgage rates may begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of a central bank move. This pattern was observed last year when rates dropped just before a Fed cut was issued. With the probability of a reduction now over 95%, lenders are likely to start pricing in the change, potentially offering relief to homebuyers sooner than the formal announcement.
