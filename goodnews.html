          <p>Tina, a brain injury survivor, has found a new means of communication through British Sign Language (BSL) after struggling to speak following a traumatic accident in 2018. The accident, which left her in a coma for six weeks, significantly impacted her ability to speak, prompting her to learn BSL. Tina and her husband Mark participated in a BBC series where actress Rose Ayling-Ellis taught BSL to older residents, which allowed her to gain confidence and a new way to express herself. Now, Tina has earned a Level 1 BSL qualification and Mark leads regular practice sessions, highlighting the benefits of sign language for communication and emotional understanding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and other world leaders convened in Egypt to sign a Gaza peace deal following the release of all living hostages by Hamas. The agreement, dubbed "The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity," outlines commitments to protect human rights and resolve disputes diplomatically. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent due to a Jewish holiday, Trump praised him as a great wartime leader during an address to Israel's parliament. Trump also emphasized the need for rebuilding Gaza and urged Iran to engage in peace negotiations, signaling a potential shift in regional dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, the Milwaukee Brewers executed a strange double play against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Max Muncy hit a long drive to center field, which Brewers center fielder Sal Frelick misplayed off his glove, hitting the wall. Frelick recovered and threw the ball to the infield, where the defense forced out Teoscar Hernandez. Will Smith misjudged the play, allowing William Contreras to tag him out at third, ending the inning and preventing the Dodgers from scoring. The Dodgers, defending their 2024 World Series title, are competing against the Brewers, who are back in the NLCS for the first time since 2018.</p>

          <p>China has announced the mass production of the world's first ultra-low noise, single-photon detector with four channels, known as the "photon catcher." This device can detect individual photons, making it a core component in technologies like quantum communication and quantum radar, which can be used for stealth aircraft detection and tracking. Developed by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province, this advancement signifies China's progress in quantum technology and its potential applications in both daily communications and national defense, highlighting the country's growing capabilities in advanced technology sectors.</p>

          <p>NATO chief Mark Rutte humorously commented on the condition of Russia's naval fleet, referencing a submarine that had to surface due to technical problems. Rutte joked that the vessel was "limping" home and noted the diminished Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean. This followed reports of fuel leaking into the submarine's hold, raising explosion risks, and the Royal Navy tracking the vessel through the English Channel. The Russian Black Sea Fleet denied any malfunction, stating the submarine surfaced to comply with navigation rules, but Rutte's remarks underscored the challenges facing the Russian navy.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully conducted another test flight of its mega Starship rocket, achieving a controlled entry of the booster into the Gulf of Mexico and the spacecraft descending into the Indian Ocean. This was the 11th test flight for the full-scale Starship, intended for missions to Mars and lunar landings for NASA. The spacecraft released mock satellites during its journey, and SpaceX performed maneuvering tests over the Indian Ocean in preparation for future landings.

This data will help increase educational programs and law enforcement visibility in high-risk areas, aiming to prevent tragedies caused by distracted driving and improve road safety.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation to increase the pay for incarcerated firefighters from approximately $1 per hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Assembly Bill 247 takes effect immediately and is supported by a $10 million budget allocation. The move aims to address social justice concerns regarding low wages for inmates who perform dangerous work battling wildfires, which are a significant part of the state’s firefighting efforts. The new law does not raise wages to the state minimum, but marks a significant increase.</p>

          <p>The Gaza peace plan, brokered by President Trump, advanced with Hamas releasing the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and increased aid flow.

Negotiations will need to address these challenges, and Israel has hinted at resuming military operations if its demands are not met. The plan also involves establishing a new Palestinian security force and reconstructing Gaza, requiring significant international cooperation and funding.</p>

          <p>The government is advising organizations to prepare for potential cyber-attacks by creating backup plans using pen and paper, as recent hacks have caused significant disruptions. The National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) has reported an increase in severe cyber-attacks, urging businesses to focus on "resilience engineering." These plans should detail how to operate without IT systems and rebuild them quickly following an attack. While the total number of attacks remained steady, there was a notable rise in nationally significant incidents, prompting the government to recommend better use of free cybersecurity tools.</p>
