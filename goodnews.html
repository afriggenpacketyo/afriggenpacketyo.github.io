        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the expansion of state-funded healthcare benefits for low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026, as the state faces a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected costs for the program and economic uncertainty related to federal tariff policies. Those already enrolled will not be affected, but new applications will be frozen, and a monthly premium of $100 will be introduced for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" starting in 2027. Newsom blamed President Trump's tariff policies for contributing to the state's financial challenges. </p>
