          <p>Following a two-decade-long legal fight, five partially completed homes in Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon neighborhood will be torn down under a plea agreement with the developers. The city originally halted construction on the project in 2002 pending an environmental impact assessment that never occurred. The dilapidated structures have been a persistent issue for the community, with successive owners attempting to restart construction without authorization. The current owners pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders and must demolish the homes by August 2026.</p>

          <p>As the 2026 race to become California's next governor takes shape, a diverse field of candidates is weighing in on the performance of current Governor Gavin Newsom. In interviews, candidates from both major parties offered their assessments of his administration. Democrats like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised his efforts to strengthen the economy and challenge the Trump administration, while Republicans such as Chad Bianco and Leo Zacky struggled to name any positive achievements.

The pricing landed in the middle of its projected range as it prepares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." This public debut marks a significant event in a rebounding IPO market, following several delays by the company. StubHub's move to go public comes after its co-founder reacquired the company from eBay in 2020.</p>

          <p>Powerful winds in Washington state have stirred up dormant volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, leading to hazy skies and diminished air quality. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry conditions and strong gusts lift the fine particles back into the atmosphere. The U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have both confirmed that this is not the result of new volcanic activity. The volcano's alert level remains at "Normal," though the resuspended ash is considered a potential hazard for aircraft.</p>

The move was heavily influenced by the players' strong desire to represent their countries in a best-on-best international tournament.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, stated that he does not foresee a trend of major sports franchises going public. He argued that teams and ownership groups are valued more highly as private assets, as public markets have not historically embraced the long-term, often unprofitable, spending required to build a championship-winning team. Harris emphasized that private ownership allows for a focus on winning over short-term financial returns, a strategy that public shareholders might not support. His group owns stakes in several major teams, including the NFL's Washington Commanders.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major technology companies, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, and OpenAI, has announced plans to invest over $40 billion in the United Kingdom's artificial intelligence infrastructure. The commitments, revealed during President Trump's state visit, will fund the development of the UK's largest supercomputer and new data centers. Microsoft's president noted that the UK's improved regulatory climate made such a large-scale investment conceivable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell sharply on Tuesday to its lowest point since late 2022. This decline comes as investors anticipate a widely expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Analysts note, however, that this trend could be short-lived, drawing parallels to a similar situation in September 2024 when mortgage rates paradoxically increased after the Fed announced a cut. The current economic environment is not considered recessionary, which could also limit the impact of the Fed's actions on long-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>
