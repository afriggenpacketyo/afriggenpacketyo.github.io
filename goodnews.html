The calculator requires users to input their weekly income details to determine potential savings. The bill has garnered support from various industries but faces opposition from some Republican senators concerned about its impact on the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after serving 23 years in prison for a wrongful conviction linked to now-retired Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was framed for murder after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect in a shooting. He is the 51st person exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions. Despite the exoneration, a carjacking conviction remained on McDowell's record until a judge vacated it, emphasizing Guevara's pattern of misconduct.</p>

          <p>Police in Clearwater, Florida, have identified the body of Edman Eric Gleed, an 84-year-old man, more than 31 years after his remains were found floating near a bridge. Advanced DNA tests and investigative genetic genealogy led to the identification of Gleed, who had been listed as missing from Fairfax County, Virginia, since 1993. The genealogical search uncovered connections to an 18th-century couple from Bristol, England, allowing investigators to identify Gleed. The identification provides closure for Gleed's family, including his 94-year-old son.</p>
