        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, a key associate of Jeffrey Epstein. In his ruling, Judge Paul Engelmayer criticized the government's reasoning as "demonstrably false," stating the materials would not reveal significant new information about the case. The judge suggested the motion might be a public relations "diversion" rather than a genuine effort at transparency, noting the documents are not the trove of new evidence some might expect. This marks the second judicial denial of such a request concerning the Epstein investigations.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $2 billion into its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new line of more affordable electric vehicles, starting with a midsize electric pickup in 2027 priced around $30,000. This "Universal EV Program" aims to create a modern "Model T moment" and compete with global manufacturers, particularly from China. The investment is expected to secure approximately 2,200 jobs, though overall employment at the retooled plant will decrease slightly. Ford emphasized that the new LFP batteries for these EVs will be assembled in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The online retail landscape is facing a significant shift as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT move towards integrating direct checkout functionalities, potentially partnering with services like Shopify and PayPal. This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface, streamlining the process and creating a new "marketplace" controlled by AI assistants. Experts believe this change could disrupt the e-commerce value chain, shifting the focus from who closes the sale to who controls the pre-sale customer attention, posing a threat to traditional online retailers and payment processors.</p>

The company is forecasting a second consecutive quarter of growth, driven by an increase in average order value and better client retention. While its customer base is still shrinking, Stitch Fix has focused on improving its service flexibility, revamping its private brands, and cutting over $100 million in costs to stabilize the business and chart a path back to profitability.

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, Nvidia and AMD have secured export licenses to sell specific AI chips to China by agreeing to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from these sales. The deal, confirmed by the White House, allows the companies to resume shipping sanctioned products like Nvidia's H20 chip, providing access to the lucrative Chinese market. While investors view it as a net positive, analysts note the transactional nature of the deal sets a strange precedent and raises long-term questions about potential future government cuts and China's reaction.

The first event is scheduled for New Jersey, with future town halls planned in key states like Texas, California, and Georgia.

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers are considering whether to place funds in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) or a certificate of deposit (CD). Experts suggest HYSAs are better for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who can lock away their money to guarantee a fixed, often higher, return, which is advantageous in an environment where rates are expected to fall. Some advisors also recommend a "laddering" strategy, splitting funds between both to balance liquidity with higher earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

The absence of key midfielder Ryan Gravenberch highlighted instability, with Virgil van Dijk looking unsettled.
