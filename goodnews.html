          <p>The once-close alliance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated, leading to public attacks and potential ramifications for the Republican Party. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his suggestion of a new political party have caused concern among some Republicans. The billionaire's past financial support for the GOP raises questions about future donations, especially with the midterm elections approaching. While some downplay the feud, others worry about the impact of Musk's influence on key issues and the party's unity. The situation remains fluid, with some signs of a possible reconciliation, but the long-term effects on the Republican landscape are uncertain. The optimism score is based on the potential for reconciliation and the resilience of the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new, more public-facing role, just two days after resigning as chairman. He will lead the party's "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf attributed his initial departure to exhaustion after 11 months of intense work building the party. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regrets his actions and will now appear more frequently in the media. His reinstatement follows criticism of a party member's stance on burqas, which Yusuf deemed inconsistent with party policy.</p>

          <p>A study by Inspired Taste has revealed distinct regional preferences for pasta shapes across the United States. Spaghetti is the national favorite, dominating in 20 states, while penne is a close second, leading in 17 states, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Elbows, despite being the fourth most popular nationally, are not a favorite in any single state. California favors fettuccine, while Hawaii and New Mexico prefer angel hair pasta; South Dakota, Alaska, and Montana favor rotini.

West Indies struggled without star all-rounder Hayley Matthews, collapsing to 4-3 early in their innings. Sarah Glenn was the standout bowler for England, taking 3-21.

Sophia Dunkley made 26 at the top of the order as England rejigged their batting line-up, while Alice Capsey finished unbeaten on 20 in another one-sided affair. West Indies, who were again without star all-rounder Hayley Matthews because of a shoulder injury, had slipped to 4-3 inside the first four overs after England chose to bowl first under gloomy skies. England also won the preceding T20 series 3-0, and their summer continues with three T20s and three ODIs against India, starting at Trent Bridge on 28 June.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore cuts to police hiring made by the council. The agreement ensures that funds will be identified for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days. This decision reverses a previous reduction in the number of police officers to be hired in the coming fiscal year. The restoration of police recruits would require the council to allocate an additional $13.3 million for the coming year. The move aims to address public safety concerns and invest in emergency response services.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, the politics of remembrance has gained traction, with three new initiatives attempting to address historical injustices. These include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing a "double debt" to Haiti. While these initiatives have been adopted, they lack concrete political steps or financial agreements. Some see this as a form of social maturity, while others view it as symbolic gestures in a politically paralyzed legislature.

          <p>Financial expert Dave Ramsey warns that nearly half of Americans are making a significant mistake regarding Social Security, potentially jeopardizing their retirement security. His analysis highlights that many individuals are not saving enough for retirement, relying too heavily on Social Security benefits, which typically replace only a portion of pre-retirement income. Ramsey advises creating a savings benchmark, aiming to save at least 15% of gross income, and seeking professional financial advice to develop a personalized retirement plan. By taking proactive steps, individuals can improve their chances of a financially secure retirement (not investment advice).</p>

After the Islamist militia Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, Scholz's response was essentially to insist on Israel's right to defend itself, but Merz said he no longer understood Israel's actions in the Gaza war.</p>
