          <p>America's oldest-running distillery, Buffalo Trace in Frankfort, Kentucky, has reopened just in time for the Kentucky Derby after being hit by severe flooding. The Kentucky River rose to over 48 feet, inundating the 400-acre campus with several feet of water, damaging every building on the site. Despite the extensive damage and a history of weathering storms, the distillery has no plans to relocate and is committed to remaining in Frankfort. The reopening is a positive step for the community, which depends on the distillery for jobs and economic stability.</p>

          <p>As China pushes for scientific advancement and a hi-tech workforce, the role of the humanities in the education system is under scrutiny. While some universities are reducing arts and social science enrollments, others argue that the humanities are essential for addressing fundamental issues and preserving cultural complexity. The humanities are evolving to incorporate AI and other technologies, creating new interdisciplinary fields.

          <p>Florida lawmakers have sent the governor a measure aimed at providing relief for condominium owners struggling with rising costs in aging buildings, while still addressing safety concerns. The bill pushes back the deadline for completing structural integrity inspections and allows condo associations a two-year grace period in fully funding reserves. It also allows condo associations to secure loans and lines of credit to fund repairs. The legislation is a response to concerns about the financial impact of stricter condo safety requirements implemented after the Surfside building collapse.</p>

          <p>An election is likely to incorporate a new city on the southern tip of Texas dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX company. Local residents are voting on incorporating a patch of land known as Boca Chica Village as a new municipality called Starbase. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. The creation of a new municipality would establish a local government with a mayor and two commissioners that would have power over planning, taxation and other local issues.</p>
