          <p>The annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest took place in New York City, marking a major Fourth of July tradition. The event saw Miki Sudo secure her 11th victory in the women's competition by consuming 33 hot dogs. In the men's event, renowned competitive eater Joey Chestnut returned to compete after being banned the previous year due to a partnership with a rival brand. Chestnut, who holds the record of 76 hot dogs, aimed to reclaim his title from the defending champion, creating a highly anticipated showdown for the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt and cash prize.</p>

          <p>Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado, known for discovering the last U.S. slave ship, the Clotilda, has released a new book titled "The Great Museum of the Sea." In a recent interview, Delgado shared insights from his 50-year career investigating over 100 shipwrecks, including the Titanic. He describes the sea as the Earth's largest museum, where each wreck tells a unique story, whether of tragedy, bravery, or discovery. Delgado emphasized the extensive forensic and oceanographic research required to locate and understand these submerged historical sites, which often hold profound cultural and personal meanings.</p>

          <p>Germany has significantly increased its defense budget to modernize its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, in response to geopolitical shifts, a move celebrated by the arms industry. Defense contractor Hensoldt's CEO called the spending a "gigantic economic stimulus program," and companies like Rheinmetall have seen their stock prices soar. However, some economists are skeptical, arguing that military spending offers a low return on investment compared to infrastructure or education. They warn that while the defense sector profits, the broader economic boost may be moderate and could primarily inflate prices rather than generate substantial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence, reflecting on its significant progress since 1975. The island nation has achieved development indicators above the African average, particularly in education and healthcare, with literacy rates rising dramatically and life expectancy among the highest on the continent. Despite these successes, challenges such as youth unemployment and migration persist, with a notable portion of its young, educated population seeking opportunities abroad. The government continues to implement social policies to combat poverty, supported in part by a tourism tax, as the nation builds on its legacy of stability.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton secured his place in the third round of Wimbledon by winning his match against Rinky Hijikata in just 70 seconds of play on Friday. The match had been controversially suspended the previous night due to fading light, with Shelton on the verge of victory at 5-4 in the final set. Upon resumption, Shelton served three aces and one unreturnable serve to close out the win. He later explained the suspension was due to the Hawk-Eye line-calling system being about to shut down, and he found the humor in the bizarrely brief conclusion.</p>

          <p>Despite Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys to prevent addiction among children, analysts believe Pop Mart International, maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults and millennials, not the young children targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas revenue, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provides a cushion against potential domestic market headwinds. The brand's success is attributed to the "affordable exclusivity" and excitement that the mystery-box purchasing model offers to consumers.</p>

          <p>International security expert Robert Pape has suggested that the U.S. could learn from China's "Wuhan model" to revitalize its former industrial heartland. After a trip to China, Pape noted how second-tier cities like Wuhan have successfully created integrated university-industry clusters focused on advanced manufacturing, a strategy he believes could be adapted for American rust-belt cities. This proposal comes during a period of de-escalated trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The idea posits that such collaboration could not only spur economic growth but also help stabilize the complex relationship between the two global superpowers.</p>

          <p>One of Sweden's most wanted criminals, identified by media as 35-year-old Ismail Abdo, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is the alleged head of the Rumba crime organization and is accused of orchestrating drug trafficking and violent crimes in Sweden from abroad. His arrest is the result of long-term cooperation between Turkish and Swedish authorities. Sweden has been grappling with a surge in gang-related violence, including shootings and bombings, as criminal networks increasingly operate from other countries and recruit young people to carry out attacks.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Discover 125,000-Year-Old Neanderthal 'Fat Factory' in Germany</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 10:16:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically hunted large animals, smashed their bones, and boiled them to extract nutrient-rich marrow and fat. This process indicates a sophisticated understanding of nutrition, as a diet of lean meat alone can lead to protein poisoning. The finding adds to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were more intelligent and organized than previously thought, capable of complex planning and resource management to ensure their survival.</p>
