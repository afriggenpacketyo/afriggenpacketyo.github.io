          <p>In the current economic climate of high costs and interest rates, many individuals face unmanageable debt, making bankruptcy a potential solution. The article outlines four clear signs that this legal tool for a fresh start might be the most viable path forward. These indicators include using new debt to pay off existing debt, spending over half of one's income on essential bills, and considering draining retirement accounts. Another major red flag is facing imminent foreclosure or vehicle repossession, where bankruptcy's automatic stay can provide immediate protection. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer and Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw has criticized the Pittsburgh Steelers for their management of former quarterback Kenny Pickett. Bradshaw argued that the team failed to build a proper roster around the 2022 first-round draft pick, specifically citing a lack of protection from the offensive line and a shortage of offensive weapons. He contended that Pickett, who was traded after two seasons, was not a failure, but rather that the Steelers organization had failed him. Pickett is now with the Cleveland Browns after a brief stint with the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging app that operates without the internet. The app uses Bluetooth mesh networks to allow nearby devices to communicate directly, passing messages from phone to phone to extend its range. Designed for privacy and censorship resistance, Bitchat requires no central servers, phone numbers, or emails, and all messages are encrypted and ephemeral. The project reflects Dorsey's ongoing interest in decentralized technologies that can function even during internet shutdowns or surveillance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have officially concluded their review of the Jeffrey Epstein case, finding no evidence of a so-called "client list" that could implicate high-profile individuals. This finding contradicts widespread conspiracy theories and a campaign promise from President Trump to release such files. The investigation also reaffirmed the medical examiner's conclusion that Epstein died by suicide in his prison cell in 2019. The memo stated that investigators did not find credible evidence to predicate new investigations against any uncharged third parties associated with Epstein.</p>

          <p>On his show, Jim Cramer suggested that recent changes in U.S. export policy for chip design firms could open a path for Nvidia to resume selling certain AI chips to China. Meanwhile, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike received a ratings downgrade from Piper Sandler, which cited the stock's high valuation after a significant run-up in price. Analysts at the firm noted they see no immediate catalyst to raise their estimates further. Citigroup, however, raised its price target on Nvidia, citing an expanded forecast for the AI data center semiconductor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured a narrow victory over Jonathan Milan in a chaotic, crash-marred third stage of the Tour de France. The finish was overshadowed by several crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race and another in the final kilometers that involved top contenders. Despite the turmoil, Mathieu van der Poel retained the overall leader's yellow jersey, while general classification favorites Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard finished safely in the main pack. Merlier's victory marks his second career stage win in the prestigious cycling event.</p>

          <p>The film "F1," distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. The movie's success overtakes previous Apple-produced films like "Napoleon" and demonstrates the potential for streaming services to create content tailored for the big screen. The film has particularly benefited from a strategic partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total gross revenue. While the high-budget film still has a way to go to be profitable, its performance is a significant milestone for Apple's entertainment division.</p>
