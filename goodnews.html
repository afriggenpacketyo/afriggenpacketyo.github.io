          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings per share exceeded analysts' expectations, but revenue fell short, causing the company's shares to dip. While revenue grew 14% year-over-year, gross bookings in both the ride-hailing and delivery segments increased. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi remains optimistic, projecting strong gross bookings and EBITDA for the current quarter. The company is also expanding into autonomous vehicles, with 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. The company is dealing with a lawsuit from the FTC regarding its Uber One subscription service, which the CEO has defended.</p>

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora has cautioned that U.S. tariffs could lead to sweeping price increases across the affordable jewelry industry. CEO Alexander Lacik noted that current tariffs are manageable, but higher reciprocal rates would significantly impact manufacturers who rely on Asian production. Pandora, heavily dependent on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, previously warned of a potential hit to group revenues due to President Trump's tariff policies. The ultimate impact on consumer pricing is expected to be industry-led, depending on the level of tariffs imposed.</p>

          <p>David A. Kessler, former FDA commissioner, discusses the revolutionary impact of GLP-1 anti-obesity medications and emphasizes that they are not a magic bullet. While these drugs can significantly reduce cravings and promote weight loss, they should be used in conjunction with healthier eating, exercise, and behavioral therapies. The article highlights the need for more research on the long-term effects and safe discontinuation of these drugs. Kessler advocates for greater transparency in food labeling and dietary guidance tailored to individuals with insulin resistance, while also discussing his own experience with GLP-1 drugs.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a surge after the company indicated that sales of its weight loss drug Wegovy are expected to improve in the latter half of the year, with the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The Danish drugmaker reported lower-than-expected sales for Wegovy in the first quarter, which caused a trimming of its full-year sales growth forecast due to competition from alternative versions of the drug. The company anticipates increased sales once the FDA's drug shortage ruling ends, and compounded alternatives cease to be sold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Far-UVC light, a type of ultraviolet light, has the potential to kill airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes. Solid-state lamps, like LEDs, could make far-UVC disinfection cheaper and more accessible. A startup called Uviquity has developed a crystal that doubles the frequency of laser light, producing far-UVC light. Research is needed to understand the effects of far-UVC on air quality, but preliminary studies suggest that it can disinfect without significantly increasing ozone levels.</p>
