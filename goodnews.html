          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor has defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The final bout of their historic trilogy was a tactical and gripping contest, with Taylor boxing smartly and using her speed to counter Serrano's pressure. Unlike their contentious second fight, this verdict was more decisive, sealing a historic rivalry in women's boxing. Both fighters expressed immense respect for each other after the match, which concluded an all-female card at the iconic venue for the first time.</p>

          <p>A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky to face multiple charges. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of the man, Sedrick T. Stevenson, smiling broadly while seated on the plane under heavy guard. The multi-agency effort to secure his return was extensive, with officials joking he received "VIP service." Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from an agent at a ticket counter while in shackles.</p>

          <p>The UK's third heatwave of the year is spreading, with Scotland and Northern Ireland expected to see their warmest days of the year with temperatures potentially reaching 31°C. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and central England, warning of risks to the entire population, while less severe yellow warnings cover the north. The prolonged hot, dry conditions have prompted wildfire warnings, concerns about rail travel disruptions, and pleas from fire chiefs for caution around water as people try to cool down.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees from the company. The deal, reportedly valued at $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation, underscores the intense talent war in the artificial intelligence sector. Google is not acquiring Windsurf but will gain a nonexclusive license to its technology, which has become popular for "vibe coding." This move follows similar talent acquisitions by competitors like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon to bolster their AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a recent controversy. The move comes after the brand was criticized for showcasing sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their origin. A chamber of commerce representing the artisans called on Prada for recognition, leading to a meeting and this new initiative, which is being framed as a model for respectful collaboration between global fashion and traditional communities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting indiscriminate immigration raids in Los Angeles and several other California counties. The ruling enjoins federal agents from conducting stops based solely on factors like a person's apparent race, accent, or presence at certain locations without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation. This decision comes after a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups, which presented what the judge called a "mountain of evidence" of unconstitutional tactics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists allege their voices were cloned and sold on Lovo's platform without their consent after they were hired for what they were told was internal academic research. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract and deceptive business practices will proceed, marking a significant step for artists seeking accountability from AI companies.</p>
