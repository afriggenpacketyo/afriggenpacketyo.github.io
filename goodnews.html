          <p>English golfer Justin Rose won his first PGA Tour title in over two years, defeating American JJ Spaun in a three-hole sudden-death play-off at the St Jude Championship. Rose clinched the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole after both players matched scores on the first two. The win was a significant moment for the 45-year-old, who had a mixed final round before a late surge of four straight birdies forced the play-off. Meanwhile, England's Tommy Fleetwood, who held the lead entering the final round, finished tied for third, extending his long wait for a maiden PGA Tour victory.</p>

Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes, seemingly closing the gap with competitor Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty. The Chargers' defense also shined, with undrafted rookie Eric Rodgers securing two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, before leaving with an injury. The game provided a crucial opportunity for depth players to prove their value as the regular season approaches.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented arrangement, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from specific AI chips sold to China. This deal is in exchange for export licenses allowing the companies to sell the Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 chips in the Chinese market. The agreement highlights the Trump administration's strategy of using tariffs and trade negotiations as leverage in its complex economic relationship with China. This development follows recent high-stakes discussions and a threat from President Trump to implement 100% tariffs on semiconductor imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and collaborator Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal design. The footwear, inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans, was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Oaxacan communities who originated the style, drawing criticism from Mexico's president. In his statement, Chavarria expressed deep regret for not partnering directly with the community. Adidas has removed promotional images and stated its commitment to engaging in a respectful dialogue to honor the region's cultural legacy.</p>

          <h2>Historian Rana Mitter Argues China's Post-WWII Interests Lie in a Peaceful Asia-Pacific</h2>

          <p>Leading historian Rana Mitter, an expert on modern China, posits that World War II was a pivotal, yet often underestimated, factor in shaping the nation's trajectory. He explains that the immense destruction of infrastructure during Japan's invasion forced China to essentially rebuild from scratch after the war. Mitter, the S.T. Lee Chair in US-Asia Relations at the Harvard Kennedy School, suggests that understanding this history is key to recognizing China's contemporary interests. He argues that, 80 years on, the nation's primary strategic goal is to maintain a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Congratulations are being shared for President Trump after he won his sixth club championship of 2025 at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. The White House announced that the president shot a gross score of 69, which adjusted to a net 67 after his handicap, implying a low single-digit handicap. The win is another notable achievement in the 79-year-old president's active golf career. Since taking office, President Trump has played dozens of rounds and is known for his passion and skill in the sport, often more so than any previous U.S. president.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked a Trump administration move that would have allowed commercial fishing in the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument. The ruling overturns a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse protections established by the Obama administration. The court stated that the agency violated federal law by attempting to change the rules without the required public notice and comment period. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, who filed the lawsuit, celebrated the decision as a major victory for protecting the monument's vulnerable ecosystems and cultural heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's revamped lineup under new manager Arne Slot had a mixed debut in their Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace, showcasing both spectacular attacking potential and clear defensive vulnerabilities. Four new signings started, with Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike impressing in attack, but the team twice surrendered a lead to finish 2-2 before losing on penalties. The performance highlighted a need for defensive reinforcement, particularly at centre-back, and time for the new players to adapt to the system. While the loss was disappointing, the match provided an early look at the team's strengths and weaknesses.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed was the star performer as Trent Rockets maintained their unbeaten start in the men's Hundred, securing a five-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers. The 20-year-old first took two wickets to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase, which the Rockets completed with four balls remaining. Despite a mid-innings wobble against the Superchargers' spin bowlers, the Rockets' depth proved sufficient to see them over the line in a controlled, if occasionally tense, run chase.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams rookie running back Jarquez Hunter brings a unique blend of power and patience to the NFL, qualities he developed growing up in rural Mississippi. Known for his bruising running style at Auburn, where he rushed for over 3,300 yards, Hunter's strength is legendary, once squatting 645 pounds in high school. However, he credits the patience learned from breaking and tending to his horse, Danger, for his on-field discipline. This grit was on display in his preseason debut, where he impressed coaches with a hard-fought 11-yard gain, showcasing the focus he hopes will earn a spot in the running back rotation.</p>
