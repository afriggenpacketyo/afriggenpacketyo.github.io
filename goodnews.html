        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent debate among Democrats has focused on whether the party should prioritize "abundance reforms" or "populist" ones, with a new poll suggesting that voters prefer the latter. However, the political case for abundance policies rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal. There is no inherent tension between pursuing abundance liberalism and populism, as the former is compatible with increasing working people‚Äôs living standards and economic power. Ultimately, abundance liberalism is less about how Democrats should message than about how they should govern, and they should focus on the accuracy of their analysis of governance failures.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Nagasaki is currently considering a request from Taiwan to attend this year's ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of the city in August. Taiwan, which has never been officially invited to the memorial event, has expressed its desire to participate for the first time. Nagasaki plans to send invitations to countries and regions with diplomatic missions in Japan or representative offices at the United Nations, a criteria Taiwan does not meet. The decision is drawing a contrast with Hiroshima, which indicated it would add Taiwan to its list of participants after Taipei expressed its wish to join.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has acknowledged that his "frustration" led to a collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, admitting the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened". The Red Bull driver received a 10-second penalty for the incident, which dropped him from fifth to 10th in the final standings. Verstappen's penalty has widened the gap between him and championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who won the race. The incident also resulted in Verstappen receiving three penalty points on his license, bringing him close to a race ban.</p>

          <p>A major international trial has demonstrated that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can reduce the risk of dying by a third. The three-year program, initiated soon after chemotherapy, aimed to have participants exceed the exercise guidelines for the general population. Results showed that 80% of exercising patients remained cancer-free after five years, compared to 74% in the non-exercising group, and after eight years, the death rate was significantly lower in the exercise group. Scientists are investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vogue has declared that the word "chic" is dead, arguing that it has lost its essence and become overused to describe trends dictated by influencers. In response, there's a call to rehabilitate alternative words such as "snazzy," "trendy," and "swish" to add more linguistic variety and interest. While the word may be overused, it remains ingrained and useful, likely to outlive current trends. Perhaps new words and fresh perspectives can add more color to descriptions of style and fashion.</p>

          <p>California legislators are on the verge of overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark environmental law, with two proposals advancing rapidly through the Legislature. One proposal would eliminate the law for most urban housing developments, and the other would weaken the rules for most other projects. These efforts, endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would be the most significant changes to CEQA in generations, but have sparked opposition from environmental and labor groups. These changes are intended to address the state's housing shortage and streamline infrastructure projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is moving towards mandating a phonics-based approach to reading instruction in schools, marking a significant shift from the long-standing "whole language" or "balanced literacy" methods. This change is driven by persistent low reading scores and research supporting the effectiveness of the "science of reading," which emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The proposed law, which would take effect in phases starting in 2026, requires districts to adopt instructional materials based on the science of reading, and has garnered support from key stakeholders after a compromise on teacher training and curriculum selection.</p>
