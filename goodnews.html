          <h2>Surge in Electric Truck Sales in China Curbs Diesel Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 22:19:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a significant boom in the sales of electric-powered heavy trucks, a trend that is increasingly displacing diesel consumption and impacting oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and a rapidly expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged by 175% in the first half of the year. This rapid adoption, primarily for short-haul routes in industrial areas, has led analysts to revise down their forecasts for diesel demand and accelerate predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak. The shift is seen as a key factor in the country's transition towards cleaner energy in the transport sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the identification of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, are part of the country's broader strategy to enhance its resource security. Investment in mineral exploration, particularly for critical elements like tin, copper, and tungsten used in high-tech industries, has risen substantially. This effort aims to strengthen China's national energy and mineral resource security amid a global race for these valuable materials.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Poised to Restrict Indiscriminate Immigration Stops in Los Angeles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 21:56:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a tentative ruling indicating she will likely order the Trump administration to cease indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals as part of its mass deportation efforts. The lawsuit, filed by civil rights groups, alleges that federal agents have been targeting people based on their appearance without probable cause, leading to widespread fear in immigrant communities. During the hearing, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong questioned the government's lack of specific evidence to justify its agents' actions. A final order is expected soon, which could significantly impact federal immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major sanitation infrastructure project. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was deployed to the scene. Fortunately, none of the rescued workers sustained any visible injuries, and they were able to escape by climbing over a large pile of dirt. The project has been put on hold while Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the order from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This ruling comes after a recent Supreme Court decision that limited the use of universal injunctions but still allowed for class action suits as a legal pathway. The White House criticized the decision, vowing to fight what it called an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's ruling and impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of the two men convicted for the "Hillside Strangler" serial murders that terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, has been denied parole. The California Board of Parole Hearings made the decision after hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors. Bianchi, who along with his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. was responsible for the sexual assault, torture, and murder of at least 12 women, will not be eligible for another parole hearing for 10 years. Buono died in prison in 2002, while Bianchi is serving his sentence in a Washington state penitentiary.</p>

It is believed to have been dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles and landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. This rare object provides a significant dataset for scientists studying Mars and is a remarkable find for collectors of cosmic artifacts.</p>

The fossil, a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago, was found in a core sample from a hole drilled over 750 feet deep for a geothermal study. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon. The hockey-puck-shaped fossil is now on display, offering a unique story of scientific serendipity at a beloved institution.</p>

The Trump administration has implemented restrictions on national security grounds, significantly impacting Nvidia's sales to China.

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning once again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds in an accident. The return of the iconic landmark was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display from the cabaret's roof. The original collapse in April 2024 was caused by a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed in time for the Olympics, delays with a new motor kept them stationary. The restoration brings a beloved symbol of Parisian nightlife back to its full, animated glory for the 600,000 visitors it attracts annually.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for creating the perfect political slogan by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. The research suggests that eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—resonate most effectively with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. These words act as "emotional shortcuts," helping to build memorable and impactful messages like "Putting People First" or "It's Time." While not a guarantee of victory, the analysis provides insight into the linguistic building blocks of successful political communication in an era of increasingly sophisticated, AI-driven messaging.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea, the country with the world's lowest birth rate, is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. This trend is attributed to a generational shift, with more people choosing to delay parenthood for social and financial reasons and then turning to medical technology like IVF to start families later in life. While the nation's demographic crisis remains severe, the growing demand for fertility services offers a sign that the desire for children persists among many South Koreans.</p>

The company has already factored tariffs into its financial guidance and is working with its vendors and managing its own costs to protect consumers from price increases.
