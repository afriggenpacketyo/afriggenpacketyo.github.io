          <p>The Trump administration announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which reportedly includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and significant purchases of American goods. President Trump stated Indonesia committed to buying $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. However, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed a positive discussion but did not verify the specific terms of the agreement. This development follows a similar pattern to a recent trade announcement with Vietnam, where details remained unconfirmed by the foreign government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by strong demand for AI-related chips. However, the company issued cautious guidance, forecasting third-quarter revenue below estimates and expressing uncertainty about its growth prospects for 2026 due to macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. ASML, a critical player in the global chip supply chain, narrowed its 2025 sales growth forecast to 15%. The mixed outlook reflects the broader industry's struggle with uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 95th MLB All-Star Game was decided by a novel home run "swing-off" after a 6-6 tie, with Dodgers third base coach Dino Ebel playing a pivotal role. Ebel, a batting practice specialist, pitched to the National League hitters during the tiebreaker, which functions like a penalty shootout. His steady pitches enabled Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber to hit three consecutive home runs, securing a 4-3 swing-off victory and the overall win for the NL. The dramatic conclusion, a first in All-Star history, was praised for bringing new excitement to the event.</p>

          <p>China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, are forecast to hit a record high this year, driven by the launch of new plants and caution regarding U.S. propane and ethane supplies.
