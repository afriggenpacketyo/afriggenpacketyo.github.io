          <p>According to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has fallen for the fifth consecutive week, now standing at 6.67%. With experts anticipating a potential Federal Reserve rate cut later in the year, prospective buyers are advised to prepare for a potentially more competitive market. Key recommendations include checking and improving one's credit score to qualify for better rates and researching experienced real estate agents. Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is also highlighted as a crucial step to demonstrate financial readiness to sellers and stand out among other buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nissan has issued a recall for more than 480,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada because of a manufacturing defect that could cause the engine to fail while driving. The recall affects several popular models, including the Altima, Rogue, and Infiniti QX50, equipped with specific turbo engines where bearing failures may occur. The company notes that drivers might receive advance warning of the issue through abnormal engine noise or dashboard warning lights. Dealers will inspect the affected vehicles and, if necessary, repair or replace the engine at no cost to the owner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India has taken firm control over England, largely thanks to a monumental score of 267 from captain Shubman Gill. His performance anchored India's first-innings total of 587. In response, England's top order collapsed, leaving them at 77-3 by the close of day two, with key batsmen Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope dismissed on consecutive deliveries. This leaves England facing a monumental task to avoid defeat and stay competitive in the match. India's bowlers found more movement than their English counterparts, compounding the pressure on the home side.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old American woman, Aleese Lightyear, has found a dramatically improved quality of life after moving from New York City to Chengdu, China. Formerly working long hours in TV production for $100,000 a year and living paycheck to paycheck, she now earns about $30,000 as a university teacher. In China, this salary allows her to "live large," save up to $1,000 a month, and work only 18 hours a week, giving her time for hobbies and travel. Despite challenges like culture shock and standing out as a woman of color, she reports feeling safer and more confident than she did in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon reflects on his strong season, where he has consistently outperformed his highly-rated teammate, Carlos Sainz. Albon attributes his performance not to a change in his own approach, but to having a car that suits his driving style, drawing a parallel to how athletes in other sports perform better with the right equipment. He also discusses the mental side of the sport, which he works on with his partner, a professional golfer, and a shared psychologist. Looking ahead, Albon is realistic about his team's journey, stating that while he expects continued progress, he believes 2028 is a more realistic target for Williams to be fighting at the front of the grid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000 against their home's equity, the choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) currently presents similar initial costs. With average interest rates for both products hovering around 8.26%, the monthly payments are nearly identical. However, the key difference lies in their rate structures; home equity loans have a fixed rate, ensuring predictable payments, while HELOCs have variable rates that can change over time. This means that while a HELOC could become cheaper if market rates fall, it also carries the risk of becoming more expensive if rates rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans support raising the minimum age for consuming alcohol, currently set at 14 for beer and wine under parental supervision. The poll also found that just over half of respondents want the legal age for purchasing beer and wine to be increased from 16 to 18. These findings come as German health organizations and politicians express growing concern over the health risks of alcohol consumption among young people. German health ministers are currently pushing to eliminate the supervised drinking rule for 14-year-olds, citing alcohol as a significant problem for children and teenagers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market began the second half of the year with record-setting performance, as both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit multiple all-time highs. The tech sector led the charge, with Nvidia's market capitalization surging to nearly $3.9 trillion. This rally continues a strong comeback from an April sell-off, with the Nasdaq posting its best quarterly gain since 2020. A stronger-than-expected June jobs report showed economic resilience, though it may temper arguments for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Following the Fed's stress tests, several major banks also announced dividend increases, further boosting market confidence. (not investment advice)</p>
