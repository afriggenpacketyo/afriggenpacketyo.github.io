          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has reaffirmed his support for lowering interest rates but emphasized the need for a cautious and deliberate approach. Speaking on CNBC, Waller highlighted conflicting economic signals, such as a potentially weakening labor market alongside strong GDP growth and persistent inflation. He suggested that the central bank should avoid aggressive or rapid cuts to prevent policy mistakes, indicating a preference for a gradual pace of two more quarter-point reductions by the end of the year, allowing for adjustments as more economic data becomes available.

          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant mistake young investors make is prioritizing wealth preservation over wealth accumulation. He argues that young people should focus on growth by being fully invested in the stock market, rather than holding significant amounts in cash or bonds. Given their long time horizon, they can afford to take on the volatility of stocks, which have historically outperformed other asset classes, allowing the power of compounding to build substantial wealth over several decades. For beginners, he recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco has discreetly grown into a formidable force in the clothing retail sector, with its annual apparel sales increasing by nearly 40% to $9.7 billion between 2019 and 2024. This figure surpasses the sales of established apparel retailers like Old Navy and Abercrombie & Fitch. The company's success is attributed to its strategy of offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label and making opportunistic purchases that create a "treasure hunt" shopping experience. This growth has positioned Costco as a serious competitor, even leading to legal challenges from brands like Lululemon over product similarities.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in cryptocurrency values has created approximately 70,000 new millionaires in the past year, with the total number now estimated at over 240,000. A new economic study indicates that these crypto investors tend to spend about 9.7 cents of every dollar gained, more than double the rate of those with stock market or real estate gains. This increased spending, estimated at $145 billion in 2024, has primarily gone towards restaurants, entertainment, and real estate. However, many long-term crypto holders are reportedly choosing to hold their assets, anticipating further price increases rather than immediately liquidating for large purchases.

          <p>The initial phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas has commenced, centered on a 72-hour ceasefire and a significant exchange. During this period, Hamas is expected to release 20 living Israeli hostages, while Israel will release approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza. The agreement also includes a substantial increase in humanitarian aid, with about 600 trucks expected to enter Gaza daily. A U.S.-overseen multinational force will monitor the ceasefire as Israeli troops withdraw to control about 53% of the territory, setting the stage for negotiations on subsequent, more complex phases of the plan.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is officially in effect, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along newly established deployment lines as part of the agreement's first phase. In conjunction with these movements, the U.S. Central Command is setting up a coordination center in Israel, staffed by 200 U.S. servicemembers, to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid. This center will provide expertise in logistics, security, and planning, but U.S. officials have emphasized that no American military personnel will be deployed on the ground in Gaza itself.</p>

          <p>The National Basketball Association is making a significant return to China with preseason games in Macao, signaling a renewed effort to rebuild its relationship in its second-largest market. The league's presence in China was severely curtailed after a 2019 political controversy, but it is now aiming to re-engage with its massive Chinese fanbase of over 425 million social media followers. As part of this push, the NBA has renewed a partnership with Alibaba and continues to invest in local retail and community outreach. This strategy aims to unlock future growth as traditional TV viewership declines in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This decision follows a nine-month investigation that concluded Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power." While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation means the CMA can now impose conduct requirements on Google to ensure fair competition. Potential interventions, to be discussed later this year, could include mandating fairer search rankings and giving publishers more control over their content, including its use in AI-powered search results.</p>

          <p>A provision in the Secure 2.0 Act is set to change how high-earning individuals make "catch-up contributions" to their 401(k) plans. Starting in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make these additional contributions—for those age 50 and over—on a post-tax Roth basis. This eliminates the option for an upfront traditional pretax deduction for this group. Financial advisors suggest that affected individuals should begin planning now, weighing whether to maximize pretax contributions before the rule takes effect or to embrace Roth savings sooner.</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, an organization affiliated with Columbia University, has achieved a significant legal victory against the Trump administration's actions targeting pro-Palestinian student activists. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of several students, including Columbia's Mahmoud Khalil, was unconstitutional and intended to suppress free speech. This defiant stance contrasts sharply with Columbia University's own more conciliatory approach to the administration, which included settling antisemitism claims. The case highlights the institute's role as a key defender of constitutional principles at a time when its host university is perceived as compromising them.</p>

Under coach Sebastián Beccacece, the team has developed a resilient, defense-first identity, conceding only five goals throughout the entire qualifying campaign. This success is built on a foundation of strong domestic youth development programs, particularly at clubs like Independiente del Valle, which have produced a new generation of European-based stars like Moisés Caicedo and Piero Hincapié.

Skyy had previously left his first college team mid-season to help care for his father, a former professional football player.
