          <p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh addressed the Supreme Court's increased use of its emergency docket, defending the practice as a necessary response to presidents increasingly using executive orders. He noted that as executive power expands, legal challenges requiring swift judicial intervention naturally follow. Kavanaugh also commented on the court's internal processes, stating that they have evolved to better handle these urgent cases, and emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices despite differing opinions. He acknowledged public criticism as an inherent part of the job for judges.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the newly announced U.S. tariff schedule, which for many included lower rates than initially feared. Leaders from Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments, viewing the reduced duties as beneficial for their economies and reflective of strong bilateral ties. Taiwan's president noted the new 20% rate is temporary pending further negotiations, while Malaysia's prime minister indicated the revised tariffs would not burden the country's economy. Japan welcomed the reduced uncertainty but continues to push for confirmation on lower auto tariffs, highlighting a general sense of cautious optimism across the region.</p>

Quarterback Trey Lance, competing for the backup role, delivered a strong performance, completing 13 of 20 passes for 120 yards and two touchdowns. Other notable takeaways included a 46-yard interception return by rookie cornerback Nikko Reed and a first look at the league's new virtual first-down measurement system.

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, some of whom have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for decades. In her order, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the termination decisions were "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus. The judge scheduled a hearing for November to further review the case.</p>

          <p>The White House is planning to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long desired to accommodate large-scale events. The new building, which will replace the current East Wing, is estimated to cost $200 million and will be funded by the president and other "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony in 1948. President Trump noted the current reliance on outdoor tents for large gatherings is impractical, and he views the new ballroom as "his gift to the country."</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a massive 250% stock price increase on its first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. This has created approximately $24 billion in collective paper wealth for its four main venture capital backers: Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. The blockbuster debut is a significant positive event for the tech IPO market, which has been largely dormant for several years. The success is particularly notable as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was blocked last year by regulators on competition grounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Discover Potato Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor Through Hybridization</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the journal *Cell* reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species. Scientists solved the long-standing puzzle by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a gene from the ancient tomato gave the plant the ability to form tubers, while a gene from the other wild parent helped control their growth. The findings demonstrate how hybridization between different species can give rise to entirely new traits and spur the emergence of new species.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC is facing a critical match against Mexican club Pachuca in the 2025 Leagues Cup tournament. After a disappointing penalty shootout loss to Mazatlán in their opening game, LAFC must secure a victory to keep its hopes of advancing to the quarterfinals alive. Coach Steve Cherundolo is expected to field his starting lineup after resting key players in the first match. Pachuca enters the game with momentum after a 3-2 victory over San Diego. The tournament's format, which only advances four teams from each league, makes every point crucial for survival.</p>

          <p>Apple announced a 10% year-over-year revenue increase in its third fiscal quarter, surpassing analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings. The strong performance was driven by record sales for the iPhone and growth in the services division. Despite the positive financial results, the company provided little new information on its long-term artificial intelligence strategy, which has become a key focus for investors. While CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the company's significant investment in AI, the lack of a clear roadmap has tempered investor enthusiasm for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument at the state capitol to honor an individual African American, joining statues of white men, many with ties to the Confederacy. The project, made possible by a bipartisan push from state lawmakers, is seen by historians as a step toward completing the state's historical narrative. The statue is being created by artist Basil Watson.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, driven by strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising divisions. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to investor disappointment with the growth rate of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit, which was only slightly ahead of forecasts. The company's third-quarter operating income guidance also came in below expectations. Management attributed ongoing AI-related supply constraints, particularly access to power, as a challenge for AWS, while also planning for increased capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>
