          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers have been convicted of criminal damage for cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland National Park in September 2023. The tree, famous for its picturesque location along Hadrian‚Äôs Wall and appearance in the film ‚ÄúRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves,‚Äù was felled in what prosecutors called a deliberate act of vandalism. Digital evidence, including a video on Graham‚Äôs phone, placed the men at the scene. Both men are held in custody and face a lengthy prison sentence, with sentencing scheduled for July 15. The senseless act has caused immense grief to locals and tourists alike, with the tree being a landmark for over a century. The tree was valued at over $830,000, with damage to the wall estimated at nearly $1,500.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to consider a tax increase on wealthy Americans, a move that deviates from traditional Republican tax policies. In a Truth Social post, Trump stated he would "graciously" accept a tax increase for the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but he also acknowledged the potential political challenges and backlash from Democrats. He referenced George H.W. Bush's broken promise not to raise taxes and suggested Republicans should probably not pursue the idea. This public deliberation highlights the ongoing debate within the Republican party regarding tax policies and economic strategies.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid is reportedly preparing for a transition as Carlo Ancelotti is expected to depart and potentially take on the Brazil job. Ancelotti's relationship with club president Florentino Perez has become strained, partly due to disagreements over player acquisitions and managing internal tensions, including a rivalry between Vinicius and Mbappe. Xabi Alonso is being considered as a potential successor, with Ancelotti seeking a payoff from Real Madrid for letting him go before his contract expires in 2026. Assistant coach Davide Ancelotti is also expected to pursue a head coaching role at another club.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a former Supreme Court Justice appointed by George H.W. Bush, has died at the age of 85. Souter, a New Hampshire Republican, became a key member of the court's liberal wing during his 19 years on the bench, often disappointing conservatives. Known for his preference for a quiet life in New Hampshire, Souter retired at 69, giving Barack Obama his first Supreme Court vacancy. His jurisprudence emphasized the Constitution as a charter of ordered liberty, evolving over time, and he valued the role of the courts in ensuring a just society.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere after failing to reach Venus due to a rocket malfunction. Experts predict the spacecraft, weighing over 1,000 pounds, could crash anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While the risk of it hitting someone is low, experts warn that the spacecraft could reenter intact if its heat shield holds, posing a threat as a half-ton metal object falling from the sky. The incident highlights growing concerns about space debris and its potential impact on aircraft and populated areas.</p>

The move comes after Trump claimed Afrikaners are victims of racial persecution in South Africa. The South African government has disputed the claim that Afrikaners qualify for refugee status. The rapid processing of Afrikaner cases contrasts with the long wait times faced by other refugees. Critics argue the move is politically motivated and highlights the administration's inaction on other refugees.</p>

          <p>The White House is expected to send Congress a rescissions package, seeking to claw back congressionally approved funding amid efforts to slash spending. The package is expected to ask Congress to cancel around $9 billion, seeking to make permanent some of the spending that Elon Musk and Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency have slashed in recent months. The recission package would likely be only a fraction of the cuts, with an expected focus on foreign aid money from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with funding for major public broadcasting systems, including NPR and PBS.

The approval comes after a study confirmed self-collected samples using the device perform as accurately as clinician-collected samples. Teal Health said the kits will be available for shipping in June, starting in California and then expanding nationwide.

Scientists believe this ability to produce rhythm predates humans. The analysis of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps play their instruments with regular rhythms. Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.

Souter was appointed by George HW Bush in 1990, and quickly dashed the expectations of the conservative right that had cheered his elevation.

          <p>Many liberals believe the Democratic Party should prioritize climate change to win elections, but evidence suggests voters, including young ones, don't see it as a top priority. While younger voters are more concerned about climate change, their main focus remains the economy and jobs. Voters are aware that Democrats prioritize climate, but this hasn't translated into electoral success. Focusing more on climate could perpetuate the idea that Democrats don't share ordinary Americans' priorities and risk undermining their standing on the cost of living. To make progress on climate, Democrats need to remove the GOP from power, but rhetorical focus on climate may conflict with that goal.</p>

          <p>Jury selection for Sean Combs‚Äôs racketeering and sexual assault trial was delayed on Friday due to concerns that jurors might grow uneasy before the trial begins on Monday. Judge Arun Subramanian cited the need to ensure jurors remain committed. The trial involves allegations of violence and financial manipulation to coerce women into drug-fueled encounters, which Combs denies. Jurors will be anonymous and not sequestered. The trial is expected to last eight weeks, and the selection process involves screening potential jurors for bias and exposure to the case.</p>
