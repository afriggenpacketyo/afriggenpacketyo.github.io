          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a way to mitigate turbulence in Hyperloop systems, potentially salvaging vacuum-tube maglev technology. The study found that even minor imperfections in the track would cause violent low-frequency vibrations at high speeds. Researchers have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more comfortable. This research could address challenges faced by Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CDC will no longer advise that healthy children receive routine COVID-19 shots, a change from its previous recommendation for annual shots for everyone 6 months and older. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited a lack of data supporting shots for healthy children and pregnant women, echoing his skepticism about the need to vaccinate children against the virus. While many agree that the original vaccination course offered significant protection against serious illness in children, the question of whether children need annual vaccines is more contentious. Doctors said the question comes down to how families make sense of the risk to their children.</p>
