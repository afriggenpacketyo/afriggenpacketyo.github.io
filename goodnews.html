          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has significantly evolved from its origins as the "Shanghai Five," a small group focused on border security in 1996. Now comprising 26 countries, including full members, observers, and dialogue partners, the bloc has become a major Eurasian organization addressing security, economic, and diplomatic issues. Key milestones include its official renaming and expansion in 2001 with Uzbekistan's entry and the signing of the SCO Charter in 2002. The organization continues to attract new members, with nations like Myanmar and Turkey seeking full membership.</p>

          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "America’s Team: the Gambler and his Cowboys," is being lauded for its raw and comprehensive portrayal of the Dallas Cowboys' dynasty in the 1990s. The series delves into the team's on-field success and off-field controversies, including drug use and internal conflicts, offering a grittier alternative to more sanitized sports documentaries like "The Last Dance." Featuring candid interviews with key figures like owner Jerry Jones, coach Jimmy Johnson, and star player Michael Irvin, the documentary explores the complex dynamics and personal struggles behind their three Super Bowl wins. The review highlights the film's success in revealing deeper truths about the players and the era.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. This decision aligns with the club's long-term "Project 150" strategy, which aims to build a title-winning team by the club's 150th anniversary in 2028. While Martinez is a proven Premier League and World Cup winner, United's data analysis highlighted Lammens' exceptional potential in key metrics like shot-stopping and distribution. The move is considered a risk due to Lammens' relative inexperience, but it reflects the club's new focus on building for the future.</p>

          <h2>Strong Solar Storm Makes Northern Lights Visible Across the United Kingdom</h2>

          <p>The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, were visible across large parts of the United Kingdom, from northern Scotland down to Norfolk and Kent. The rare spectacle was caused by a strong solar storm, resulting from a coronal mass ejection on the Sun's surface. This increased solar energy interacted with gases in Earth's atmosphere to create the vibrant display of colors. Forecasters at the Met Office Space Weather Centre suggest that the heightened solar activity could continue, potentially increasing the chances of the aurora being visible again across the entire country.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing after no ticket matched all the winning numbers on Monday night. This new grand prize now ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history and could grow even larger before the drawing. The current jackpot has been accumulating for 41 consecutive drawings since it was last won in California on May 31. A single winner would have the option of a lump-sum cash payment of approximately $589 million before taxes or an annuity paid out over 30 years.</p>

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin showcased China's efforts to build a new global security and economic framework as a challenge to U.S. influence. President Xi Jinping criticized the "shadows of Cold War mentality" in a veiled reference to U.S. trade policies. Key outcomes from the summit include a notable thawing in India-China relations, a symbolic display of unity between Xi, Russia's Putin, and India's Modi, and a renewed commitment to cooperate on artificial intelligence. Additionally, some member states agreed to explore creating an SCO development bank to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of steep new U.S. port fees scheduled for October, Chinese shipping companies are collaborating with global partners to lessen their exposure to the American market. Firms like Cosco Shipping Holdings are strategically expanding services in emerging and regional markets, such as intra-Asia and routes to Africa and Latin America. This pivot is a response to what the industry sees as an "unprecedented historical evolution" driven by geopolitical and trade tensions. By leveraging alliances, these companies aim to navigate the financial pressures and explore new growth opportunities away from the turbulent transpacific routes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Utah is grappling with a severe housing affordability crisis, prompting Governor Spencer Cox to set a goal of building 35,000 starter homes within five years. However, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. The state has offered incentives like low-interest construction loans, but builders have been hesitant to participate, and lawmakers have resisted bolder zoning reforms like eliminating minimum lot sizes. Despite these challenges, some developers are embracing the initiative, creating more affordable homes for first-time buyers, though prices remain high relative to just a few years ago.</p>

          <p>A research team in Beijing has designed a potential solution for washing clothes in space: a compact, detergent-free washing machine that uses mist and ozone. The device, developed at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre, weighs 12kg and uses only 400ml of water per cycle to clean clothes. Instead of soap, it uses ultrasonic atomization to create a fine mist and ultraviolet light to generate ozone, a powerful disinfectant. This innovation addresses the long-standing challenge of laundry on long-duration space missions, where water is a scarce and precious resource.</p>
