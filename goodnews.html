          <p>Former NFL star Boomer Esiason has criticized Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams for his alleged attempts to avoid being drafted by the team, as detailed in a new biography, according to a Fox News article. Esiason expressed disbelief at Williams's "level of entitlement," suggesting it contributed to initial failures and the coach's subsequent firing. He advised Williams to focus on playing football and earning respect in the league. Williams, who was eventually drafted by the Bears, has not commented on the book's details but expressed excitement about the hiring of a new offensive coach.</p>
