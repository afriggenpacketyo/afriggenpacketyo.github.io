          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, released despite the government shutdown, showed that annual inflation was 3.0% in September, slightly lower than economists had forecasted. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also came in below expectations with a 0.2% monthly increase. This data is the last significant economic indicator the Federal Reserve will see before its next policy meeting. The softer inflation reading has solidified market expectations that the central bank will proceed with another interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

He also highlighted GE Vernova as a "rocket ship" stock, believing it is well-positioned to meet the growing energy infrastructure demands driven by the artificial intelligence boom. While bullish on these specific names, Cramer cautioned that the broader market might be approaching overbought conditions, as indicated by his S&P Oscillator metric. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of his 300th appearance for Manchester United, team captain Bruno Fernandes has affirmed his commitment to the club, stating he will not entertain discussions about his future until after the next World Cup. The Portuguese midfielder revealed he rejected a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal during the summer. Fernandes emphasized that his primary motivation is to achieve team success and win trophies with Manchester United, a goal he feels he has not yet accomplished since joining the club in 2020.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, has won a significant by-election in the Caerphilly constituency, defeating both the far-right Reform UK party and the incumbent Labour Party. The result is a major blow to Labour, which had held the seat in the Welsh parliament (Senedd) since its inception in 1999. It is also a setback for Reform UK, which had invested heavily in the campaign hoping to win its first Senedd seat. Plaid Cymru's leader hailed the victory as a sign that the party is now the "real choice for Wales."</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced that benefits will increase by 2.8% in 2026, reflecting the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This will translate to an average monthly increase of approximately $56 for Social Security retirement beneficiaries, starting in January. The COLA is calculated based on an inflation index to help the purchasing power of benefits keep up with rising prices for the nearly 75 million Americans who receive them. However, this increase may be partially offset by anticipated hikes in Medicare Part B premiums.</p>

          <p>A lakeside villa once owned by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, which has been decaying and unused for over two decades, is being repurposed to host guided tours and events. The state of Berlin, which owns the property and has struggled with its high maintenance costs, has temporarily transferred the site to the local municipality of Wandlitz. This decision represents a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of how to handle former Nazi sites, aiming to prevent both their demolition and their potential use as pilgrimage sites for extremists.</p>

          <p>This article serves as a fact-check, explaining why directly comparing sexual assault statistics between different countries is a flawed and misleading practice. A viral graphic claiming the UK has an exponentially higher rate of sexual assault than other European nations fails to account for critical differences in legal definitions, crime recording practices, and cultural attitudes toward reporting. Criminologists cited in the article argue that police-reported data is not a reliable measure of prevalence and that victim surveys offer a more accurate, though still complex, picture.</p>

          <p>This article explores the question of how much a person needs to owe before a debt collector is likely to file a lawsuit. While there is no definitive minimum amount, legal action often becomes a practical consideration for unsecured debts in the range of $1,000 to $5,000. For smaller balances, the costs associated with litigation can make a lawsuit unprofitable for the collection agency. The decision also depends heavily on state laws, the type of debt, and the practices of the specific court system.</p>

          <p>In a reflective essay, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro explains the deep personal and artistic motivations behind his upcoming adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." He posits that the horror genre serves as one of the last bastions of spirituality in a material world, allowing for the exploration of profound existential questions. Del Toro sees the novel as a powerful parable about abandonment, the sorrow of a creation without a caring god, and the search for truth, themes that have resonated with him since childhood and echo in his other works.</p>

          <p>A new paleogenomic study has identified previously unknown diseases that contributed to the destruction of Napoleon's army during its disastrous 1812 retreat from Russia. By analyzing ancient DNA extracted from the teeth of soldiers found in a mass grave in Lithuania, researchers discovered evidence of bacteria causing paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever. These findings add to the previously known afflictions of typhus and trench fever, painting a more complete picture of the multiple microbial assaults that, along with starvation and freezing temperatures, annihilated the Grande Armee.</p>
