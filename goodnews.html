          <p>Prince Harry was observed entering Clarence House, sparking widespread speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, who had also arrived at the residence earlier from Scotland. This highly anticipated encounter marks their first face-to-face interaction since February 2024, following the King's cancer diagnosis, and comes as Harry has publicly voiced a desire for family reconciliation. The Duke of Sussex is currently in the UK for a series of charity engagements, with his family remaining in the US. While the palace has not confirmed the meeting, this development offers a glimmer of hope for mending the strained relationship between father and son, particularly after Harry's previous expressions of frustration over not being able to speak with his father during health concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump's unprecedented attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. The judge stated that Trump had not provided a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal, as the allegations of mortgage fraud cited by the president pertained to her conduct before joining the Fed and remain unproven. This decision underscores the critical importance of safeguarding the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, a principle essential for maintaining the stability of the U.S. financial system. Cook's legal team successfully argued that her due process rights were violated and that her dismissal would set a dangerous precedent for the central bank's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Uber is significantly expanding its transportation offerings by integrating helicopter services directly into its ride-sharing platform through a new partnership with Joby Aviation, a developer of electric air taxis. This innovative collaboration, expected to launch as early as next year, will enable users in major global cities to book flights within the Uber app, marking a strategic move into aerial mobility. The initiative follows Joby's recent acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, a company with established helicopter and seaplane operations. Although specific routes and pricing details are yet to be revealed, the primary goal is to provide convenient and efficient airport connections, with future plans to transition to quiet, zero-emissions electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has acquitted Choi Mal-ja, 79, six decades after she was convicted for causing grievous bodily harm while defending herself against sexual assault. In 1964, at age 19, Choi bit off part of her attacker's tongue after he pinned her down and assaulted her. While her attacker received a suspended sentence for trespassing, Choi was convicted and given a 10-month suspended prison sentence. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi challenged the ruling, with the Busan District Court now declaring her actions "justifiable self-defense." This landmark decision overturns her 1965 conviction and paves the way for her to seek state compensation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation, unexpectedly declined by 0.1% in August, marking the third instance of deflation this year. This tame reading is intensifying market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week, with President Trump publicly criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not acting sooner. While the PPI is not as high-profile as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), its underlying drivers showed positive signs, with the services sector experiencing deflation. All eyes are now on Thursday's CPI report, which will be the final major data point before the Fed's crucial rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has discovered compelling evidence in a dry river channel that may indicate ancient microscopic life on the red planet. Scientists reported finding organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide within reddish, clay-rich mudstones. On Earth, these chemical compounds are often byproducts of microbial activity on organic matter. While stressing the need for in-depth analysis on Earth-based labs, researchers consider this the most compelling candidate yet in the search for past Martian life. The findings, published in Nature, represent a significant step in answering whether humanity is alone in the universe, despite challenges in the sample return mission.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has issued an executive order banning the sale of THC products to minors and mandating stricter regulations for the consumable hemp industry. This action bypasses legislative deadlock, as lawmakers failed to pass similar measures despite the issue being on two special session agendas. The order directs state health and alcoholic beverage agencies to implement stricter labeling, testing, record-keeping, and increased licensing fees to support enforcement. While some retailers already check IDs, this order establishes a formal age restriction, aiming to protect children and ensure product safety, though some critics advocate for a complete ban on synthetic cannabinoids.</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge in autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university" under the proposed name London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by England's higher education regulator, aims to provide a strong financial foundation amid economic challenges facing the sector, with 40% of English universities currently in deficit. While vice-chancellors insist it's not a takeover or driven by crisis, the University and College Union predicts "almost certainly" redundancies. The new institution will serve nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded under individual university names, and is seen as a trailblazing model for collaboration.</p>

In Europe, Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk saw shares rise despite announcing job cuts, while Zara owner Inditex gained 6.5% after strong first-half earnings and positive sales momentum for its new collections. Investors also monitored reports of President Trump's request for the EU to impose tariffs on China and India over Russian oil purchases, raising global trade concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates has committed $50 million to research women's health issues, as part of her larger $1 billion pledge over two years. This funding, channeled through Wellcome Leap, will focus on conditions disproportionately affecting women, such as autoimmune diseases, mental health, and cardiovascular disease, where women often experience worse outcomes due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. The initiative addresses a historical chronic underfunding in women's health research, which has long treated men's bodies as the default in medical studies. Closing this health gap is seen not only as a moral imperative but also as a potential economic boon, estimated to add $1 trillion to the global economy annually by 2040.</p>
