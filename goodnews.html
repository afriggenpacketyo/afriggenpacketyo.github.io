          <h2>Democrats Should Prioritize Policy Over Messaging, Argues Vox Columnist</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent Vox article, Eric Levitz argues that Democrats should focus more on policy than messaging, particularly regarding abundance reforms like easing zoning restrictions and environmental review laws. He contends that while populist rhetoric may be more politically resonant, the material benefits of abundance policies are more important for the party's long-term success. Levitz points to governance failures in blue states, such as housing shortages and infrastructure project delays, as evidence that Democrats need to prioritize policies that deliver tangible results. He suggests that Democrats can pursue both abundance liberalism and populism without inherent conflict, as policies that increase economic growth can provide more wealth to redistribute.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major international trial has demonstrated that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can reduce the risk of dying by a third. The three-year program, which started soon after chemotherapy, aimed to get people doing at least double the amount of exercise recommended for the general population. After five years, 80% of people exercising remained cancer-free, compared to 74% in the group given only health advice. Researchers are investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer, with the results potentially changing how colon cancer is treated worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vogue argues that the word 'chic' has lost its meaning, becoming overused and co-opted to describe trends promoted by influencers, rather than representing unique style. The author suggests rehabilitating alternative words like 'snazzy,' 'trendy,' and 'swish' to diversify language and make life more interesting. Despite the call for change, the author acknowledges that 'chic' is deeply ingrained and likely to persist. The author also mentioned that they would like to see the return of ‚Äúsnazzy‚Äù, ‚Äútrendy‚Äù, ‚Äúswish‚Äù, and other dad-jectives; and for influencers to start calling their baby-blue crocodile Herm√®s handbags ‚Äújazzy‚Äù.</p>

          <p>BTG Pactual, a Brazilian investment bank, is considering expanding its operations in Asia by opening a new office in Hong Kong. This move is driven by the increasing demand for data centers among Chinese AI firms and the growing trade and investment ties between China and Brazil. BTG executives recently toured major Chinese cities with a delegation of Brazilian entrepreneurs and family offices. The potential revival of BTG's Hong Kong office aligns with a recent pledge by China and Brazil to enhance their bilateral relationship amid global trade challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A guide to 13 California native plants with vibrant flowers that can bring color to gardens, particularly during the summer when many native plants go dormant. The recommendations are grouped by color and prime flowering season, and include suggestions from experts in the native plant world. The list includes California goldenrod, desert marigold, California buckwheat, Coulter‚Äôs Matilija Poppy, Hollywood Flame Hummingbird Fuchsia, desert globemallow, island pink yarrow, woolly bluecurls, celestial blue sage, coyote mint, showy Penstemon, brittlebush, and Pacific Coast irises. It is important to note that the best time to plant native shrubs and perennials is in the fall, so the plants have time to settle in during our typically cooler and wet winters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is moving towards mandating phonics-based reading instruction in schools, a significant shift after decades of debate and controversy. A bill moving through the Legislature would require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading," which emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. This change comes amid persistently low reading scores in the state. Several districts, including Los Angeles Unified and Long Beach Unified, have already started to embrace more structured phonics learning, and are beginning to see improvements in test scores.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign flight paths over UK airspace, many of which were established 70 years ago. The plan aims to modernize flight paths, allowing planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, which could lead to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The plans are also intended to help reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. However, community aviation groups have warned that the plans could mean new flight paths over houses that are not currently affected.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will increase military spending, build new nuclear-powered attack submarines, and create an army prepared for European warfare, in an effort to send a strong message to Moscow and President Trump. The government aims to respond to a strategic defense review with the goal of transforming the country's military and addressing growing threats on land, air, sea, and in cyberspace. The plans include increasing weapons stockpiles and establishing a cyber command, with defense spending set to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and potentially 3% before 2034. This move signals Britain's commitment to its own defense and its willingness to address Trump's call for NATO members to increase their defense spending.</p>
