          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has elected conservative hard-liner Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a former economic security minister and an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, defeated Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. She advocates for strengthening Japan's military and adopting a more assertive stance toward China and North Korea. Her leadership comes as the party seeks to regain public support, and she may soon face a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss defense spending.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an extraordinary endurance project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just over a month. The project, called "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling between the peaks and running up each one, covering over 3,000 miles across six states. The article chronicles the journey, highlighting Jornet's minimalist approach and profound connection with nature, framing his feats not just as record-setting but as an artistic expression of movement through wilderness. His motivation was driven by a desire to explore new landscapes and test the limits of human physiology.</p>

It highlights the Curie family's five-prize dynasty and Albert Einstein's divorce settlement, where he promised his future Nobel prize money to his wife. The piece also delves into controversies, such as Einstein never winning for his theory of relativity and the historical overlooking of female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin. Additionally, it notes that prizes have been awarded for science later debunked, such as the lobotomy, and have never been revoked.</p>

          <p>The 1990s BBC documentary "Premier Passions," which chronicled Sunderland's dramatic 1996-97 relegation season, is remembered for its unprecedented behind-the-scenes access. Former manager Peter Reid looks back on the series, known for his expletive-laden team talks, acknowledging that such behavior would likely be unacceptable today but was part of the era's football culture. The article explores how the documentary captured a pivotal moment for the club as it moved from its historic Roker Park to the new Stadium of Light. It provided a raw look at the pressures of top-flight football, boardroom dealings, and the heartbreak of relegation on the final day.</p>

Takaichi, an ally of former PM Shinzo Abe, supports his “Abenomics” policies and has a nationalist stance, criticizing China's military expansion and regularly visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine. She has also expressed conservative views on social issues, such as opposing changes to surname laws for married couples. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025 is set to appear this week, marking the beginning of three consecutive supermoons for the year. This full moon, known as the Harvest Moon because it is the closest to the autumn equinox, will be the largest and brightest of the year so far. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter. The article explains the science behind the phenomenon and the origins of its name, noting that it traditionally provided extra light for farmers gathering crops.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why Donald Trump Embraced Hamas's Ambiguous Peace Plan Response</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 23:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the diplomatic reasoning behind President Donald Trump's decision to accept Hamas's recent response to his Gaza peace plan, despite it not being an unequivocal agreement. The article argues that Trump, a pragmatic deal-maker, saw the commitment to release all hostages as a sufficient basis to declare a breakthrough and pressure Israel to halt military operations. This move is framed as a significant pivot, cornering Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reflecting Trump's desire to end the conflict and secure a major foreign policy win. The Israeli attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar is cited as a key event that angered Trump and shifted his stance.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces rallied in the fourth quarter to defeat the Phoenix Mercury 89-86 in a dramatic opening game of the WNBA finals. Trailing for much of the contest, the Aces launched a decisive 17-6 run late in the game, sparked by a technical foul on Phoenix's Satou Sabally. Four-time MVP A’ja Wilson and reserve guard Dana Evans each scored 21 points, with Wilson delivering 12 in the final period to seal the victory. The game also took place amid tensions between the players' union and WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert over issues of pay and respect, adding an undercurrent of off-court drama to the championship series.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a response to President Trump's Gaza peace proposal, agreeing to key parts such as the release of all hostages but indicating other elements require further negotiation. The U.S. is viewing the response as positive, and Israel has announced it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. Following the statement, President Trump urged Israel to immediately stop its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, declaring his belief that Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." The move signals a potential breakthrough in the nearly two-year-long conflict, with discussions on the remaining details expected to begin soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's biopharmaceutical industry is experiencing a renaissance, marked by a surge in novel drug development that is attracting international recognition. A key example is a cancer drug from a Guangzhou-based biotech firm, which a late-stage trial showed was more effective at delaying lung cancer progression than Merck's blockbuster drug, Keytruda. This success is highlighted as evidence of China's growing prowess in creating innovative medicines, moving beyond its past role as a manufacturer of generic drugs. While significant progress has been made, experts remain watchful to see if the sector can consistently produce true breakthrough innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Morocco is experiencing a wave of youth-led protests, coordinated by a group called "Gen Z 212," demanding the government prioritize essential services like healthcare and education over massive spending on the 2030 World Cup. Demonstrators argue that the reported $5 billion investment in football infrastructure is misplaced when public hospitals and schools are underfunded. The movement, which has spread across multiple cities, was galvanized by the deaths of eight women in a maternity ward, highlighting deficiencies in the healthcare system. Despite a police crackdown and numerous arrests, the leaderless protesters have vowed to continue until they see concrete change.</p>
