          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 07:27:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has withdrawn its demand for Apple to create a "backdoor" into its encrypted services, marking a significant victory for the tech company and global privacy advocates. The decision came after extensive discussions with the U.S. government, which had raised national security concerns about weakening encryption. Governments have long sought access to encrypted data for criminal investigations, but tech companies and cybersecurity experts argue that any backdoor would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, compromising user security. This development may allow Apple to reintroduce its most secure cloud data service, Advanced Data Protection, to its U.K. customers.</p>

          <p>Air Canada's flight attendants have ended their four-day strike after their union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), reached a tentative agreement with the airline. The strike, which began on a Saturday, had disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The union had previously defied two back-to-work orders from the Canada Industrial Relations Board, with union leaders risking fines and jail time to continue negotiations. The dispute centered on pay and compensation for unpaid work performed by flight attendants while planes are on the ground.</p>

          <p>As the back-to-school season begins, many American families are shopping earlier and focusing on essential items to manage costs amid concerns about inflation and tariffs on imported goods. According to the National Retail Federation, families are expected to spend an average of $858, slightly down from last year but significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Prices for typical school supplies have reportedly increased by over 7% this year. To save money, experts recommend comparing prices, considering refurbished electronics, buying store-brand products, and giving teens a budget on a gift card to instill financial discipline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will facilitate a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by trilateral talks involving the U.S. The development aims to build momentum toward ending the war in Ukraine, with recent discussions focusing on security guarantees and the return of Ukrainian prisoners. While Ukraine is pushing for a ceasefire before further negotiations, Russia has expressed its own red lines, including opposition to European troops in Ukraine. This diplomatic effort is unfolding alongside a separate U.S. domestic political battle over mail-in voting.</p>

          <p>Thirty-three years since its inception, the English Premier League (EPL) has transformed into the world's most dominant and wealthiest club soccer league, with its 20 teams generating over $8.5 billion in revenue last season. This financial power allows EPL clubs to attract top international talent, creating a highly competitive environment where outcomes are less predictable than in other top European leagues. Its games are broadcast in 189 countries, fueled by a massive $5.1 billion per season media rights deal. The league's challenge now is to maintain its top position by evolving and avoiding the financial and competitive stagnation that has affected other major leagues.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's First Lady, Olena Zelenska, wrote a letter of gratitude to Melania Trump after she publicly advocated for the protection of Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered the letter to Donald Trump, thanking Melania for raising awareness of the issue. This exchange followed Melania Trump's own letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to consider the children's welfare. The Ukrainian government claims that nearly 20,000 children have been forcibly deported by Russia since 2022, an accusation that has led to an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for Putin.</p>

          <p>American investors, including private equity firms, are increasingly acquiring stakes in top European soccer clubs, drawn by soaring revenues and valuations. In the 2023-24 season, Europe's five biggest leagues generated over €20 billion in revenue, a massive increase from the €2.5 billion they earned when the Premier League was established. This financial growth has made clubs like Manchester United, now valued at around £5 billion, highly attractive assets. U.S. investors now have stakes in a majority of English Premier League teams, often employing a multi-club ownership model to maximize their investment, a practice that is drawing increased scrutiny from regulators.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations, marking the first time it has missed on both metrics in over a decade. Despite this, the company is maintaining its full-year forecast, anticipating a 2.8% growth in total sales. The retailer noted that while homeowners are still showing a "deferral mindset" on large projects due to the sluggish housing market, there are positive signs, including an increase in big-ticket transactions over $1,000. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, focusing instead on its core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Using a $5,100 turf replacement rebate from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, a couple in the Harvard Park neighborhood converted their dead lawn into a thriving, low-water native plant garden. Lexie Glass and Evan Hursley undertook the project themselves, learning from online resources to remove concrete, install drip irrigation, and select a variety of California native plants. Their new landscape, which now serves as an extension of their home with outdoor living spaces, has become a habitat for local wildlife like hummingbirds and bees. The project showcases how homeowners can create sustainable and beautiful oases while conserving water.</p>
