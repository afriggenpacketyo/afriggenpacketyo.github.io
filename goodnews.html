          <p>Japan's jobless rate remained unchanged at 2.5% in April, according to recent reports. This indicates a stable labor market in Japan, despite global economic uncertainties. While the rate has remained consistent, it's important to monitor future trends to assess the long-term health of the Japanese economy. This stability could provide some reassurance to businesses and consumers in Japan amidst broader economic concerns. The report suggests a steady employment situation within the country.</p>

          <p>Cambridge Associates suggests global investors are shifting from US-heavy portfolios to undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China due to geopolitical tensions. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities, particularly in China and Hong Kong, have outperformed US stocks. The Hang Seng Index, with a lower valuation compared to the S&P 500 and Nikkei 225, is attracting interest. This shift is supported by monetary easing and signs of policy coordination between Beijing and Washington, signaling a potentially stronger case for diversifying away from US equities.

The Trump administration has accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus. The court's decision preserves the status quo while both sides confer and submit proposed orders. The uncertainty could lead foreign students in the visa program to flee Harvard, seeking transfers to other universities that are not targeted by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of a significant crypto enforcement action. The original complaint alleged Binance illegally served U.S. users, inflated trading volumes, and commingled customer funds. This dismissal comes as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the crypto industry, with the Justice Department already shutting down its crypto enforcement team. Binance has also deepened its involvement in Pakistan, with Zhao advising the newly formed Crypto Council, a state-backed body. (not investment advice)</p>
