          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the U.S. This move is influenced by the Trump administration's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The investment will enable GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S. by 2027. GM's CEO, Mary Barra, emphasized the company's commitment to American innovation, manufacturing expertise, and job support, aiming to provide customers with a wide range of vehicle choices.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded following a recent feud between Elon Musk and President Trump, driven by renewed optimism regarding Tesla's robotaxi program.

Tesla is expected to launch a pilot program for its driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, utilizing Model Y vehicles with unsupervised Full Self-Driving technology. The stock's recovery also reflects a more conciliatory tone from Musk after the spat with Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's military-civilian fusion strategy, aimed at integrating military and civilian technology, faces challenges primarily due to red tape rather than U.S. sanctions. While Beijing encourages private sector participation in defense orders, state-owned conglomerates have historically dominated the sector. The plan is a central pillar of China's ambition to modernize its military by 2035 and achieve world-class armed forces by 2049. The strategy has become a focal point of the US-China rivalry, leading to sanctions on Chinese companies accused of aiding the PLA.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2, priced at $449.99, offers a worthy successor to the original Switch, focusing on refinement rather than reinvention. It features improvements like magnetically connecting Joy-Cons, a 1080p screen with 4K TV support, and enhanced chat features with an optional camera. While battery life may be a challenge, the console brings brighter, crisper visuals to older games and introduces new features like Joy-Cons that can act as a mouse. The console is launching with the new game "Mario Kart World."</p>

          <p>In a world increasingly saturated with AI-generated content, the ability to discern quality and make meaningful choices is becoming paramount.

AI can generate infinite variations, but lacks the human discretion and emotional resonance to originate style with intentionality. Cultivating taste, therefore, is a competitive advantage and an ethical necessity, guiding choices and ensuring integrity in a world where AI amplifies biases.</p>
