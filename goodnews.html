          <p>This article discusses the benefits of air conditioning, arguing it's more than just a luxury in today's world. Air conditioning saves lives by preventing heat-related deaths, boosts productivity in workplaces and schools, and improves sleep quality. It has also enabled technological advancements like movie theaters and microchips, and has allowed for the development of cities in hot climates, offering people more choices in where they live. The author concludes that better, more efficient air conditioning is needed rather than less, especially as the world warms. The author points out that the choice to use air conditioning should be a personal one.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with failing heart function and an LVAD, received a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, after facing dangerous heart rhythms and high antibody levels, which made finding a matching heart difficult. Dr. Pareg Patel and his team decided on the liver transplant to reduce the antibodies, making her eligible for a heart transplant, a procedure never before done on someone with an LVAD. Baker's surgery was successful, and she was also able to donate her healthy liver to another patient, but she is now facing financial difficulties after her husband's sudden death and ongoing medical expenses. Her story highlights the potential for innovative solutions in transplant medicine and the financial challenges faced by many patients after receiving lifesaving treatments.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, reducing reliance on foreign software and enhancing small satellite performance. The Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat used OpenHarmony for over 1,000 hours of in-orbit testing, demonstrating faster data updates and improved stability. The satellite also ran on a domestically produced chip, achieving a fully home-grown hardware-software solution. Yu Xiaozhou and colleagues are proposing national technical standards to promote the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in Chinese satellite missions.</p>

          <p>This article discusses David Litt's book, "It's Only Drowning," which explores an unlikely friendship between the author, a former Obama speechwriter, and his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. The article highlights the political and cultural divisions in America and how shared activities can bridge those divides. Litt emphasizes the importance of finding neutral ground and moving beyond the idea of common ground, as well as the need for Democrats to connect with working-class voters. He suggests that Democrats should focus on entertainment and shared experiences rather than solely on politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Pip Adam‚Äôs novel 'Audition,' which uses the setting of outer space to explore alternative forms of human connection and escape the prejudices and hierarchies of Earth. The story follows three giants confined on a spaceship, forced to speak to power the ship while their language is corrupted and transformed into a means of exploitation. As they approach a black hole, they realize the shared damage and violence that bonds them, and ultimately find a new world where they can form unheard-of associations and discover unknown pleasures. The review contrasts this vision with the utopian dreams of billionaires like Bezos and Musk, suggesting that true possibility lies beyond the cages that separate and constrain life on Earth.</p>

Zuckerberg's push for AI dominance comes amid fierce competition from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, with Meta facing pressure to improve its AI models and capitalize on advertising targeting opportunities.
