          <p>Following a week of aerial attacks, Israel and Iran have reportedly agreed to a ceasefire, according to President Trump. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before a complete end to the conflict. This development follows Iran's missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran. While a full battle damage assessment is pending, Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," marking a potential turning point in the escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump took a gamble by involving the US in the conflict between Israel and Iran, which may have resulted in a ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire that he said could lead to a lasting peace. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the development, White House officials are privately touting it as a diplomatic breakthrough. This development comes after Iran retaliated for Saturday's US strike, with missiles directed at a US base in Qatar being intercepted with no casualties or damage.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer stated that a commitment to international law is at the heart of Prime Minister Starmer's government and its approach to foreign policy. He defended Starmer's decision to seek a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù relationship with President Trump, arguing that this has enabled the UK to strike economic deals with the US, India, and the EU. Hermer emphasized that complying with international law is overwhelmingly in the national interests of the country. He also noted the importance of maintaining open communication and mutual respect in the UK's relationship with the US.</p>
