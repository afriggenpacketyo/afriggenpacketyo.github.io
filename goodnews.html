          <p>Former President Joe Biden has launched a fundraising initiative for his presidential library, which will be located in his home state of Delaware. A 13-person governance board, including former aides and political allies, has been established to oversee the project, which faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate. The library aims to feature an immersive museum detailing his presidency and serve as a center for civic engagement and leadership. The project's cost is anticipated to be substantial, following the trend of increasingly expensive presidential libraries.</p>

          <p>An environmental non-profit live-streamed a dive to the bottom of Lake Tahoe using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), offering thousands of viewers a rare look at one of the deepest lakes in the United States. The event aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem, its ancient geological history, and the environmental challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts on the stream discussed the lake's ecological importance and dispelled popular myths about mafia bodies, instead highlighting the need for conservation efforts. The dive was part of ongoing initiatives to clean up trash from the lakebed.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo and is urging a major strategic overhaul to boost the company's underperforming stock. In a detailed presentation, Elliott argues that PepsiCo's North American beverage business has suffered from strategic errors, such as retaining its bottling operations and failing to reinvest in core soda brands. The firm recommends refranchising the bottling network, divesting weaker brands like Quaker, and refocusing investment on high-growth areas to restore profitability and market value. Elliott believes these changes could unlock over 50% upside for shareholders by improving operational efficiency and long-term growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Coach Explains Her Preference for Renting Over Homeownership Despite Wealth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advocates for renting, challenging the conventional wisdom that homeownership is the primary path to wealth. After owning four properties, she and her husband sold them to return to renting, a move she claims accelerated their wealth accumulation by freeing up capital for investment and reducing the stress of property management. Joy argues that homeownership involves significant hidden costs, such as maintenance and renovations, and that being a landlord can be an emotional and logistical burden. She emphasizes that renting provides greater lifestyle flexibility and mobility, which has allowed her to focus on growing her income.</p>

          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur has elevated Vinai Venkatesham, the former CEO of rival club Arsenal, to its most senior executive position. Venkatesham is known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta at Arsenal and for his empathetic leadership during the pandemic. He is described as an understated, inclusive leader who believes in delegating football-related decisions to experts like the head coach and technical director.

          <p>A Massachusetts family is sharing their story after their son, Jonny, was diagnosed with malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and aggressive cancer, just after his first birthday. After a series of persistent infections, a large tumor was discovered on his liver, leading to a grim prognosis from doctors. However, an individualized and intensive treatment plan at Massachusetts General Hospital, involving complex chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, successfully sent the cancer into remission. Now over two years old, Jonny is undergoing careful surveillance, and his family is adjusting to their "new normal" after a traumatic year.</p>

          <p>A test flight in China has demonstrated the effectiveness of an AI-powered radar system that researchers claim cannot be jammed. According to a paper from the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, the AI-enhanced system maintained a target tracking continuity of over 99%, compared to 70-80% for conventional radar systems under jamming conditions. The successful test suggests a significant breakthrough in military radar technology. The project's lead scientist stated that this development could lead to a "paradigm shift" in radar design philosophy, enhancing detection capabilities in contested electronic warfare environments.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, one of NPR's "founding mothers" and a pioneering voice in radio, is retiring after more than 50 years with the network. In 1972, she became the first woman to anchor a national nightly news broadcast in the U.S. as a co-host of "All Things Considered." Her curious, insightful, and distinctive style helped define NPR's sound and personality, transforming it from a fledgling network into a major media institution. Colleagues and listeners remember her for breaking barriers for women in broadcasting and for her unique ability to ask simple yet profound questions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are optimistic about recent progress in the fight against dementia, citing new diagnostic tools and growing evidence for lifestyle-based prevention strategies. The recent FDA approval of a blood test offers a simpler method for early Alzheimer's diagnosis, while a major study called the U.S. POINTER Study showed cognitive improvement in at-risk individuals who adopted healthier habits. This regimen included physical activity, a healthy diet, brain exercises, and social engagement, reinforcing the idea that what is good for the body is also good for the brain. These developments offer hope for delaying or preventing cognitive decline before symptoms appear.</p>

          <p>China is designing a mission to test its ability to defend Earth from potential asteroid impacts, according to the chief designer of its lunar program, Wu Weiren. The planned "kinetic impact demonstration mission" will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away with an impactor spacecraft, aiming to alter its orbit slightly. An observer spacecraft will monitor the results, testing the feasibility of the deflection technique. If successful, China would join the United States as the only nations to have demonstrated this planetary defense capability, marking a significant step in its deep space exploration ambitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices surging to new records this year amid economic uncertainty, many investors are looking to add the precious metal to their portfolios. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), as the most liquid and cost-effective method. This approach is considered more efficient than purchasing physical gold bars or coins, which involve higher transaction and storage costs. While gold is seen as a safe-haven asset, advisors typically suggest limiting its allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is scheduled to be canonized as the Catholic Church's first Millennial saint. Known for his "normality" as a video-game-playing, website-building teen, Acutis has been embraced by the Church as a modern example of faith for young people. However, his life also contained deeply traditional and mystic elements, including a profound devotion to the Eucharist and a self-imposed limit of one hour of video games per week. His story represents a unique junction for the Church, blending contemporary, tech-fluent youth with ancient, supernatural beliefs.</p>

          <p>Following a report on the devastating impact of U.S. foreign aid cuts on HIV patients in Zambia, the Zambian government has stepped in to help. After initially denying the problem, officials verified the situation and partnered with a local pastor, Billiance Chondwe, to connect thousands of patients with government-run clinics to resume their life-saving medication. While access to drugs has improved, the disruption has created new hardships, as patients and laid-off clinic workers now struggle with food insecurity since U.S.-funded programs also provided nutritional support. The long-term sustainability of the new volunteer-led system remains a significant concern.</p>

          <p>The 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-Black unit known as the "Harlem Hellfighters," has been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor. The regiment was celebrated for its bravery and extended service on the front lines of World War I, fighting alongside the French army due to segregation in U.S. forces. Despite their battlefield renown, their contributions were largely ignored for decades. The honor comes amid a national debate over how American history is taught and remembered, with some historians noting the irony of celebrating the soldiers while the current administration reviews museum content to promote "American exceptionalism."</p>
