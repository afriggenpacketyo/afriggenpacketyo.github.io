          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is planning to incorporate artificial intelligence into its weather forecasting system to improve accuracy. The agency established a new team in April to combine AI predictions based on historical data with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system will use deep learning to analyze large datasets and generate forecasts for temperature, rainfall, and typhoon paths. While AI will enhance data functionality, human forecasters will still oversee the process and issue final reports. The agency also plans to use deep learning to process data from the Himawari-10 weather satellite starting in fiscal year 2029.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm moved through the Chicago area on Friday, causing significantly reduced visibility on several Interstate highways and at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued dust storm warnings as a wall of dust moved through the area at 50 mph. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to showers and storms coinciding with the dust storm. Wind gusts reached over 70 miles per hour during the storms. A few schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather events, and cooler, dry weather is expected over the weekend before a rainy pattern returns next week.</p>

          <p>Fujii Shuzo, a sake brewery in southwestern Japan with over 150 years of history, has begun offering a seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques, recently added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list. The five-day seminar, part of the Sake Sommelier Academy's course, aims to increase awareness and appreciation of sake outside Japan. The brewery hopes to expand exports to Europe, addressing concerns about the shrinking domestic sake market by promoting sake as a globally recognized beverage, similar to beer and wine. Japan's sake shipping volume has declined since 1973, but growing international popularity has recently boosted exports.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump faced setbacks in the courts and Congress on Friday, as his administration concluded a tour of the Middle East. The Supreme Court rejected the administration's request to remove a temporary block on deportations of Venezuelans. Right-wing lawmakers in the House of Representatives derailed Trump's signature legislation, preventing its passage through a key committee. The bill aimed to extend tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term. The president had been visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, but did not include a stop in Israel.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown in Sevnica, Slovenia, was stolen after being cut off at the feet. Police are investigating the theft, but residents suspect vandalism or melting down for cash, rather than political motives. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze, was never popular among locals. Sevnica has capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump with themed products, despite her infrequent visits since leaving in 1985. The statue had previously been set on fire in 2020, leading to the bronze replacement.</p>

This shift reflects a broader effort within the party to rebuild trust by confronting how the 2024 race was handled, particularly the efforts to downplay concerns about Mr. Biden‚Äôs age and health.

          <p>Youth mobility and fishing rights are key negotiating points ahead of a UK/EU summit aimed at resetting relations. The EU proposes a "youth mobility scheme" allowing citizens aged 18-30 to stay up to four years, but the UK is concerned about immigration impacts. Fishing rights are also contentious, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups want changes. A UK/EU youth mobility scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, and the UK could phase in the scheme if concerned about the impact. UK fishing groups want to stop EU vessels entering coastal waters and easier access to EU markets.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will significantly limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breaches of fiduciary duty. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares (worth over $30 billion) to initiate or maintain a derivative proceeding. This change leverages a Texas state law and poses a substantial barrier to lawsuits against Tesla insiders. The move follows Tesla's shift of incorporation to Texas after a Delaware court ruled against Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package.</p>
