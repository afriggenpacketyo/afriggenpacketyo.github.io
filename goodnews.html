          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant reshuffle of his top ministerial team, prompted by the resignation of his deputy prime minister. Key changes include moving Yvette Cooper from the Home Office to the Foreign Office and appointing a new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The shake-up is viewed as a strategic effort to regain political momentum and reset the government's approach on critical issues like illegal immigration and its relationship with the farming community.</p>
