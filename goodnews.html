          <p>The UK government is finalizing its spending review, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper being the last minister to agree on a funding deal with the Treasury. While police budgets are expected to increase, negotiations are ongoing about the wider Home Office budget. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the need for police to embrace change and contribute to reforming public services. The review is set against a backdrop of commitments to increase defense spending and invest in technology and infrastructure, however, the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that modest growth rates necessitate sharp trade-offs. Spending decisions are being made as the chancellor seeks to meet fiscal rules and reduce debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Red Sox rookie Hunter Dobbins is set to pitch against the New York Yankees, expressing his lifelong disdain for the rival team, even stating he would retire before signing with them. Dobbins's loyalty stems from his father's fervent Red Sox fandom, influencing his own preferences. While acknowledging the potential for players to switch allegiances in professional sports, Dobbins hopes to remain with the Red Sox throughout his career. He did, however, make an exception for Andy Pettitte, a former Yankees player who was a friend of his father. He looks to help his team win the series.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stumbled while boarding Air Force One, drawing mockery on social media, especially after he questioned if he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles. This incident comes after Trump frequently criticized former President Joe Biden for similar stumbles during his time in office. Social media users were quick to point out the irony, with some suggesting Trump might need a wheelchair. Trump had previously mocked Biden for falling at the Air Force graduation ceremony in 2023. The incident has sparked debate about Trump's physical fitness and its implications for his leadership.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance, earning his first win of the season as the Dodgers defeated the Cardinals 7-3, ending a two-game losing streak. Kershaw allowed just one run on six hits in five innings, striking out seven, and did not issue a walk. The Dodgers' offense supported Kershaw with seven runs, their highest in a game this month. Manager Dave Roberts praised Kershaw's ability to be a stopper for the team, and the win comes at a crucial time ahead of a series against the Padres.

Other frequent sources of conflict include family relations, household chores, and communication styles.

Strategies for resolving these conflicts include naming the effect, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated time-out signal.
