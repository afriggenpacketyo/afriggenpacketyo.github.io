        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a revised 0.1% contraction in the previous month. This marginal expansion occurs as the government faces mounting pressure to boost the economy ahead of the upcoming Budget. Over the three months leading to August, the economy expanded by 0.3%, primarily driven by the services sector, though some consumer-facing areas showed weakness. Economists suggest that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary for the chancellor to meet self-imposed borrowing regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, surging 39.1% year-over-year and significantly exceeding market expectations. This substantial growth is attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's revenue also rose by 30.3%, with its high-performance computing division constituting 57% of total sales. In light of these strong results, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling confidence in the continued AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former England and Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has stated that his move to play for Arabian Falcons in the UAE's third-tier league was not financially motivated. The 33-year-old explained that after an unsuccessful trial at Hull City and a subsequent injury, he sought a "fresh start" for his family, citing concerns about safety and the social climate in the UK. Shelvey emphasized his desire to enjoy football again and is now combining playing with coaching as he works towards his UEFA A Licence. He also reflected fondly on his seven-year tenure at Newcastle, describing it as a special time in his career.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance, scoring 22 points, including six three-pointers, in a 121-94 preseason loss to the Dallas Mavericks. Vincent started the game on a hot streak, hitting his first five three-point attempts and scoring 18 points in the first quarter alone. The game saw a different starting lineup for the Lakers, who were without key players like Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves. Despite Vincent's strong showing, the team was outscored 37-8 in the final quarter, highlighting areas for improvement as they approach the regular season.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old hillwalker, Ian Currie, has been rescued after being lost for eight days in the remote and treacherous terrain of the Scottish Highlands. Currie became disoriented during a planned 30-mile trek from Glenfinnan to Knoydart due to severe weather, which left him with a soaked tent, sleeping bag, and a non-functional phone. Exhausted and suffering from exposure, he was eventually found by a local estate owner and deer stalkers after a search was initiated by mountain rescue teams. Currie described the ordeal as a "long black nightmare" and expressed immense gratitude for his survival and rescue.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate against the U.S. dollar to its strongest level in a year. This move comes as market expectations grow for further interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which would weaken the dollar. A Fed governor recently highlighted that uncertainties from U.S.-China trade tensions have increased risks to the U.S. economy, strengthening the case for rate cuts. The stronger fixing reflects Beijing's efforts to manage its currency's value amidst a complex global economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, surged to a record high on Thursday, driven by positive economic news.

Major technology and automotive companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor led the gains. The strong performance of the South Korean market comes as a bright spot amid broader global economic uncertainty and persistent trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice as he works to break out of a significant postseason slump. Since the start of the playoffs, the two-way phenom is just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts, a performance manager Dave Roberts said is not conducive to winning a World Series. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting, stating he does not feel a direct physical connection between the two roles. His visible effort to recalibrate his swing signals an urgent desire to return to form for the remainder of the NLCS.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the current government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent termination notices to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director indicating that more than 10,000 jobs could be cut. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's social media posts suggesting the cuts were intended to target programs favored by Democrats. The order, which applies to employees represented by two major unions, halts the terminations pending a further hearing.</p>

          <p>A long-forgotten diary discovered in a Hong Kong apartment has revealed the firsthand account of Lam Ping-yu, a Chinese naval officer who participated in the D-Day landings. Lam was one of over 20 Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe during World War II. His detailed diary provides a unique perspective on the Normandy invasion from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies, including a narrow escape from torpedoes. This historical finding sheds new light on the multinational cooperation that was crucial to the Allied victory and highlights a little-known aspect of China's involvement in the European theater.</p>

          <p>British band The Last Dinner Party, winners of the BBC's Sound of 2024, are releasing their second album, "From The Pyre," which they describe as darker and more grandiose than their debut. The group explains that their rapid success gave them the confidence to be more ambitious and experimental, exploring themes of love, death, and grief with intricate musical arrangements. Despite a whirlwind year of touring, the album was largely written over a four-month period at the start of the year. The record reflects their growth as musicians and their desire to challenge themselves creatively while building on their theatrical and personal songwriting style.</p>
