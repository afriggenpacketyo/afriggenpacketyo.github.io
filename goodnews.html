          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order on Monday to lower some U.S. drug prices by aligning them with the lowest prices paid by other economically advanced countries, reviving a policy from his first term. This "most favored nation" pricing model aims to lower costs for medications administered in doctor's offices and covered by Medicare, but it will likely face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The industry argues that such measures would stifle innovation and reduce investment in research and development, while Trump asserts that the U.S. is being exploited by higher drug prices compared to other nations. A similar order signed during his first term was blocked by the courts.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially to be transferred to his presidential library after his term. This has ignited ethical debates and scrutiny over possible violations of the Emoluments Clause, with concerns raised about foreign influence and transparency. While Qatari officials have confirmed discussions about the potential transfer, they deny that a final decision has been made or that the plane will be gifted during Trump's upcoming visit. The plan has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs, who question the legality and appropriateness of accepting such a substantial gift from a foreign government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports of entry due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexico. The USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the measure to prevent the devastating pest from entering the United States, where it could harm livestock. The suspension will continue on a month-to-month basis until containment is achieved, with the U.S. and Mexico collaborating on eradication efforts through surveillance, treatment, and sterile insect dispersal. This decision prioritizes animal and food safety, despite potential economic impacts on livestock trade.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese authorities have removed the "Han Chinese" category from the official information page of the Executive Yuan, classifying them as "other population," a move criticized by the KMT as a "denial of history." This change, made on March 24, categorizes the majority Han Chinese population as "other population," while emphasizing the island's indigenous identity. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan‚Äôs ruling party, is intensifying efforts to distance the island from mainland China and promote its distinct identity. The Executive Yuan did not publicly announce the change, which was spotted by Taiwanese media outlets.</p>

He notes the growing recognition in the U.S. that extreme tariffs are essentially a form of embargo, leading to economic instability. Yao believes that a rollback to a more manageable tariff level is possible, along with potential demands for China to purchase more American goods. He emphasizes that the goal of confrontation is to eventually return to the negotiating table and find a mutually beneficial resolution.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, lauded for affordability and supporting a long-lived population, is facing increasing strain due to a shrinking workforce and an aging population, leading to its entanglement in political maneuvering. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly through medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased costs for high medical cost patients. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and public trust, necessitating a measured debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures. The government has since frozen all envisioned hikes following talks with patient advocates.</p>

The Israeli prime minister's office confirmed being informed by the U.S. of Hamas's intention, with Israel stating that negotiations will continue amid ongoing military operations.

          <p>A direct comparison of the weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese participants and showed that those on Mounjaro also experienced greater waistline reduction and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. While both drugs had similar side effects, researchers suggest that Mounjaro may be more beneficial for individuals with significant weight to lose. Both drugs work by mimicking hormones that induce feelings of fullness, but Mounjaro targets two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy targets only one.</p>

Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>

The statue will be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.

          <p>As President Trump prepares to visit Gulf states, a key focus will be securing new investments for the US economy, particularly from sovereign wealth funds. The visit, which includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, aims to signal the success of Trump's "America First" agenda. While Gulf states have already committed significant investments, Trump seeks to increase these further, particularly in sectors like AI and manufacturing. Discussions will also center on arms sales and easing procurement processes for Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that "substantial progress" was made in trade talks between U.S. and Chinese delegations in Switzerland, though details remain scarce. The meetings, aimed at defusing tariff tensions, mark the first face-to-face contact between senior officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods. President Trump claimed that Chinese officials are eager to make a deal and suggested lowering tariffs, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. The talks are seen as crucial for stabilizing world markets and easing disruptions to trade between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that it reached a trade deal with China as the two countries negotiated for a second day in Switzerland.

          <p>The United States will suspend imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border with Mexico for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Sunday.

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu√© said on social media that he had spoken with Rollins, who had informed of the decision.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has found documentation associated with the Nazi regime among its archives including propaganda material that was used to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in the South American nation, a judicial authority from the Court told the Associated Press on Sunday. The court came across the material when preparing for the creation of a museum with its historical documents, the source said. The official requested anonymity due to internal policies.
