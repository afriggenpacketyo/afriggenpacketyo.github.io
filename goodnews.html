Emery expressed confidence that Watkins' hard work will eventually lead to goals, emphasizing his contributions to the team's tasks and overall play. The manager's support aims to boost the 29-year-old's morale during a challenging period for the club's key forward.</p>

Officials confirmed there was no indication of a malicious cyberattack, attributing the issue to an "accidental fiber cut."

          <p>Costco has surpassed Wall Street's quarterly earnings and revenue expectations, reporting double-digit gains in both membership income and its e-commerce division. CFO Gary Millerchip noted the company's efforts to offset higher tariff costs by introducing Kirkland Signature alternatives and diversifying merchandise. While overall inflation remains low, non-food merchandise saw a return of inflation due to imported items. The warehouse club continues to attract new, younger members, contributing to its full-year revenue growth and a recent increase in membership fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched their 12th National League West title in 13 years with a decisive 8-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite a regular season that fell short of preseason "juggernaut" predictions, manager Dave Roberts believes the team is now playing its best baseball. The win ensures a home start for the playoffs, beginning with a wild-card round. The Dodgers' blueprint for postseason success—superb starting pitching, creative bullpen management, and explosive offense—was evident in their recent performance, giving them momentum for their quest for a second consecutive World Series title.</p>

The sheriff expressed commitment to learning from mistakes and ensuring justice for the victim's family, while confirming an internal review is underway.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal for US investors to acquire TikTok's US operations, valued at $14 billion, to avoid a ban. This agreement, reportedly blessed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, mandates that US investors will control the app's algorithm, with Americans holding six of seven board seats, and ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. Oracle and Rupert Murdoch are named among the "patriotic" investors. The deal aims to address national security concerns by retraining the algorithm on US user data and monitoring software updates, ensuring the app's continued operation for 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Late billionaire Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime partner, believed that owning "really fancy houses" often diminishes, rather than enhances, personal happiness. Munger, who lived in a modest home for decades, observed that such lavish estates typically serve for large-scale entertaining but offer little personal benefit and can negatively influence children's upbringing. He intentionally avoided a grand lifestyle, suggesting that while a comfortable home is helpful, chasing excessive luxury for appearances or perceived happiness often backfires. His perspective challenges the common belief that more square footage equates to greater satisfaction.</p>
