          <p>A musical advertisement from cryptocurrency firm Coinbase, titled "Everything is Fine," has generated significant online discussion by satirizing the UK's economic challenges. The ad portrays a country beset by strikes, high prices, and crumbling infrastructure, leading to praise from some in the tech and venture capital sectors but criticism from others who found it misleading and self-promotional. While Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claimed the ad was not a political statement against a specific party, it has been interpreted as a critique of the current government and a call to update the financial system with crypto.

          <p>Millions of UK drivers who purchased a vehicle using car finance within the last 18 years may be entitled to compensation due to a recent Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions. The ruling established that some dealers charged excessive or poorly explained fees, treating customers unfairly. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation scheme, with payments expected in 2026. For now, consumers are advised to wait for the official scheme or write to their lender to gather facts, rather than using claims companies that charge a fee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has granted CEO Elon Musk a new share award valued at approximately $29 billion, a move the company says is intended to incentivize him to remain with the firm amid a growing "war for AI talent." This decision comes after a Delaware court invalidated his previous $50 billion pay package from 2018, ruling it was unfair to shareholders. The board stated it is imperative to retain Musk's leadership as Tesla pivots towards becoming an AI and robotics company. Musk's other executive roles include positions at xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace has officially launched her campaign to become the next governor of South Carolina. Announcing her bid at The Citadel, where she was the first female graduate of the Corps of Cadets, Mace enters what is expected to be a crowded GOP primary. Known as a firebrand, Mace has shifted from more moderate stances to championing conservative causes and has overcome a primary challenge despite prior criticism of Donald Trump. She cited issues like the economy, crime, and "gender-bending ideology" as key motivations for her run for statewide office.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Baidu is set to expand its autonomous vehicle operations into Europe through a new partnership with U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft. The plan is to deploy Baidu's driverless robotaxis in the U.K. and Germany starting in 2026, with the goal of having thousands of vehicles across the continent in subsequent years, pending regulatory approval. This move follows Lyft's recent acquisition of the European ride-hailing firm FreeNow. The partnership marks a significant international push for Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi service and a potential competitive advantage for Lyft in the European market.</p>

          <p>An article profiles the LARP Adventure Program (LAP), an after-school and summer camp in Massachusetts that uses live-action role-playing to teach creative problem-solving and build community. Founder Eric Love and marketing coordinator Elle Dunne describe how the program provides a safe, empowering space for youth, particularly those who are neurodivergent or part of the LGBT community. Despite its success in fostering personal growth and empathy, the small business faces significant financial challenges, including affordability for families and the high cost of operations, highlighting the struggle between maintaining a high-quality, mission-driven service and ensuring its own survival.</p>

          <h2>A Writer Reflects on Finding Solace with the Muppets While Grieving Her Father</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay for The Atlantic, a writer recounts how watching "The Muppet Show" became a crucial coping mechanism while caring for and grieving her dying father, Marshall Brickman. Her father, a co-writer of "Annie Hall," had briefly worked with Jim Henson and was credited with creating the Swedish Chef's nonsensical accent. Rediscovering the show's blend of silliness and sophistication provided an escape from daily dread and a way to connect with her own children. The essay explores how the Muppets' porous boundary between reality and simulation mirrored her own disorienting experience of grief, offering unexpected moments of connection to her past.</p>

          <p>In a Test match for the ages, India defeated England by a mere six runs to draw the series 2-2 at The Oval. The final day was filled with unbelievable drama, culminating in England's injured Chris Woakes coming out to bat with his arm in a sling in a courageous but ultimately futile effort. England, chasing a target of 374, fell just short when Gus Atkinson was bowled by Mohammed Siraj, who delivered a heroic performance for India. The conclusion was a fittingly epic end to a grueling and fractious five-match series.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is running again as an independent for a U.S. Senate seat in the Republican-dominated state of Nebraska. After a surprisingly strong showing against Senator Deb Fischer last year, Osborn is now challenging Senator Pete Ricketts, framing the race as a contest between the working class and the wealthy elite. Osborn believes voters are seeking a candidate outside the two-party system who can break the political logjam. While he faces a tough challenge against the popular and well-funded incumbent, his campaign has prompted political forecasters to watch the race more closely.</p>

The Police Records Access Project, a collaboration between UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and several news outlets, provides unprecedented access to internal affairs files. The project is the result of years of work collecting and organizing records released under state law. It aims to vastly expand public transparency and show how agencies across the state handle allegations of officer misconduct and incidents resulting in serious injury or death.</p>

          <p>A new survey of American children aged 8 to 12 indicates that while they spend significant time online, their preferred way to socialize is through unstructured, in-person play with friends. The research suggests that the "phone-based childhood" is often a substitute for the real-world freedom that children crave but are denied by parents concerned about safety. The authors argue that to reduce screen time, parents and communities must restore opportunities for independence and unsupervised play. They highlight growing movements and programs aimed at fostering these experiences, which are crucial for developing competence, confidence, and positive mental health.</p>
