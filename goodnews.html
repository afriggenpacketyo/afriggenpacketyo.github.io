          <p>The online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, resulting in a company valuation of $8.6 billion. This pricing falls in the middle of its expected range and successfully raised $800 million for the company. The IPO marks a significant moment for StubHub, which has faced previous delays in its attempts to go public due to market volatility. The company's shares are scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB."</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues for the accelerated production of the B-21 Raider, America's new sixth-generation stealth bomber, to effectively counter strategic threats from nations like China. The piece highlights the successful flight tests of the second B-21, nicknamed "Spartan," as evidence of the program's remarkable progress and efficiency, noting it is running significantly under budget. The author suggests that the current fleet of B-2 stealth bombers is insufficient for modern deterrence needs. President Trump is urged to authorize a second production line to expand the fleet more rapidly.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Mummification in Southern China Predates Egyptian Practices by Millennia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 05:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new archaeological study indicates that inhabitants of ancient southern China and Southeast Asia were practicing mummification as early as 12,000 years ago. This discovery suggests the practice is far older than previously thought, predating the well-known Chinchorro mummies of Chile by 5,000 years and the earliest Egyptian examples by over 7,000 years. Researchers from several international institutions analyzed 54 pre-Neolithic burials, finding evidence that bodies were smoke-dried over long periods. This reveals complex mortuary practices among the region's ancient hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic era.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The zarf, a Turkish word for "envelope," refers to the decorative, often jeweled holders used for handleless coffee cups, particularly during the Ottoman Empire. These items were not only functional for holding hot beverages but also served as symbols of luxury, elegance, and social rank. While the term has been anachronistically applied to modern cardboard coffee sleeves, purists argue the comparison is unfitting. The original zarfs were part of a rich cultural ritual surrounding the preparation and serving of Turkish coffee, a tradition recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance.</p>

          <p>An Albuquerque teacher, Juli Cobb, found herself in a vulnerable situation when her car ran out of gas near a large homeless encampment. As she sat anxiously in her stalled vehicle, three men from the encampment came to her aid without hesitation. They first worked together to push her car safely out of the road, directing traffic around her. One of the men, Dominic, stayed with her to ensure her safety while another biked to get gas, leaving a lasting impression of kindness and generosity on Cobb.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has granted a last-minute injunction to prevent the removal of a 25-year-old Eritrean man from the UK to France. The man, who arrived by small boat, was set to be the first person returned under a new pilot scheme between the two countries. His lawyers successfully argued that he needed more time to present evidence that he may be a victim of modern slavery, a claim which they argued was being rushed. The ruling represents the first legal challenge to the new "one in, one out" returns agreement.</p>

          <p>Germany's national basketball program is currently experiencing a golden era, highlighted by recent World and European championship titles. However, the domestic league, the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL), is facing a new challenge from the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) system in U.S. college sports. This policy allows student-athletes to earn significant income, making U.S. colleges a more attractive destination for top young German talent. This trend poses a threat to the BBL's ability to retain its most promising players, prompting calls for a compensation system for the German clubs that develop them.</p>

          <p>Three companies that conducted forward stock splits in 2025—O'Reilly Automotive, Fastenal, and Interactive Brokers Group—have seen their stock values rise dramatically, far outpacing the benchmark S&P 500's year-to-date gains. Forward stock splits, which lower a company's share price to make it more accessible, are often undertaken by businesses that are outperforming their competitors. O'Reilly has benefited from an aging vehicle fleet, Fastenal from its strong B2B integration, and Interactive Brokers from increased trading activity, with all three seeing year-to-date gains of over 30%.

The plan, released by the Ministry of Commerce and other departments, focuses on relaxing market access and increasing supply in areas like culture, sports, and healthcare. Key measures include attracting more foreign investment into high-end medical care, hosting more international sporting events, and extending the operating hours of museums. The government also plans to expand visa-free travel to attract more tourists and encourage financial institutions to increase lending.</p>

          <p>Renowned football manager José Mourinho is reportedly close to making a return to Portuguese club Benfica, following the sacking of their previous manager, Bruno Lage. Lage was dismissed after a disappointing Champions League loss, and the club's president has indicated a new manager will be appointed quickly. Mourinho, who began his managerial career at Benfica in 2000 for a brief stint, was recently let go by Turkish club Fenerbahce. If appointed, he would return to manage in his home country for the first time since leaving Porto for Chelsea in 2004.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech company Baidu surged nearly 16% in Hong Kong, reaching a two-year high, following a positive assessment of its artificial intelligence ventures. The stock rally was spurred by a ratings upgrade from an equity research firm, which cited a promising outlook for Baidu's AI chip and cloud-computing revenues. The company has been investing heavily in its AI capabilities, including its popular Ernie Bot, and has reportedly begun using its own internally designed chips to train its models. This strategic pivot towards AI is seen as a way to offset slowing growth.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom is being leveraged to secure significant trade and investment deals, particularly in the technology sector. The visit has already seen major announcements, including multi-billion-pound AI and data center investments from companies like Nvidia, Google, and Blackstone. This "tiara diplomacy" is seen as crucial for the stagnating UK economy, taking advantage of Trump's affinity for the country to strengthen the "special relationship." The focus is on establishing a form of "AI sovereignty" for the UK with American support, countering similar infrastructure offers from China.</p>
