          <p>DoorDash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, aiming to enhance its local commerce capabilities and support financial goals. However, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, reporting $3.03 billion against an expected $3.09 billion, although this still represents a 21% increase from the previous year. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash's total orders increased by 18% to 732 million, slightly below analyst predictions. The company anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the second quarter to range from $600 million to $650 million.</p>
