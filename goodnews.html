          <p>An ICE official reported that the U.S. has secured assurances from Venezuela's Maduro regime to allow the return of former CECOT prison detainees if required by a U.S. court. This follows an exchange where over 250 Venezuelan migrants were released from the El Salvadoran prison. Separately, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the renovation of the Fed's headquarters against administration criticism, asserting responsible stewardship of public funds and denying claims of "VIP dining rooms." The article also notes President Trump's continued public criticism of Powell over interest rates.</p>

          <h2>CBS News Poll Finds Majority of Americans Support a Return to the Moon and a Mission to Mars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that about two-thirds of Americans favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also indicates that a large majority of the public still views the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement. These positive sentiments about space exploration cut across political and ideological lines, with many believing the space program contributes to national pride and technological advancement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology companies are increasingly challenging the dominance of U.S. firms like OpenAI and Google by releasing powerful open-source artificial intelligence models. Companies such as DeepSeek have launched advanced large language models (LLMs) that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, fostering a collaborative global development environment. This open-source strategy provides a significant alternative to the closed, proprietary systems of Silicon Valley. Analysts suggest that this approach could redefine the global AI landscape and pose a serious competitive threat to American tech giants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed deal involves the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as the director of Mossad reportedly visited Washington to discuss potential plans for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. Trump has been actively promoting the ceasefire negotiations, which are being mediated by Qatari officials.</p>

          <p>The Australian government announced it has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a $160 million military aid package. This contribution is intended to help Ukraine defend itself against the ongoing Russian invasion. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over $980 million in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment, since the conflict began in 2022. The delivery of the tanks is seen as a significant boost to Ukraine's ground forces, with the remainder of the promised 49 tanks scheduled to arrive in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a retired U.S. Marine, found solace from the horrors of the Vietnam War by envisioning a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending the next 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. In 2010, the "Carousel of Happiness" opened in Nederland, Colorado, becoming a nonprofit dedicated to spreading joy. The project has not only delighted over a million visitors but has also served as powerful medicine for Harrison, helping him heal by creating something beautiful for others.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first significant U.S. regulatory framework for digital currencies, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bipartisan bill establishes consumer protections and clear rules for stablecoins, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, and allows banks and credit unions to issue their own. Hailed by the administration as a "revolution in financial technology," the act is seen as a major step toward integrating cryptocurrency into the mainstream financial system.

          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild leg swelling, medical experts have explained the common condition. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling, aching, or heaviness. The condition affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often managed with lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise. The White House physician described the president's case as "benign and common" and stated he remains in "excellent health" with no signs of more serious cardiovascular issues.</p>

The proposed hub would focus on attracting companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other frontier technologies, with the goal of "bringing R&D and manufacturing back together."

          <p>Following a warm and dry spring, the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer, according to pest control experts and entomologists. While scientific data is still pending, anecdotal evidence points to a "good year for wasps," which thrive in such weather patterns. Experts note that while social wasps can be a nuisance, they are also vital apex predators that provide natural pest control. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them from picnics by leaving a small amount of a sugary substance nearby.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical comedy, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has opened in Liverpool, reimagining the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a "Lord of the Rings"-style fantasy epic. Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the show is a tongue-in-cheek homage that avoids targeting the couple, instead celebrating them as local heroes. The plot is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring, merging the urban legend with a classic fantasy quest. The play is characteristic of the Royal Court theatre's focus on homegrown comedies relevant to its Liverpool audience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research found that in individuals with a faulty version of a gene called OTUD3, a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria can over-activate an immune protein named STING, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments work inconsistently. The discovery opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that could target this specific pathway rather than broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>
