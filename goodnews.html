Badenoch argues that both leaders support scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which she claims would force taxpayers to fund unlimited child support. She asserts that Britain cannot afford their economic approaches and that the Conservative party is the only one seriously examining the welfare state. Her comments follow Labour's indication of considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap and Reform UK's pledge to remove it if they win power.</p>
