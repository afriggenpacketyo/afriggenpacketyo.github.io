          <h2>UK Government to Offer Substantial Discounts to Encourage Electric Vehicle Adoption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:11:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. government is introducing a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750 to incentivize the purchase of new electric cars. The discounts will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million, three-year plan to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban. While the move is welcomed by some automakers, critics argue the country lacks sufficient public charging infrastructure, with only 82,000 points currently available. The policy aims to make zero-emission vehicles more affordable for families, but faces opposition who claim the country is not ready for the shift.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:00:53 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion article posits that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must power the massive energy needs of data centers with its abundant natural gas reserves. The author argues that relying on renewable energy sources is not currently scalable or reliable enough to meet the surging demand, risking the loss of AI innovation to other countries. The piece advocates for a pragmatic energy policy that co-locates natural gas power generation with data centers, independent of the main grid, to ensure affordability and prevent strain on consumer electricity supplies. This strategy is presented as essential for America's economic growth and national security.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:44:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will mandate that sex education classes include lessons on recognizing misogyny, understanding consent, and identifying the harms of AI-generated 'deepfakes'. The updated curriculum aims to help pupils identify positive male role models and resist harmful online influences, without imposing strict age limits on specific topics as previously proposed. Primary schools will cover respectful relationships and online risks, while secondary students will learn about sexual ethics and power dynamics. The move, welcomed by suicide prevention campaigners, is part of a broader effort to address the behavior and attitudes of boys and young men.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The Department of Homeland Security had planned to terminate their Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to work legally and shields them from removal. The ruling came after immigrant advocacy group CASA filed a lawsuit challenging the decision, arguing it is not safe for these individuals, many of whom assisted the U.S. during the war, to return to Afghanistan. The one-week stay provides a brief reprieve while the court considers the case, highlighting the precarious situation of Afghans who fled the Taliban.</p>

          <h2>Norway's EV Success Attributed to Consistent Pro-Adoption Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:03:37 EDT</div>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in electric vehicle adoption, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025, a dramatic increase from less than 1% in 2010. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong, consistent policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. This approach, combined with heavy investment in public charging infrastructure, has made EVs a common sight, improving air quality and reducing noise in cities like Oslo. The absence of a domestic automaker lobby is also considered a key factor in the rapid and successful transition.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm, Sweden, is being redeveloped into what is billed as the world's largest wooden city, in a $1.25 billion project named Sickla. The development will utilize cross-laminated timber to construct thousands of new homes, offices, and schools, aiming to showcase a more sustainable model for urban construction. Building with mass timber can reduce a project's global warming potential by over 80% compared to concrete. The project leverages Sweden's deep cultural and economic connection to its forests, with architects designing multi-use buildings that are both environmentally friendly and aesthetically pleasing, potentially commanding higher rental incomes.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a significant development after U.S. export controls effectively halted their distribution in April. The company stated that the U.S. government has provided assurances that the necessary sales licenses will be granted. This reversal follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership. The decision is seen as a major win for Nvidia, allowing it to reinforce its market position in China and potentially providing a new growth catalyst for the company in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced the company will spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build enormous AI data centers in the United States to power its ambitions in 'superintelligence'. The first multi-gigawatt facility, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of these data center clusters could cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan. This massive investment underscores Meta's commitment to leading the AI race, though it also raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption required for such large-scale AI infrastructure.</p>

Raleigh, who led the major leagues with 38 home runs at the All-Star break, is the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to win the competition. He advanced from the first round on a narrow tiebreaker before winning his semifinal match. One of the night's highlights was a 513-foot drive by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest of the event. Raleigh becomes the second Mariners player to claim the Derby title, following Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds produced by a plant, suggesting a previously unknown ecosystem of communication may exist. Researchers at Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic 'screams' associated with distress, such as dehydration. These sounds, which are outside the range of human hearing, could be perceived by many insects and some mammals. The discovery opens up a vast, unexplored field of study into how animals and potentially other plants use these acoustic signals to make decisions about their environment.</p>

          <p>A multinational crew of four private astronauts has departed the International Space Station (ISS) to begin their 22-hour journey back to Earth. The mission, organized by Axiom Space, was led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and included crewmates from India, Poland, and Hungary. During their 18-day stay, the astronauts conducted dozens of microgravity experiments. This flight, Axiom's fourth, represents a growing commercialization of low-Earth orbit, providing opportunities for countries and private entities to participate in space research. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule is expected to splash down off the coast of California.</p>
