          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has indicated that Shohei Ohtani is likely to return to pitching after the All-Star break. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023, with plans for him to participate in a simulated game. The Dodgers had initially considered an earlier return to the mound for Ohtani, but they ultimately decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehabilitation. Ohtani recently incorporated all his pitches, including a slider, into his practice sessions.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend after being closed due to the Palisades Fire, which isolated Malibu. While some locals express concerns about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful for a robust summer season after enduring significant losses due to the fire and road closure. The fire killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres, leaving visible scars along PCH, including twisted metal and charred trees. Despite the progress in debris removal, some residents worry about the long-term impact on the community.</p>

          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has issued an apology for inaccurately portraying Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The false information appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, which incorrectly labeled the condition as "inherited" when it is caused by mercury poisoning through seafood consumption. The company has since removed the video and stated that it has corrected the inaccurate phrasing, following criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury in wastewater from a chemical plant, affecting thousands around Minamata Bay.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways has become the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership, marking the beginning of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the move as a "watershed moment" aimed at improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure. Rail unions have welcomed the takeover, citing the failures of privatization, while the government anticipates saving up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators. The nationalization is intended to end three decades of fragmentation in the UK's rail services.</p>
