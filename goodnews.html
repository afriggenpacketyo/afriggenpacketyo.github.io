          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St. James's Park in central London. Jennings, who has previously sculpted King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed his desire to capture the late monarch's "grandeur and dignity" and reflect her global admiration. The final design for the statue and the broader memorial, which will include a new bridge and gardens, is set to be revealed in 2026. The project, with a budget between £23m and £46m, will require approval from the Royal Family as Jennings begins a period of consultation to determine the final form.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of substantial investment from American tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is positioning the United Kingdom as a potential AI superpower. During President Trump's state visit, Microsoft announced a £22 billion investment, while Google committed £5 billion to a new data center and its London-based AI firm, DeepMind. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has been particularly enthusiastic, declaring the UK's potential in the field. While some critics, like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, worry about the UK becoming overly dependent on Silicon Valley, the influx of capital is seen as a major boost to the nation's economy and its scientific research hubs.</p>

          <p>Academy Award-winning actor Cillian Murphy is promoting his new film "Steve" while also reflecting on his iconic role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders." Murphy emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for six seasons, calling the experience of growing with the character a defining privilege of his career. He confirmed that a "Peaky Blinders" film is forthcoming from Netflix, written by series creator Steven Knight, but stated that the plot remains a closely guarded secret. The actor noted the show's unexpected global success was a form of "magic" rooted in excellent writing and perfect timing.</p>

The "We Are America" marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, were greeted by supporters and members of Congress upon their arrival. Their mission was to build a unified movement to hold leaders accountable for what they see as threats to democracy. Along their journey through multiple states, they were housed and supported by local communities, demonstrating a widespread belief in their cause. Upon arrival, they presented a children's version of the U.S. Constitution to lawmakers.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a comprehensive package of climate bills designed to balance clean energy goals with economic stability. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, which is expected to generate billions to lower utility bills and fund public transit. However, in a controversial compromise, one bill will permit up to 2,000 new oil wells annually in Kern County through 2036, a move criticized by some environmental groups. The package also gives the governor power to suspend summer-blend gasoline standards to prevent price spikes, reflecting a pragmatic approach to transition the state's economy while addressing affordability and energy supply concerns.</p>

          <p>The Canadian women's rugby team delivered a historic upset, defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand Black Ferns in the World Cup semi-final. The victory ended New Zealand's remarkable 11-year, 4,063-day undefeated streak in the tournament. Canada dominated the match from the start, scoring three tries in the first 25 minutes to build a commanding lead that they defended skillfully in the second half. The achievement is particularly notable as the Canadian team had to crowdfund over half a million dollars just to participate in the tournament, making their journey to the final a true "fairytale" story of determination and tactical brilliance.</p>

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for military intervention to tackle illegal migration, a proposal UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected. Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders and that the military's primary focus must remain on national defense. The statement came as nearly 1,000 migrants crossed the Channel, and the UK government continued its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France, underscoring the political sensitivity of the issue.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, criticizing the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" due to its excessive length and florid detail. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday stated that the filing violated federal rules requiring allegations to be "simple, concise and direct." The judge found the first 79 pages to be unnecessarily long for a two-count complaint. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended, shorter version of the lawsuit, with a new limit of 40 pages, as they vow to continue holding the media accountable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, but a final agreement has not yet been reached. Following a phone call, Trump expressed optimism, stating a deal is "well on its way," while a White House official confirmed progress but noted more work is needed. The negotiations aim to resolve U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, which faces a federal law requiring it to divest or be banned. Trump, who has repeatedly extended the divestment deadline, has been eager to keep the popular social media platform available to American users.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new community policing initiative that would require every police force in England and Wales to open counters in public venues like supermarkets, libraries, and shopping centers. The policy, announced at the party's annual conference, aims to make it easier for the public to report crimes and to increase police visibility, which they argue has declined under previous governments. To fund the plan, the party suggests scrapping the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) roles, a move they estimate would free up over £100 million. The proposal seeks to address public concerns about police accessibility and restore confidence in local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA superstar Kevin Durant has finally regained access to his bitcoin holdings after being locked out of his account on the cryptocurrency exchange for several years. The issue gained public attention after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference.

The high-profile case has amplified broader customer complaints about Coinbase's support services, prompting Armstrong to state that the company is now putting a major focus on improving its customer support experience for all users.</p>
