          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, set to be operational by the mid-2030s, aiming to accommodate the expected surge in air travel demand in Asia. The new terminal will almost double the airport's existing size, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers annually, up from the current 90 million. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized that this expansion will enhance connectivity, linking the nation to 200 cities, compared to the current 170. The aviation ecosystem contributes 5% to Singapore's GDP, driving industries such as tourism, aerospace, and logistics, making this expansion a critical investment in the country's future.</p>

          <p>A manuscript long considered an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, acquired by Harvard Law School for just $27.50 in 1946, is now believed to be a genuine version dating back to 1300. Two medieval history professors, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, authenticated the document, identifying it as one of only seven originals from that period still in existence. The discovery was made after the professors analyzed digitised images of the manuscript, noting its handwriting, dimensions, and textual consistency with other known originals. The document is considered one of the world's most valuable documents and a cornerstone of freedoms.</p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal suggests that China possesses the financial strength to establish a market stabilisation fund, citing the nation's robust economy and substantial foreign exchange reserves. This proposal aims to stabilise the capital market, safeguard the interests of small and medium-sized investors, and mitigate systemic financial risks amidst global economic instability. The article highlights that China's enhanced regulatory capabilities would ensure the effective operation of such a fund.
