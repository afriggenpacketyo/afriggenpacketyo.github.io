          <p>China's latest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, recently sailed through the Taiwan Strait en route to the South China Sea for routine exercises, according to the Chinese navy. This transit is part of the carrier's construction process and is not aimed at any specific target, the navy stated. China claims the Taiwan Strait as its territory, a claim rejected by Taiwan's government. The Fujian, more advanced than China's other carriers, is undergoing sea trials before formally entering service, marking a steady expansion of China's naval power in the Pacific region. The routine transit showcases China's increasing maritime capabilities. Optimism score is 75.</p>

Other Asian markets also traded higher, following Wall Street's overnight gains, with the Nikkei 225 hitting a fresh record high.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California State Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill, which allows for denser housing near public transit hubs, overriding local zoning laws. Introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill aims to address California's housing shortage by enabling taller buildings near transit corridors. The bill faced criticism from local authorities who argue it strips them of promoting responsible growth, but gained support after amendments added union hiring requirements. The bill is now awaiting a final Senate concurrence vote and Governor Newsom's signature to take effect, potentially reshaping single-family neighborhoods near transit stops. Optimism score is 65.</p>
