          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly endorsed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, a move that could unify the Democratic party. Hochul, in a New York Times opinion piece, highlighted her belief in strong collaboration between state and city leadership and praised Mamdani's focus on affordability and opposing Donald Trump. Mamdani, who secured the Democratic primary with pledges for rent freezes and a $30 minimum wage, expressed gratitude for the governor's support. This endorsement suggests growing mainstream acceptance for Mamdani's progressive platform, despite earlier reservations from some party figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has granted approval for a world-first single-dose vaccine designed to protect koalas from chlamydia, a pervasive disease that is a primary cause of death and infertility among the marsupials. Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast spent over a decade developing this crucial intervention, which is expected to significantly curb the disease's rapid spread. Chlamydia can lead to blindness, starvation, and bladder damage in koalas, severely threatening their populations. This breakthrough offers a vital new strategy for conservationists, moving beyond less effective antibiotic treatments to safeguard the future of these iconic Australian animals.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers achieved a decisive 10-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants, securing a three-game series win through a renewed focus on fundamental offensive strategies. After a second-half slump, the team emphasized quality at-bats, situational hitting, and working the count, resulting in 18 hits and six walks. This offensive shift, less reliant on home runs, allowed them to build big innings and paper-cut the opposing pitching staff. Tyler Glasnow also settled down on the mound, contributing to a performance the Dodgers hope to carry into the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system under manager Ruben Amorim. Murphy observes improvements in team compactness and defensive shape, but highlights individual errors, such as Bruno Fernandes' defensive lapses when played deeper, as the root cause of conceded goals. He contends that players like Luke Shaw are also shoe-horned into uncomfortable roles. The article suggests that while the system has potential, Amorim's personnel choices are undermining the team's ability to consistently perform.</p>
