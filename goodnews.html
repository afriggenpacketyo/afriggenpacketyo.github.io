          <p>An exhibition in Shanghai is displaying rare early editions of Edgar Snow's influential book, "Red Star Over China," to commemorate the anniversary of World War II. First published in 1937, the book provided one of the earliest and most detailed Western accounts of the Chinese Communist movement and its leaders, including Mao Zedong. The event underscores the historical significance of the work in shaping international understanding of China's revolutionary period and its key figures during a pivotal moment in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, personal accounts from a mother, a surgeon, and a former police chief reveal the lasting impact of the disaster. They recount the chaos of the storm and its aftermath, including being stranded on a bridge, working to keep hospital patients alive without power, and the profound emotional toll on first responders. Despite the deep loss and trauma, their stories also serve as powerful testaments to human resilience, personal growth, and an enduring hope for the future of their beloved city.</p>

          <p>The article examines the long-term impact of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans education system, where over 4,000 predominantly Black teachers were fired in the storm's aftermath. This action led to a significant demographic shift in the teaching workforce and the rise of a charter school system, which critics say has negatively affected Black students by removing vital role models. The article highlights the work of Black-led organizations now striving to recruit and retain Black educators to restore a sense of community and cultural representation in schools.</p>

          <p>A personal finance reporter shares key lessons learned from her experience buying a wedding dress, emphasizing the importance of timing and budgeting for attire beyond just the gown itself. She explains how waiting too long to make a purchase can incur significant "rush fees," which can amount to a substantial percentage of the dress's total cost. The article advises brides to begin shopping approximately a year in advance and to create a comprehensive "attire budget" that includes alterations, a veil, and other accessories to avoid costly surprises.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advocates for Anti-Diet Approach to Children's Nutrition Amid Food Anxiety</h2>

          <p>In an interview, author Virginia Sole-Smith critiques the growing parental anxiety surrounding children's diets and the consumption of ultra-processed foods. She argues against restrictive eating habits, suggesting that diet culture's rigid rules can damage a child's relationship with food and their fundamental sense of bodily autonomy. Instead of focusing on specific "good" or "bad" foods, she advocates for ensuring children have consistent access to enough food and are allowed to develop their own preferences, which helps build trust and a healthy long-term perspective.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Republican Congressman Mark Alford of Missouri, who stands out for holding 15 public events and town halls during a congressional recess, a practice many of his GOP colleagues currently avoid. Despite facing heckling and difficult questions about President Trump's policies, particularly the new tax and spending package, Alford maintained a civil tone and actively listened to constituent concerns. The events provided a direct glimpse into voter frustrations over critical issues like cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits.</p>

The signing represents a significant investment for Newcastle, potentially addressing uncertainty around the future of their current striker, Alexander Isak, and reflecting Woltemade's rapid ascent after a breakout season in the Bundesliga.</p>

Despite this sustained and positive decline, President Donald Trump has continued to frame fentanyl as a growing crisis to justify punitive policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and trade tariffs. Public health experts attribute the drop in fatalities to improved addiction treatment and disruptions in fentanyl supply chains, expressing concern that the administration's approach could hinder further progress.</p>
