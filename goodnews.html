          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that a potential deal between Israel and Hamas is the closest the parties have come to securing the release of all hostages held in Gaza. In an interview, Rubio expressed optimism about the framework proposed by President Trump but cautioned that significant work remains, particularly on logistical details for the hostage release. He outlined a two-phase plan, with the first focusing on returning the hostages and the second on establishing a permanent governance structure in Gaza to prevent future conflict. Negotiations are set to continue in Cairo, with the U.S. stressing the need for a rapid resolution.</p>

          <p>Three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis has returned to acting after an eight-year hiatus to star in "Anemone," a film co-written with and directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The acclaimed actor clarified that he never intended to fully retire but chose to step away from one type of work to explore others, including making fiddles. He revealed that the primary impulse to act again came from the knowledge that his son would be making films. In a joint interview, the father-son duo discussed their collaboration on the film, which tells the story of a man living in self-imposed exile.</p>

This trend is highlighted by the recent appointment of Liu Jun, a former tenured Harvard statistician, to a prestigious position at Tsinghua University. He joins other globally recognized figures who have recently returned to China, reflecting a broader national strategy to cultivate and recruit top-tier scientific minds. This push is a key component of China's upcoming 15th five-year plan, signaling a long-term commitment to bolstering its domestic research and development capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Union clinched the MLS Supporters' Shield, awarded for the best regular-season record, following a 1-0 victory over New York City FC. A first-half goal from Danish striker Mikael Uhre was enough to secure the title and the top seed in the upcoming postseason playoffs. The achievement marks a significant turnaround for the club under coach Bradley Carnell, who took over in January after the team failed to make the playoffs last season. Elsewhere in the league, Lionel Messi provided three assists as Inter Miami defeated the New England Revolution 4-1, solidifying their third-place position in the Eastern Conference.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is actively testing artificial intelligence to pilot drones and fighter jets, including the XQ-58 drone and retrofitted F-16s, at Eglin Air Force Base. This initiative, dubbed "Top Gun AI," aims to develop autonomous wingmen capable of handling complex data and executing combat tasks alongside human pilots. The development is driven by the necessity to counter the growing capabilities of adversaries like China, as current war game simulations reportedly show unfavorable outcomes for the U.S. While AI can process information faster than humans, military leaders insist that for now, all life-or-death decisions will remain under human control.</p>

          <p>Discount supermarket Aldi is gaining attention for its Specially Selected Caramel Cone ice cream, which customers are hailing as a near-perfect duplicate of Ben & Jerry's popular AmeriCone Dream flavor. While the base ice cream flavors differ slightly, both versions feature fudge-covered waffle cone pieces and a caramel swirl. Shoppers have praised the Aldi product for its taste and significant price advantage, costing over a dollar less per pint than its brand-name counterpart. This ice cream is one of many product dupes that have become a hallmark of Aldi's strategy, offering consumers familiar flavors and products at a lower cost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more weight in communication than the actual words spoken, often turning simple questions into perceived accusations. Travers advises that individuals who use a harsh tone should pause and rephrase, while those on the receiving end should calmly ask their partner to try again. He suggests that couples can break negative cycles by using a "reset phrase" or gesture to defuse tension and allow for a more productive discussion.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring a proposal, prompted by President Trump, to end the requirement for public companies to file quarterly reports in favor of a semi-annual schedule. While proponents argue this would save companies money and allow for a greater focus on long-term strategy, the move could significantly impact the revenue of major accounting firms. The "Big Four" audit firms stand to lose a substantial portion of their business, with one estimate suggesting up to 15% of annual audit fees could be at risk.

Research shows that a majority of adolescents miss out on sleep due to late-night device use, a habit linked to increased rates of anxiety and depression.
