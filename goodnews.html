          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its approach of assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. The central bank anticipates inflation to worsen in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the strength of the economy but acknowledged that new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied President Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers argue in his appeal of E. Jean Carroll's defamation case. A New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her in 2019, when he denied her accusation of sexual assault. The DOJ had argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his role as president, thus warranting DOJ representation. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24.</p>

By the time he came off, Alexander-Arnold had played more crosses, entered the final third of the pitch more, and had more passes in the final third of the pitch than any of his teammates.</p>
