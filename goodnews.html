          <p>A 12-year-old Ukrainian girl, Kira Skliarova, urgently received a new heart during one of the most intense Russian missile attacks on Kyiv. The donor was a 4-year-old girl who had died in an accident, and her parents consented to the organ donation. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team risked their lives, driving through explosions to retrieve the heart and perform the complex surgery as the hospital building shook from the nearby blasts. Despite the harrowing circumstances, the transplant was successful, offering Kira a chance at a new life after years of illness.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses a reader struggling with scrupulosity, an obsessive concern with their own morality that leads to paralysis rather than positive action. The author uses rabbinic tales to argue against the humanly impossible goal of moral optimization, suggesting a healthier approach is to accept imperfection and practice self-compassion. The column posits that striving to be perfectly good can be counterproductive, and that acknowledging mistakes without self-damnation actually leads to greater personal responsibility and a more effective moral life. It reframes religious holidays like Yom Kippur not as days of judgment, but as opportunities to embrace human fallibility.</p>

With this victory, Crawford becomes the first male boxer in the four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three different divisions. In the post-fight press conference, Crawford expressed that the win was no surprise to him, while Álvarez graciously admitted he could not figure out Crawford's style. Álvarez also made a striking comment, stating he believes Crawford is a better fighter than Floyd Mayweather.</p>

          <h2>President Trump's State Visit to the UK Highlights His Mother's Immigrant Origins in Scotland</h2>

          <p>As President Donald Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the event casts a spotlight on his mother's roots as a Scottish immigrant from the Isle of Lewis. Mary Anne MacLeod, a native Gaelic speaker, was one of ten siblings who emigrated to the United States in the early 20th century for economic opportunity. This history presents a stark contrast to the Trump administration's hardline stance against what it terms "chain migration," the very process that allowed his own family to establish itself in America. Despite his frequent visits to Scotland for business, Trump has only briefly returned to his mother's childhood home once.</p>

          <p>A primary school in the Chinese city of Heihe, located on the border with Russia, has experienced a significant increase in the number of Russian students. This year, 127 new Russian children enrolled, bringing the total to 216, highlighting the strengthening people-to-people ties between the two nations. The students commute daily across the border from the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk, a journey of about 20 minutes via a new bridge. To accommodate the influx, the school has organized dedicated cross-border transportation and translation services, reflecting a broader trend of closer educational and cultural exchanges between China and Russia.</p>

          <p>The Little Arboreal Ladybird, a species typically found in continental Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. Scientists at Wild New Forest confirmed the sightings in moth traps in the New Forest and Southampton area, attributing their arrival to the hot summer weather that likely facilitated their journey across the English Channel. This discovery is part of a broader trend of winged insects, including various moths and butterflies, colonizing southern England as a result of warming temperatures. The species will now be added to the UK Species Inventory as a new arrival.</p>
