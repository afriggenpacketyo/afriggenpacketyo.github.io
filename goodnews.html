          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most-viewed film ever, accumulating over 236 million watches since its June release and surpassing the previous record holder, "Red Notice." This surprise global hit features a fictional K-pop girl band, Huntr/x, who use their musical talents and fighting skills to protect humanity from demons. The movie has garnered significant praise for its vibrant animation and its authentic portrayal of both traditional and contemporary Korean culture. Furthermore, its catchy soundtrack, crafted by K-pop industry veterans, has achieved remarkable success, with songs dominating Spotify charts and the track "Golden" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, leading to early discussions about a potential sequel.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Wednesday as investors processed China's industrial profits data and anticipated new U.S. tariffs on India. China reported a 1.5% slip in industrial profits in July, a recovery from steeper declines, while additional U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian exports, raising overall duties to 50%, were set to take effect. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw marginal gains, led by Nikon Corporation's surge on acquisition rumors, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 showed slight declines and gains, respectively. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 posted increases, with some economists noting "irrational exuberance" in the latter, though not yet a bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is launching a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to counter negative perceptions, even as National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen performing cleanup duties in public parks. While some Guard members patrol with police, about 110 are assigned to litter removal, creating unusual optics. Destination DC, the city's marketing arm, aims to build on record 2024 visitor numbers and mitigate an anticipated drop in international tourism for 2025. The campaign, profiling locals, seeks to separate "rhetoric from reality" ahead of America's 250th anniversary in 2026, which is expected to bring significant cultural renovations and millions more visitors.</p>

          <p>Third seed Coco Gauff overcame a challenging first-round match at the US Open, defeating Ajla Tomljanović 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in a nearly three-hour marathon. Despite a shaky serving performance, including 10 double faults and six breaks of serve, Gauff displayed resilience, ultimately securing the win with a backhand winner. She admitted her serve remains a work in progress, but expressed satisfaction at navigating the stressful early-round test. Gauff will now face Donna Vekić in the second round, with a potential path to the world No. 1 ranking still within reach if she can maintain a deep run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a reduced decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest contraction in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels, which have enhanced corporate profitability. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell by 1.7%. State-backed companies experienced a 7.5% drop in profits during this period, while businesses with foreign investments saw a 1.8% increase. The manufacturing and utilities sectors recorded profit improvements, contrasting with a significant 31.6% plunge in the mining industry's bottom line. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Less than eight months after the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it is nearing completion of debris removal from nearly 10,000 properties in Los Angeles County. Federal contractors have cleared 2.5 million tons of fire debris, finishing approximately four months ahead of schedule and marking the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history. This rapid progress, celebrated by local and federal officials, is paving the way for communities to transition into the rebuilding phase, with 600 permits already issued. While some homeowners reported imperfect work, the overall effort is praised for providing a foundation for healing and recovery.</p>

Key races are shaping up in North Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire, Michigan, Maine, Texas, Ohio, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska. These contests, some featuring contentious primaries and high-profile candidates like Roy Cooper and Pete Buttigieg, will be crucial in determining the Senate's majority, with significant advertising spending and political maneuvering expected.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, achieving critical milestones after a series of previous failures. The Starship upper stage reached a suborbital trajectory, deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators, and performed a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean, despite re-entry heating damaging a protective skirt and a control flap. The Super Heavy first stage also executed a planned splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. This success is a significant boost for Elon Musk's ambitions for Mars colonization and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, demonstrating progress in developing a fully reusable transport system, though many technical hurdles, especially orbital refueling, remain.</p>

The Super Heavy booster also performed an alternate landing strategy in the Gulf of Mexico. This flight is vital for Elon Musk's vision of colonizing Mars and NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon, although challenges like developing a fully reusable heat shield and mastering in-orbit refueling of super-cooled propellant remain formidable tasks that need to be perfected for deep-space missions.</p>
