          <p>Scientists in Singapore have made a significant stride in robotics by industrializing the production of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, capable of assembly in just 68 seconds. This advancement, detailed in Nature Communications, has also refined the insects' maneuverability, increasing their turning radius to over 80 degrees, confirmed through extensive testing. This "insect robot factory" aims to create a cost-effective and rapidly deployable force for critical disaster relief and search missions, especially in hazardous or confined spaces where human intervention is challenging. The innovation promises to enhance future humanitarian efforts by providing a novel tool for locating survivors and assessing damage in catastrophic scenarios.</p>

          <p>Korean Air announced a substantial $36 billion deal to acquire 103 Boeing aircraft, encompassing 787, 777, and 737 passenger and cargo jets, aimed at modernizing its fleet and maintaining competitiveness amid its merger with Asiana Airlines. This significant agreement emerged shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with US President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for increased trade with American companies and had imposed tariffs on South Korea. The purchase, which also includes a $13.7 billion deal with GE Aerospace, is projected to support around 135,000 jobs in the United States, underscoring its economic impact. This article details how this move is part of a broader trend where countries negotiating trade agreements with the Trump administration have made large Boeing orders, despite the aviation giant's recent crises.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns made a surprising move by trading veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This decision deviates from earlier reports that the Browns might carry four quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. The Raiders, facing a need for a backup due to Aidan O’Connell’s wrist injury, acquired Pickett for his 25 starts and NFL experience. This article explains how the trade leaves the backup role behind Browns' starter Joe Flacco contested between rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, with the final roster decisions due by Tuesday's deadline. Pickett's hamstring injury during training camp had previously hampered his competition for a spot in Cleveland.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad, following a previous scrub for an oxygen leak. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades after three prior failures, crucial for future autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers required for NASA's 2027 moon landing and eventual Mars flights. While Elon Musk acknowledges thousands of engineering challenges, NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to rapidly innovate, despite some experts doubting the 2027 moon landing timeline given the system's complexity.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in congressionally-allocated education funding, reversing an abrupt freeze after a multi-state lawsuit led by California's Attorney General. The funds, intended for programs like after-school learning, teacher training, and English-learner support, were withheld without clear explanation, though a White House spokesperson cited concerns over "radical left-wing agenda" misuse. States argued the impoundment was illegal under the US Constitution and the Impoundment Control Act.
