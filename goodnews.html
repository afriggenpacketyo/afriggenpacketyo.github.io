          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is moving to Canada due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on goods from China and strained relations between the U.S. and Canada. The museum, which relies heavily on Canadian tourists, has experienced a significant drop in sales due to the tariffs and a Canadian boycott of U.S. businesses. Owners Neil and Krystal King cite the instability and economic pressure as reasons for relocating, despite their love for their current location. They plan to reopen the museum in Canada to avoid the tariffs and continue serving their loyal customers.</p>
