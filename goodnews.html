        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A concrete wall erected as part of a border demarcation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan has physically divided the Armenian village of Kirants. The demarcation, based on Soviet-era maps, has caused a political crisis in Armenia and economic hardship for villagers who lost access to their land, though they have received government compensation. Despite the division and feelings of loss, many residents report a significant decrease in conflict-related violence, appreciating the newfound peace after years of cross-border fire. However, doubts remain about the long-term stability of the situation.</p>

          <p>The 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo have commenced under grueling heat and humidity, with temperatures climbing to 30°C and humidity over 90%. Despite the challenging conditions, Japan secured its first medal in the 35km race walk, bringing joy to local spectators who were unable to attend the 2020 Olympics due to the pandemic. The event has seen strong ticket sales, but concerns for athlete safety persist as a heatwave is forecast, prompting organizers to reschedule marathon start times. Several competitors required medical assistance after finishing their races due to the extreme weather.</p>

The Huskies ultimately rallied in the final quarter to secure the historic win, their first over Mater Dei in a decade.

          <p>Line dancing is shedding its old-fashioned image and enjoying a significant revival, attracting a younger demographic far from its traditional association with older generations. This renewed interest is largely attributed to its prevalence on social media platforms like TikTok and the integration of country music elements by mainstream pop artists. Instructors and participants note that classes are now filled with teenagers and young adults, and the dance style has diversified to include routines set to various music genres, from pop to rock. The trend highlights a cultural shift where the communal and fitness aspects of line dancing are finding a new, broader appeal.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has seen exceptionally strong demand in China, with pre-order sales quickly surpassing previous records. E-commerce platform JD.com reported that sales in the first minute exceeded the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, and in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai were fully booked within minutes. As a result, customers now face significant waiting periods, with delivery dates for new orders in some regions extending into mid-October.</p>
