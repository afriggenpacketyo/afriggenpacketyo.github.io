          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and immediately cease making new products with these dyes, following pressure from health officials to use natural alternatives. The company, which manufactures brands like Jell-O and Capri Sun, stated that 10% of its products contain artificial dyes and they have been investing in replacements. The FDA currently permits 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, though some states have enacted bans to restrict their use. The move reflects a broader industry trend towards healthier and more natural food ingredients, driven by consumer demand and regulatory scrutiny. The shift is intended to align Kraft Heinz with evolving consumer preferences and regulatory expectations. </p>

          <p>The Senate is progressing towards passing the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a $250 billion cryptocurrency market. The bill initially faced Democratic opposition due to concerns about corruption and consumer protection, particularly regarding President Trump's family's crypto ventures. Bipartisan negotiations led to amendments requiring disclosure of stablecoin holdings by government officials, stronger bankruptcy protections, and Treasury monitoring of suspicious transactions. While some Democrats still express concerns, the bill is expected to pass, aiming to provide regulatory clarity and safeguard against scams in the digital asset space. </p>

          <p>The PGA Tour has named NFL executive Brian Rolapp as its next CEO, succeeding Jay Monahan, who will step down at the end of 2026. Rolapp, formerly the NFL's Chief Media and Business Officer, brings extensive experience in forging media partnerships, which will be crucial as the PGA Tour renews its media rights agreements. Rolapp plans to focus on strengthening the Tour's commercial partnerships and adapting to evolving fan consumption habits. Monahan's tenure included securing significant investment and creating equity opportunities, but was overshadowed by the pending merger with LIV Golf. Tiger Woods praised Rolapp's appointment, citing his respect for the game and fresh perspective. </p>

The company stated M1 consumes less computing power than DeepSeek-R1, making it more efficient during inference and large-scale model training. MiniMax referenced DeepSeek 24 times in its technical paper, highlighting its ambition to challenge its rival. The model is built on the 456-billion-parameter MiniMax-Text-01 foundational model and employs a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture, also used by DeepSeek, along with Lightning Attention, to speed up training and reduce memory usage. </p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey has advocated for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue, urging openness to scrutiny and change from those providing evidence. This follows her report on group-based child sexual abuse in England and Wales, which led to the inquiry announced by Prime Minister Starmer. Casey addressed the Commons home affairs committee, emphasizing the need for government action and suggesting the inquiry could be completed within three years. She also discussed the report's findings regarding the ethnicity of perpetrators, urging caution in interpreting the data and stressing the importance of action over words from political leaders. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish authorities have released a report stating that the massive power outage in Spain and Portugal in April was due to technical and planning errors, not a cyberattack. Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen explained that small grid failures in southern Spain triggered a chain reaction, exacerbated by poor planning by grid operators who failed to replace a critical power plant. The outage disrupted businesses, transit systems, and internet connectivity, causing Spain to lose 60% of its electricity supply in seconds. Government analysts found no evidence of cyber-sabotage, but the incident has sparked debate about the role of renewable energy in grid stability, though officials maintain the country's commitment to transitioning to renewables. </p>

          <p>Experts are discussing whether gold could reach $4,000 per ounce, citing factors like inflation, geopolitical uncertainties, and central bank buying. Ben Nadelstein suggests that if gold maintains its percentage gains from last year, hitting $4,000 in 2025 is possible. Brandon Aversano expects gold to reach $4,000 within a year, pointing to global instability and strong central bank demand. Thomas Winmill takes a more measured approach, suggesting it may take one to two years without a serious geopolitical event. Strategies for investing in gold include maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds. (not investment advice) </p>
