          <p>Following talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that the meeting was constructive and could lead to deeper diplomatic exchanges between the two nations. Speaking to Chinese media, Wang emphasized that both sides engaged in a respectful dialogue, which helped enhance the U.S.'s understanding of China and manage their differences. The discussions took place amid rising trade tensions and were aimed at stabilizing the world's most critical bilateral relationship.

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence tools to improve their online dating experiences, with usage increasing over 333% in the past year. Apps like Rizz and Keepler function as "AI wingmen," suggesting replies, improving conversational tone, and even helping users navigate difficult situations like "ghosting." While some users find the technology boosts their confidence and helps initiate conversations, the trend raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest these tools can be helpful supplements for connection, but caution against using them as a substitute for genuine human interaction and misrepresenting oneself.</p>

          <h2>Sex Therapist Identifies Four Common Behaviors That Can Harm Relationship Intimacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychotherapist and sex therapist Chamin Ajjan, several common habits can "quietly kill" intimacy in a relationship, often hiding in plain sight. These include excessive phone use which signals a lack of presence, unresolved emotional attachments to an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that leads to self-rejection, and unmanaged stress which can act as a "brake" on desire. The article suggests couples can counteract these issues by setting screen-free boundaries, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and openly communicating about their individual stress responses. These actions help build the vulnerability and honesty that are foundational to a thriving connection.</p>

          <p>Securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely to be a process spanning several weeks, according to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine. She advises employees to view salary negotiation not as a one-time, high-stress event, but as an ongoing skill that can be developed. For optimal results, Valentine suggests initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in rather than at the annual review, when budgets are often already set. The key to a successful negotiation is patience, collaboration, and consistent follow-up, with the initial meeting focused on setting the stage for future discussions rather than achieving an immediate agreement.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, intending to engage with the company's management to unlock shareholder value. Despite owning valuable assets like Viator and TheFork, Tripadvisor's stock has traded at a discount, partly due to past governance issues under Liberty Media's control. Starboard's involvement could lead to several strategic shifts, including a focus on improving the core business's profitability or a potential sale of one of its segments, like TheFork. The move also raises the possibility of a full sale of the company, given the renewed interest from potential acquirers. (not investment advice)</p>

The match also saw Owen Farrell return from the bench and provided a strong showing for several players competing for Test spots. The win provides a significant morale boost for the team, though it was slightly marred by a head injury to Luke Cowan-Dickie.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing new funding for Ukraine's defense for the first time since taking office, according to diplomatic sources. This potential policy shift may be a signal to Russia, which has recently intensified its aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities. The move comes after the administration briefly paused some arms shipments as part of a global review. While Mr. Trump has been critical of past spending, he recently expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin and stated that Russia's actions could prompt him to send more defensive weapons, suggesting NATO partners might purchase U.S. equipment to transfer to Ukraine.</p>

His mother, a heart transplant recipient herself, was then also diagnosed with the same rare disease.

However, these findings, submitted to the journal *Nature*, were reportedly rejected twice by a review panel, highlighting contention within the international planetary science community. A Beijing-based scientist involved in the research effort described the age as the most credible number available, as it is based on the only direct physical evidence ever collected from the region.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for parents to allow their children more freedom for unstructured, animal-like physical play, such as climbing trees and roughhousing. It argues that modern society's trend toward self-domestication and safety-ism is depriving kids of essential movement that builds physical and cognitive health. The author cites experts who believe that free play develops "movement quality," which is crucial for long-term athleticism and injury prevention. By restricting such activities out of fear, parents may be hindering the development of robust motor skills and resilience that children will need throughout their lives, a loss they can never get back.</p>

          <p>Katie Gatti Tassin, author of "Rich Girl Nation," describes the high cost of beauty maintenance as an "insidious force" in women's financial lives, dubbing it the "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on aesthetic enhancements like hair, nails, and skincare creates a cycle of recurring expenses, as these are "depreciating assets" that require continuous investment. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true financial impact and then experimenting with removing them one by one. The goal is to redirect that money, time, and mental energy toward building actual wealth through saving, debt repayment, or investing.</p>

For example, the unemployment rate for nutritional sciences majors was just 0.4%, compared to 3.7% for finance majors. This reflects a growing demand for liberal arts and humanities graduates, as employers increasingly value the creative thinking and soft skills they bring, especially in an era of advancing artificial intelligence.</p>
