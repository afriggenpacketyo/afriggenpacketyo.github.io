          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, a trend that may help ease the overcapacity of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. Ninety former coal mines in mainland China are now operating as solar-power facilities, with additional projects in the planning stages. These conversion projects offer a chance to combine land restoration, local job creation, and clean energy deployment. Other countries are also pursuing similar projects, reflecting a global shift towards repurposing former industrial sites for renewable energy generation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with on passport applications, including selecting "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. The judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case, this decision acknowledges the immediate and profound negative impact that the Trump administration's passport policy has on the ability of people across the country to travel for work, school, and family.
