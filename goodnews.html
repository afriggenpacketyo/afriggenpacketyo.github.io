          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer publicly acknowledged his party's past avoidance of concerns regarding illegal immigration, pledging a comprehensive approach to the issue. He highlighted the growing popularity of Reform UK as a significant challenge for both major parties. Starmer is expected to announce a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as part of Labour's strategy to address increasing small boat migrant crossings. This article frames his remarks as a push for "patriotic national renewal" while defending Labour's approach against "toxic" solutions from other political factions.</p>

Ganguly identifies India as a key market for AI-native app development, expecting some Indian companies to become market leaders.

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors alleging illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books to train chatbots. The agreement, which pays authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per book, does not cover future works. While the court previously ruled AI training constitutes transformative fair use, this settlement addresses claims about how materials were obtained. The article highlights a significant milestone in authors' fight against AI companies' infringement, signaling a push towards legal licensing and fair compensation.</p>

          <p>A California Senate bill, inspired by an 8-month-old whose sleep was disturbed by loud streaming commercials, seeks to regulate ad volume on platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. Federal law already covers traditional TV, but streaming services are currently exempt. Due to California's market influence, this bill, if signed into law, could effectively set a national standard, impacting consumers nationwide. Despite strong opposition from the Motion Picture Association, the article highlights the widespread consumer frustration and the potential for significant change in the streaming industry's advertising practices.</p>
