          <p>President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since pausing reciprocal tariffs. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and reduce non-tariff barriers.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% after the announcement, with further trade deals in the works with other countries like Canada, Italy, India and Japan.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a three-year plan to modernize the U.S. air traffic control system, replacing outdated infrastructure with state-of-the-art technology. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that this initiative aims to enhance safety, reduce delays, and unlock the future of air travel. The plan involves replacing radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, along with building six new air traffic control centers and upgrading existing facilities. The proposal seeks emergency supplemental funding to address critical infrastructure needs, as officials emphasize the FAA's struggle to manage a rapidly growing and complex aviation sector.</p>

The government defends the proposals as necessary to encourage more people to find work and to ensure welfare spending is sustainable. The Labour government is not at risk of defeat, given Labour has a large majority, but a sizable rebellion could show the extent of the discontent within the party.</p>
