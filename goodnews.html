          <p>Mao Saigo shot a 6-under 66 to take the second-round lead at the US Women‚Äôs Open at Erin Hills, holding a three-stroke advantage over a group of six golfers including Nelly Korda. Saigo, who previously won the Chevron Championship, expressed her determination to perform her best without comparing her potential score to past tournaments at Erin Hills. Korda, who has had a complicated relationship with the US Women's Open, recorded her best round in the event with a 67. The article details Saigo's recovery from an unlucky break on the 14th hole and her subsequent strong performance. The event was temporarily suspended due to weather concerns, but Kim remains in contention despite a late bogey.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers mounted a sixth-inning rally against the New York Yankees, mirroring their historic comeback in the previous year's World Series.

Freddie Freeman contributed with a momentum-swinging double, and Andy Pages delivered a game-tying single. The Dodgers overcame an early deficit, with Tony Gonoslin surrendering four home runs in the first four innings, to secure a crucial win amidst a challenging stretch of the season, which included Mookie Betts being scratched with a toe problem and Evan Phillips being ruled out for the season.</p>
