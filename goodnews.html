          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie advanced to the second round of the US Open after his opponent, American Sebastian Korda, was forced to retire due to injury. Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had recently returned to tour action following a shin stress fracture, ended the match, appearing to struggle with an abdominal issue. Norrie admitted to feeling "very nervous" before the match, especially against an opponent who had beaten him in three of their four previous encounters. He expressed sympathy for Korda's unfortunate early exit from the tournament.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move aimed at revitalizing KDP's struggling U.S. coffee division. Following the announcement, KDP shares fell 11%, while JDE Peet's stock surged 15%. The acquisition, anticipated to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years, is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Keurig Dr Pepper plans to subsequently split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding their 2018 merger to create two focused entities.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, clarified that he is not in the market to acquire another railroad company, despite recent market speculation. Instead, he met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss fostering greater cooperation between their respective companies to enhance freight rail efficiency. This statement follows the announcement of a partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX to provide new coast-to-coast rail services. Consequently, CSX shares closed about 5% lower, and other railroad stocks also dipped as the prospect of a major takeover faded.</p>

Performing groups represented traditions from various Caribbean nations and Brazil, alongside established UK community bands. Despite expectations of over a million attendees, police reported "far fewer incidents of serious violence" than in recent years, though two non-life-threatening stabbings occurred. Carnival chair Ian Comfort emphasized the event's importance for unity and its need for continued government funding to ensure safety and preserve its legacy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media firm X and artificial intelligence company xAI have filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, alleging anticompetitive behavior in the rapidly evolving AI industry. The suit claims that the partnership between Apple and OpenAI, which integrates ChatGPT into iPhones, creates an unfair monopoly and hinders competitors like xAI's Grok chatbot from scaling and innovating. This legal action further escalates Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whom he previously accused of fraud. xAI contends that its requests for deeper integration with Apple's iOS ecosystem have been denied.</p>

          <h2>Markets Expect September Fed Rate Cut, But Future Pace Remains Uncertain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets are pricing in a near-certainty of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, influenced by Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks at Jackson Hole. However, investor caution emerged regarding the pace of subsequent cuts, with much less certainty for further reductions in October or December. Experts from firms like Morgan Stanley express skepticism, citing persistent tariff-induced inflation and a resilient economy, questioning the urgency for aggressive easing. Concerns also linger about potential unintended consequences, drawing parallels to last year's bond market reaction to rate cuts, which could undermine White House hopes for lower financing costs.

Coach Sean McVay expressed confidence in both players' recovery trajectories, emphasizing Jackson's crucial role in protecting Stafford's blindside, signaling improved stability for the Rams' offensive line.</p>

          <p>California has successfully maintained a relatively steady share of union-represented workers, hovering between 16% and 18% over the past two decades, thereby bucking a national trend of declining union membership. This stability is primarily attributed to consistent and active new organizing campaigns within the state, particularly in the medical industry, large hospitals, and at companies like Starbucks. While some unions, such as United Food and Commercial Workers, reported declines due to automation, California's proactive approach contrasts with the gradual national decrease, demonstrating the impact of sustained labor efforts in the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump held his first meeting with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, where he expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again in the future. Discussions also centered on the US-South Korean trade deal and Trump's call for the US to take ownership of land for its military bases in South Korea, urging increased financial contributions. Hours prior, Trump had issued vague social media criticisms about a "purge or revolution" in South Korea, later referencing "vicious raids on churches" by the new government, which he walked back as a potential misunderstanding. Despite initial tensions, the leaders appeared amicable during their public remarks, with Lee praising Trump's peacemaking efforts.</p>
