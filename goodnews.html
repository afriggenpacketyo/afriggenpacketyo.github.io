          <p>NATO leaders agreed to a new defense spending goal of 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, significantly increasing the previous target of 2%. President Trump praised the agreement as a win for the United States, having consistently urged NATO allies to increase their defense spending. In 2024, NATO members spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Poland is estimated to spend the highest percentage of its GDP on defense, while Spain allocated the smallest share, leading to criticism from Trump.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno became first-time homeowners by constructing their own homes through the Mutual Self-Help Housing (MSHH) program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to build homes collectively, reducing costs and fostering community. The project, located in the Annadale neighborhood, represents a $1.46 million investment from the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis. The families worked alongside construction staff, learning skills like pouring foundations and wiring, while contributing to the revitalization of a historically underserved community.</p>

This strategy aims to enhance supply chain resilience and avoid tariffs by establishing manufacturing bases in countries like Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Morocco.

The directive requires both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to loan closing. The FHFA director stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary offers potential lessons for Democrats, although caution is advised when extrapolating national trends from a municipal election. Mamdani's success highlights the importance of charisma, authenticity, and effective communication across diverse media platforms. His focus on affordability and economic issues, combined with a populist message, resonated with voters. The attacks on Mamdani's views on Israel did not have the intended effect, indicating a possible shift in the politics of Israel within the Democratic Party.</p>
