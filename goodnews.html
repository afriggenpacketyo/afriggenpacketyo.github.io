          <p>Construction has officially commenced on a new ballroom at the White House, involving the demolition of a portion of the East Wing. President Trump confirmed the project, which he stated is fully funded by $250 million in private contributions from businesses and tech companies, costing taxpayers nothing. The new addition is intended to host large events and state visits, with a planned capacity of nearly 1,000 people. Despite initial assurances that the project would not interfere with the existing structure, video and reports confirm that part of the East Wing, which houses the first lady's offices, is being torn down.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Melissa in the Caribbean, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season. Currently located south of Haiti, the storm is moving west with maximum sustained winds near 50 mph. While a gradual turn to the north and northwest is expected, there is significant uncertainty in its long-term track and intensity forecast. A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica, with risks of heavy rainfall and flash flooding. At present, the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI chatbot, placing it in direct competition with Google's Chrome and other AI-integrated browsers. The browser allows users to access ChatGPT's capabilities, such as summarizing content and completing tasks, directly on any webpage without needing to switch tabs. A key feature is its agentic capabilities, enabling the AI to take actions like booking flights or reservations for the user. The announcement caused shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, to drop by about 3%, signaling a potential shift in the competitive landscape of web browsing and search.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has been knocked out of the Women's World Cup following a 150-run defeat to South Africa in a match heavily impacted by rain in Colombo. South Africa posted a formidable total of 312-9 in their 40-over innings, driven by half-centuries from Laura Wolvaardt, Sune Luus, and Marizanne Kapp. After multiple rain delays, Pakistan's chase was reduced to a target of 234 from 20 overs, but they were restricted to just 83-7. The victory sends South Africa back to the top of the table, while Pakistan joins Bangladesh in being eliminated from the tournament with one group match remaining.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, named Mango House, has developed a successful and self-sustaining business model by primarily serving refugee and immigrant patients on Medicaid. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic defies conventional wisdom that Medicaid is unprofitable by maximizing efficiency through a walk-in-only system, streamlined administrative tasks, and an in-house pharmacy. By focusing on volume and ease of access, the clinic sees about 100 patients a day while keeping wait times short. This unique approach allows it to provide consistent care to a vulnerable community, remaining financially stable even with potential fluctuations in Medicaid coverage.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat surged dramatically, jumping over 90% on Tuesday after a more than 120% rise on Monday. The rally was triggered after Roundhill Investments added the heavily shorted stock to its Meme Stock ETF, seemingly igniting a short squeeze. The stock, which had fallen to penny-stock status, also benefited from news of expanded distribution through a deal with Walmart. This remarkable turnaround for the struggling company could be a sign of a speculative, frothy market, as retail traders show renewed interest in volatile meme stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock soar by over 15% after the automaker reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year financial guidance. The company now forecasts adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion for 2025, signaling confidence despite challenges in the electric vehicle market. GM's strong performance was bolstered by its China operations and international markets, which helped offset a decline in North American profit margins. The company also announced a reduced financial impact from tariffs, partly due to recent policy updates from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Omaha to Los Angeles was diverted and returned to its departure airport after pilots declared an emergency, believing the cockpit was being breached. According to the FAA, the incident was a misunderstanding caused by a faulty internal communication system. The pilots heard knocking on the cockpit door but were unable to reach the cabin crew via the plane's phone system, leading them to initiate emergency protocols. It was later determined that the knocking was from the flight attendants trying to communicate with the pilots. Airport officials confirmed there was no security-related incident.</p>

A former Forest academy player himself, Dyche emphasized the need to get back to basics, improve performances, and give the fans something to cheer about. His first match in charge will be a Europa League game against Porto, as he aims to unify the club and reverse its poor run of form.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors suggest investors may find opportunities in the current economic climate. Unlike previous rate-cutting cycles during major crises, the current cuts are happening amid a relatively strong economy, creating a unique situation. Advisors recommend a balanced approach, suggesting strategies like investing in intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds to lock in higher yields without taking on excessive risk. Maintaining a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes remains a key principle to navigate the uncertainty of future Fed policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, student loan servicers, which are government contractors, continue to operate normally for billing, payments, and processing requests like forbearance. Borrowers can also seek assistance from non-profit organizations and state-level student loan ombudsmen for help navigating their education debt during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Indonesia has agreed to repatriate Lindsay Sandiford, a British grandmother who has been on death row for over a decade after being convicted of drug trafficking in 2013. Sandiford, now in her late 60s and seriously ill, was arrested in Bali with cocaine valued at over $2 million. She claimed she was coerced by a syndicate that threatened her son's life. The repatriation agreement, signed by Indonesia's law minister and the British foreign minister, also includes another British national serving a life sentence for drug offenses. This move is part of a recent trend by Indonesia to release several high-profile foreign detainees.</p>
