        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco poked fun at Jeff Bezos' physical transformation during a stand-up routine at Cannes Lions 2025. Maniscalco joked about Bezos' evolution from a "complete nerd" to a "shredded" billionaire on his yacht. He also humorously commented on Amazon's packaging practices, highlighting the contrast between large boxes and small items. The comedian's routine coincided with Bezos and his fianc√©e Lauren S√°nchez's public appearances ahead of their wedding, and Maniscalco praised Bezos as a "genius" for his business acumen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newer COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, is associated with a severe sore throat, nicknamed "razor blade throat," and has been detected in several states. This variant, derived from the omicron variant XVD.1.5.1, is classified as a "variant under monitoring" by the WHO. It accounts for an estimated 37% of cases in the U.S. and appears more transmissible due to changes in the spike protein. Experts recommend high-risk individuals receive bi-annual vaccinations and practice good hygiene, although there is no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or hospitalization.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has emerged as a center of resistance against immigration raids, with community patrols alerting immigrants to ICE activity. Since the Trump administration intensified raids, migrant communities have sought support and solidarity. Community patrols, created in 2020, have become a symbol of resistance, helping to prevent detentions. In response to the raids, marches have taken place to condemn anti-immigrant policies, and organizations are providing resources and assistance to those affected. Despite the fear caused by the raids, the community remains vigilant and united in defending the rights of immigrants.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution. Local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced the share of plastic bags collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full or partial bans. California's experience shows that stricter laws with fewer loopholes are needed to make a measurable difference in reducing plastic waste, as the state is now implementing a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags.</p>

          <p>'28 Years Later,' directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, is praised as an excellent horror film that shakes and moves viewers in equal measure.

The film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and Alfie Williams, with Williams's performance particularly highlighted. The film's visual style, shot largely with iPhones 15 Pro Max, is described as constantly engaging, and the overall result is considered explosive and outstanding.</p>

Civil rights advocates scrutinized the prosecutions, arguing that authorities misrepresented events and criminalized free speech.

          <p>Diego Luna revealed that he was primarily offered roles as drug dealers before his involvement in 'Star Wars.' The actor shared his experiences with Latinx typecasting in Hollywood, noting that he was often asked to clean up his accent. Luna emphasized the importance of representation and staying true to one's unique identity. His presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation, although they remain underrepresented in lead roles.</p>

          <p>President Joe Biden will participate in a Juneteenth Celebration Service at the historic Reedy Chapel AME Church in Galveston, Texas. The church is one of the locations where the order announcing the end of slavery in Texas was read in 1865. In 2021, Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday, commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. Juneteenth serves as a day to remember the moral stain and toll that slavery took on the country.</p>
