        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary was significantly influenced by the organized, grassroots Palestinian protest movement. The author contends that Mamdani's vocal support for Palestinian liberation, once considered a political liability, resonated with a shifting public discourse and mobilized a dedicated base of volunteers. The article suggests his win is not just a result of a progressive economic platform but a testament to the power of activists who saw him as an alternative to an establishment that overlooks the Palestinian cause.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are transitioning from a niche cryptocurrency asset to a mainstream financial tool, with major corporations like Visa, Mastercard, and JPMorgan developing their own tokens. These firms aim to leverage stablecoins to reduce transaction fees and enable instantaneous, 24/7 payment settlements. The trend is supported by growing regulatory clarity, such as the Senate's GENIUS Act, which provides a framework for their use. This corporate adoption signals a shift towards using stablecoins as a fundamental infrastructure layer for moving value, potentially reshaping global payment systems. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is actively fighting against unauthorized data scraping by AI firms, recently suing Anthropic for allegedly using its content to train large language models without permission. While facing the challenge of AI chatbots potentially replacing direct website traffic, Reddit is also embracing AI by launching its own "Reddit Answers" feature. This tool provides AI-generated responses based solely on its platform's discussions, aiming to offer authentic human perspectives that contrast with more sterile AI answers.</p>

          <p>Journalist and public broadcasting pioneer Bill Moyers has passed away at the age of 91, leaving behind a profound legacy in American media. Starting as a reporter and later serving as press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson, Moyers returned to journalism to create influential PBS programs for six decades. He was celebrated for his in-depth interviews not just with newsmakers but also with poets, scholars, and moral leaders like Elie Wiesel and Desmond Tutu. Remembered for his probing yet compassionate questioning, Moyers consistently sought to tell stories that reached into the human heart.</p>

The second half was entirely one-sided, with the Lions adding five more tries to their tally, including a second for both Tomos Williams and Elliot Daly.

The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician lynched in 1924, successfully connecting with one of his living relatives. Founded in 2021, the interracial coalition researches these forgotten histories, collects soil from lynching sites for a national memorial, and confronts a painful past that many local residents were unaware of. Their work is seen as a vital form of resistance against efforts to erase Black history.</p>

          <p>In a unique business move, Trader Joe's has opened a new store in Sherman Oaks, California, directly across the street from one of its existing locations that has been operating since 1973. The original plan was to close the older, smaller store, but the company decided to keep both open to serve the high volume of customers in the area. The new store is significantly larger and features underground parking, addressing common complaints about congestion and tight parking at the original location. While some customers are excited about the upgrade, many loyal shoppers plan to continue visiting the cozier, more familiar 1973 store.</p>

This will be enabled by a constitutional change and a special $117 billion fund, allowing for massive investment without immediate cuts to social programs.

The case exemplified the government's COINTELPRO program aimed at dismantling Black nationalist groups. After 27 years in prison, Pratt's conviction was overturned when the concealed evidence came to light, exposing a story of official corruption and a justice system that failed.</p>

          <p>In a significant local political rebuke, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries from conservative city council actions. Measure A dismantled a parent review board that would have controlled children's book selections, while Measure B blocked the privatization of the library system. The victory for the "Protect HB" coalition is seen as a grassroots pushback against the council's MAGA-aligned agenda, which had sought to censor books with LGBTQ+ themes. Organizers hope their nonpartisan, community-focused campaign can serve as a model for resisting political overreach elsewhere.</p>
