          <p>This article details the significant growth of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) over nearly 25 years, transforming from a five-state border security group into a comprehensive Eurasian body addressing security, economic, trade, and diplomatic challenges. It highlights the bloc's expansion to include 26 countries, including observer states and dialogue partners across Asia, Europe, and Africa, with nations like Myanmar and Turkey seeking full membership. The narrative traces key milestones, such as its renaming from the "Shanghai Five" in 2001 and the signing of its foundational charter in 2002. This evolution underscores the SCO's increasing geopolitical relevance and its ambition to project a new global order. The organization now serves as a platform for diverse nations to collaborate on multifaceted issues, reflecting its journey from a regional security focus to a broader international influence.</p>

          <p>Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson has completed a permanent move from Manchester City to Turkish club Fenerbahce for £12.1 million, after eight successful years with City. During his tenure, the 32-year-old helped the team secure six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, and a Champions League title, making 372 appearances. His departure comes as Manchester City reportedly agreed to a £26 million deal to sign Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain. Ederson expressed pride in his achievements, including 122 clean sheets and seven assists in the Premier League, marking the end of a highly decorated period at the club.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has commenced a two-day trip to Bengaluru, India, with the primary objective of strengthening strategic ties between Germany and India. Wadephul emphasized the vast potential for collaboration across various sectors, including security cooperation, technology, innovation, and skilled worker acquisition. He described India as a "central global partner" for Germany's economic and strategic ambitions. A key focus of the visit is to expedite the planned free trade agreement between India and the European Union to elevate economic relations. During his time in Bengaluru, India's "Silicon Valley," he is scheduled to meet students and visit the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a compelling review of Netflix's new documentary, "America’s Team: the Gambler and his Cowboys," asserting its superiority to "The Last Dance" due to its unflinching honesty and comprehensive depiction of the Dallas Cowboys' 1990s dynasty. The film unearths controversial aspects, such as the team's "White House" gatherings, instances of player arrests, and the enduring power struggle between coach Jimmy Johnson and owner Jerry Jones. It features remarkably candid interviews, with Jones revealing his cancer battle and players openly discussing concussions and the raw culture of that era. The article commends the documentary makers for their meticulous research and willingness to expose deeper, often uncomfortable, truths, presenting a refreshing departure from typical, more sanitized sports narratives.</p>

          <p>Manchester United signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, prioritizing him over Emiliano Martinez as part of their long-term "Project 150" strategy to win the Premier League by 2028. This decision reflects a focus on future development, as Lammens' data analysis showed exceptional qualities in shot-stopping and progressive passing, despite his limited experience. The club believes Lammens, who will be 26 during "Project 150," offers better long-term value than the 35-year-old Martinez. This strategic move, made amidst a challenging transfer window, underscores United's commitment to data-informed recruitment and building for sustained success.</p>

          <p>The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, were observed across large parts of the UK on Monday night, extending from northern Scotland down to Norfolk and Kent. This rare widespread visibility was caused by a strong solar storm, specifically a coronal mass ejection detected by satellites monitoring solar activity. The increased solar energy interacted with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, producing the vibrant purple, green, and red hues. Space weather forecasters confirmed a "moderate geomagnetic storm" and suggested activity could intensify to a "G4 Severe storm" on Tuesday night, potentially making the aurora visible even to the naked eye across the entire UK.</p>

          <p>Guyana is holding a presidential election, with nearly 750,000 citizens voting to determine leadership amidst the nation's newfound oil riches. The incumbent People's Progressive Party faces opposition from A Partnership for National Unity and the newcomer We Invest In Nationhood party. The winning party will manage an estimated $10 billion in annual oil and gas revenue, yet despite being one of the world's largest oil producers per capita, 58% of Guyanese live in poverty, making the rising cost of living a key voter concern. The election also unfolds amid simmering territorial disputes with Venezuela, including a recent accusation of shots fired at an election commission boat in the oil-rich Essequibo region.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United concluded a challenging transfer window by selling star striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool for a British record £125 million, while acquiring Yoane Wissa from Brentford for £55 million and Nick Woltemade. This move, initially against the club's plans, became necessary amidst Isak's desire to leave and the need to navigate profit and sustainability rules. The article details Newcastle's difficulties in securing top targets and the strategic shift towards players "desperate" to join, such as Malick Thiaw. The club also made a significant appointment in technical director Sudarshan Gopaladesikan to enhance data-informed recruitment, aiming for long-term financial flexibility and on-field success.</p>

The median age of first-time U.S. homebuyers has reached a record 38, highlighting a nationwide housing shortage exacerbated by high inflation and interest rates. Despite legislative incentives like low-interest construction loans, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started. While broader zoning changes faced resistance, individual developers like Jed Nilson are finding success by partnering with counties to build more homes on smaller plots, demonstrating a path towards greater affordability and upward mobility for young families.</p>

The cube-shaped device, slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase, uses only 400ml of water per cycle, delivered as an ultra-fine mist through ultrasonic atomisation, to clean up to 800 grams of clothing. Instead of traditional detergent, it utilizes ultraviolet light to produce ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes clothes for up to five wears.
