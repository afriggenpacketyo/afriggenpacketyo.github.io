          <p>Germany's leading industry organization has expressed optimism following Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with US President Donald Trump, hoping for an easing of trade tensions between the EU and the United States. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) views the meeting as a positive signal for transatlantic relations and a boost for ongoing tariff negotiations. German firms, particularly those in AI, robotics, and mechanical engineering, are heavily invested in the US, but investment has slowed due to Trump's trade policies. While Trump has temporarily paused some tariffs, Brussels and Washington are struggling to resolve the dispute.</p>
