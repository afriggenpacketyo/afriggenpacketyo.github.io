          <p>With personal loan and credit card rates remaining high, homeowners are increasingly looking to tap into their home equity. This article details the current average interest rates for home equity loans and HELOCs, which are significantly lower than other borrowing options. It explains the functional differences between the two loan types, noting that home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum while HELOCs provide a variable-rate line of credit.

          <p>Following a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, seafood chain Red Lobster is attempting a comeback by leaning into nostalgia and affordable pricing. The company has launched an ad campaign featuring *NSYNC's Joey Fatone, revived classic menu items, and introduced value-focused deals like $20 lobster rolls. This strategy aims to tap into consumers' emotional connections with the brand and offer a sense of familiarity and comfort. Branding experts suggest this approach, which contrasts with other chains' less successful modernizations, could help the legacy restaurant reinvent itself and reconnect with multiple generations of customers.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling a portion of its holdings in Broadcom to rebalance its portfolio after the stock's significant outperformance. The stock has gained approximately 55% year-to-date, with a recent surge attributed to the company's strong AI chip business and a new mystery customer, reportedly OpenAI. This decision is described as a disciplinary move to right-size the position, not a change in belief about the company's long-term prospects. The sale will realize a substantial gain on shares purchased in September 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City secured a decisive 3-0 win against Manchester United, a result attributed to superior tactics and execution. This analysis details how City manager Pep Guardiola exploited weaknesses in United's defensive system, particularly by creating overloads in midfield and using player "pinning" to open up space. The article examines how City's left-sided play, involving Jeremy Doku and Phil Foden, confused United's defensive assignments, leading to breakdowns. It questions whether Manchester United's struggles are due to personnel or a faulty system, highlighting City's adaptability versus United's rigid philosophy under manager Ruben Amorim.</p>

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are facing growing competition for the breakfast crowd from convenience stores, which are increasingly investing in their food service offerings. Recent market data shows that while morning traffic to fast-food chains grew by only 1%, visits to food-focused convenience stores jumped by 9%. Chains like Wawa and Casey's are winning over consumers with quality, variety, and the perception of good value. This trend is impacting major players like McDonald's, which has noted that breakfast is its weakest and most economically sensitive part of the day, as stressed consumers opt to eat at home or find cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>2025 has been a remarkable year for the horror genre, with films like "The Conjuring: Last Rites" and "Sinners" driving the domestic box office past the $1 billion mark for the first time since 2017. What sets this year apart is that many of these successful films are also receiving significant critical acclaim, positioning them as potential awards contenders. This trend marks a shift towards greater respectability for a genre often seen as a low-budget moneymaker. Many of the new wave of successful horror directors, such as Jordan Peele and Zach Cregger, got their start in comedy, a genre that shares surprising structural similarities with horror.</p>
