          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula prompted widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While the quake caused flooding in Russia with 16-foot waves, the impact elsewhere was less severe than initially feared, with most warnings later downgraded to advisories. Hawaii experienced minor flooding and waves up to five feet, leading to evacuations but no major damage. The event tested emergency response systems and highlighted the unpredictable nature of tsunamis, which can consist of multiple waves over several hours.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining a range of 4.25% to 4.5% due to an uncertain economic outlook and persistent inflation. The policy statement noted that while economic growth has moderated, the labor market remains solid. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the economy is in good shape but faces risks, suggesting the central bank will await more data before considering any future cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, surpassing forecasts and reversing a 0.5% contraction from the previous quarter. This growth was significantly influenced by a sharp decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which statistically boosts GDP. Economists caution that this headline figure may overstate the economy's underlying strength, as a key measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since 2022. Despite the skewed data, the report suggests the economy is slowing but not heading into a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies have made a significant move before the MLB trade deadline, reportedly acquiring All-Star closer Jhoan Duran from the Minnesota Twins. To secure the hard-throwing reliever, the Phillies are sending top prospects, including right-hander Mick Abel and catcher Eduardo Tait, to Minnesota. Duran, known for his triple-digit fastball, is expected to bolster the Phillies' bullpen as they aim for a World Series run. The trade is also a long-term investment, as Duran remains under team control through the 2028 season, strengthening a key area for the contending team.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Limited Damage from One of the Strongest Earthquakes on Record</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded at magnitude 8.8, the recent temblor off Russia's coast caused surprisingly little damage outside its immediate vicinity. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with modern deep-ocean sensor networks that provide timely warnings, resulted in a best-case scenario for a potentially catastrophic event. The incident served as a successful test of tsunami preparedness and highlighted the importance of an earthquake's specific characteristics.</p>

          <p>A recent cultural analysis suggests that audiences are increasingly drawn to anxiety-inducing television shows over traditional "comfort TV." Series like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which use hyperrealistic, single-take filmmaking to immerse viewers in high-pressure environments, have achieved critical and popular success. The essay posits that these shows resonate because they offer a cathartic reflection of real-world stress and a desire for authenticity. This trend marks a shift away from the pure escapism that dominated television during the pandemic, indicating viewers may be seeking to process their own anxieties through grounded, relatable stories.</p>
