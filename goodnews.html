          <p>President Donald Trump hosted an exclusive black-tie gala for top buyers of his meme coin, who collectively spent $148 million for the chance to attend; however, the event was met with mixed reviews. While the dinner showcased opulence with attendees sporting expensive watches, some guests found the food disappointing and security lax. Trump made a brief 23-minute appearance, delivering crypto talking points but not interacting with most attendees, leading to some attendees checking their phones during dinner to see if the price moved. The price of President Donald Trump's meme coin plunged 16% as of Friday morning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and expediting the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. The orders mandate the NRC to decide on reactor licenses within 18 months and focus on small, advanced reactors, while also supporting the construction of large plants. These changes seek to address regulatory delays, which Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez identifies as a major obstacle for the nuclear industry. The orders also establish a framework for the Energy and Defense departments to build reactors on federal land for national security purposes, while uranium mining is expected to get a boost.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has approved the merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing the previous administration's block on national security grounds. Trump stated that the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. The decision led to a surge in U.S. Steel shares, closing over 20% higher. This move follows Trump's April order for a review of the acquisition, contrasting with President Joe Biden's earlier concerns about supply chain risks.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security revoked its ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit accuses the administration of unconstitutional retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. Harvard President Dr. Alan M. Garber condemned the action, stating it imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars. The university argued that the administration's demands were unprecedented in scope and that Harvard had complied with the requests.

The goal is to minimize human interaction and avoid conflicts once the cub is released. The cub is expected to remain at the center for up to a year and could be paired with another orphaned cub to aid its development.</p>

The loss of contact occurred because a temporary control tower antenna was not optimally positioned. Federal air traffic controllers also had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's location. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address safety concerns. The helicopter was following its approved flight path, according to the Army.</p>

          <p>If the IRS is garnishing your wages due to unpaid taxes, tax relief options can help stop the garnishment. Strategies such as installment agreements, offers in compromise, and currently not collectible status can provide relief. Innocent spouse relief is also an option if the debt resulted from a spouse's actions. Engaging a tax relief professional can assist in negotiating with the IRS and requesting a garnishment release while a resolution is pursued. It is important to act quickly to explore these options and prevent further financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing difficulty walking, trouble controlling the bladder, and memory problems. The condition is likely underdiagnosed because its symptoms can easily be dismissed as normal effects of aging. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that drains the excess fluid. Early diagnosis and treatment can often reverse the symptoms.</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club has initiated contact with Bayer Leverkusen regarding a potential transfer for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz. The Germany international is a primary target for new Liverpool manager Arne Slot as the club plans for the upcoming season. While formal negotiations have not yet begun, Liverpool has expressed its desire to sign the 22-year-old. Bayer Leverkusen values Wirtz at over ¬£120 million, and it remains to be seen if Liverpool is willing to meet that price. Wirtz reportedly favors a move to Anfield over Bayern Munich.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced it will close its CosMc's chain, a beverage-focused spinoff, after only two years. The decision involves shuttering all standalone pilot locations and discontinuing the CosMc's app, beginning in June. The chain was created to compete with Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, offering customized beverages. McDonald's plans to incorporate some of the new drinks from CosMc's into its McDonald's menus. The company stated that the test allowed them to experiment with new flavors and technologies without affecting the McDonald's experience.</p>
