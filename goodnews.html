          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 07:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With record heat impacting global infrastructure, roads, rails, and bridges face significant challenges such as melting asphalt, buckling tracks, and expanding bridge joints. Experts suggest solutions like heat-reflective coatings for roads, using tree-based resins for pavements, and replacing timber sleepers with reinforced concrete on railways. Bridges can be climate-proofed with bearings that absorb larger movements and regular inspections after extreme temperature events. These adaptations are crucial to maintaining safe and efficient transportation systems in a warming world. Optimism is tempered by the scale of the challenge, but these measures offer a path forward. </p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rebound in premarket trading following a sharp decline triggered by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that a potential truce between Musk and Trump, possibly brokered through a phone call, could alleviate concerns surrounding Tesla's stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes that the reconciliation of Musk and Trump would be a positive development for Tesla, given their mutual needs. The recent verbal exchanges between Musk and Trump stemmed from Musk's departure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate confiscated cryptocurrencies through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, aiding the city's virtual asset hub ambitions. The municipal Public Security Bureau is partnering with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to sell seized cryptoassets via regulated platforms in Hong Kong. CBEX will appoint third-party agencies to manage the sales, converting proceeds into yuan for deposit in designated accounts. This marks the first instance of a mainland agency detailing a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets using Hong Kong's virtual asset regime, given mainland China's strict ban on crypto trading. </p>

          <p>Russia's central bank has lowered interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first rate cut since September 2022, signaling a decrease in inflation pressures. The inflation rate in April was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025, suggesting a gradual return to balanced growth. Despite ongoing conflict with Ukraine and dwindling hopes for a ceasefire, the ruble has performed well this year due to capital controls and policy tightening. The central bank plans to maintain tight monetary policy to achieve its 4% inflation target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds used for growing crops by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprising given the relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery highlights the extensive farming practices of Native Americans before European colonization and offers insights into their agricultural systems. </p>
