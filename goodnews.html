        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation sparked by a single victim tracking their stolen iPhone has led to the dismantling of an international criminal gang responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen phones from the UK to China annually. The Metropolitan Police operation, the largest of its kind in the UK, uncovered a network that exported a significant portion of all phones stolen in London. The gang allegedly paid street thieves up to £300 per device, which could then be sold for as much as £4,000 in China. So far, 18 suspects have been arrested in connection with the sophisticated, industrial-scale operation.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma jumped 7% following an announcement by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that its technology will be integrated into ChatGPT. During OpenAI's DevDay conference, Altman demonstrated how users could prompt ChatGPT to use Figma to create a workable diagram from a simple sketch. This integration is part of OpenAI's new Apps SDK, which allows third-party applications to connect directly with the popular AI chatbot. The partnership is expected to enhance Figma's functionality by leveraging generative AI, providing a significant boost to the company's market presence and stock value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, savers are evaluating the best placement for their funds. An analysis of a $10,000 deposit shows that earnings from a high-yield savings account and a certificate of deposit (CD) are currently very similar over various short-term periods. However, the fixed rate of a CD offers guaranteed returns, whereas the variable rate of a high-yield savings account is likely to decrease with future rate cuts. The article suggests a strategy of using both to balance guaranteed earnings with liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is becoming a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. A new analysis shows that a $150,000 HELOC currently has a monthly payment of approximately $1,811 for a 10-year term or $1,424 for a 15-year term. These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago, and the variable interest rate means payments will likely decrease further with future Fed cuts. The article advises that while a HELOC of this size can be manageable for those with sufficient equity, homeowners should carefully consider their ability to handle fluctuating payments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For senior homeowners considering a reverse mortgage, lenders typically require at least 50% to 60% equity in the home to qualify for the most common type, a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). While the FHA does not set a strict percentage, this threshold is a standard industry practice. The actual amount that can be borrowed is not the full equity value but is instead determined by the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. Homeowners who fall short of the equity requirement may need to pay down their existing mortgage or consider downsizing to become eligible. (not investment advice)</p>
