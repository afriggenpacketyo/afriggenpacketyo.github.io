        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is investing in automating logistics, including testing AI-powered humanoid robots for package delivery, aiming to reduce costs. Morgan Stanley estimates potential savings of $2 billion to $3 billion annually by 2030 with robotics-enabled warehouses. The company is reportedly testing these AI-powered humanoid robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. The firm views humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of "more durable market share gains" in Amazon's logistics network, which already holds a 30% share of the U.S. parcel delivery market, surpassing UPS and FedEx. The deployment of humanoids could yield significant financial returns in the next 3-5 years. (not investment advice) </p>

He received a call that the defibrillator was used to save a 30-year-old woman, marking a proud moment for him. Sullivan also trained local Sherpas and villagers in emergency medical instruction, emphasizing the importance of access to defibrillators, and is now planning to train 1.2 million students in CPR through a school initiative. </p>

As a Hall of Fame point guard, Kidd also played for the Knicks in his final season, adding a layer of familiarity to his potential candidacy. </p>

Currently, the U.S. depends on foreign sources for about 70% of its reactor fuel, including Russia, which will be phased out by 2028.

          <p>Despite a recent and intense social media feud, Donald Trump and Elon Musk remain connected through political funding, government contracts, and personal relationships.

Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, conduct extensive business with the U.S. government, giving Trump leverage.

SpaceX's dominance in satellite launches and NASA's reliance on its spacecraft make it difficult to replace the company. The situation is further complicated by Musk's involvement in the Artemis program and plans for a mission to Mars. </p>
