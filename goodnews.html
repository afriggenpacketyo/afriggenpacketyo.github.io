          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously agreed that Greg Abel will succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, aims to reassure investors by maintaining Buffett's guidance during the transition. Buffett emphasized that Abel will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment, although Buffett will assist with major acquisitions. Despite the announcement and somewhat disappointing earnings, Berkshire shares only slightly declined, reflecting the market's confidence in the company's stability and future leadership.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 06:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes after criticism that the 100% rate was excessively burdensome for beneficiaries, though experts still warn that even a 50% clawback can cause significant financial strain. Overpayments occur for various reasons, such as unreported changes in circumstances or agency errors, and beneficiaries have a limited time to request a lower rate or waiver. The agency estimates the 100% rate would have generated $7 billion in savings over a decade, but the revised rate aims to balance program savings with individual financial stability.</p>

          <p>The Real ID deadline is approaching, requiring Americans to switch to the enhanced form of identification by May 7 to travel domestically by plane. Dozens of states are behind on compliance, and residents over 18 without a valid U.S. passport will need a Real ID-compliant driver's license or nondriver ID to fly domestically or visit certain federal facilities. Enhanced IDs are also an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card, but some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments. The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on their 30 years as a history professor studying California and its people, emphasizing the crucial role of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in making this work possible. Despite being underfunded, the NEH has supported over 70,000 projects, including numerous books, films, and publications of historical figures' papers. The author's own studies of colonial California, funded by the NEH, have contributed to a broader understanding of early America and allowed thousands to trace their ancestry. The NEH's funding, though a small percentage of the federal budget, has had a significant impact on the nation's cultural fabric and is essential for understanding the past and present.</p>

          <p>China is questioning the West's ability to sustain an advanced technological society in the long term, citing its own "strategic stamina" as an advantage. This critique follows China's development of a thorium molten salt reactor, building on research abandoned by the United States. The Chinese engineer behind the project contrasted his team's persistence with the perceived fickleness of Western counterparts. While the technical challenges of molten salt reactors remain significant, China's long-term view and focus on engineering-led innovation pose a civilizational challenge to the West.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his role in ensuring the constitutional transfer of presidential power on January 6, 2021. Pence repeatedly invoked the Constitution, emphasizing its importance as the common ground binding Americans together. His comments came after an interview with President Trump aired, where Trump was noncommittal on whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment. Pence has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to take on the Trump administration, campaigning against Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and urging support for Ukraine.</p>
