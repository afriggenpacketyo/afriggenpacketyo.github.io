          <p>Ecuador has extradited powerful gang leader Adolfo Macías Villamar, known as "Fito," to the United States to face charges of drug and arms trafficking. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His organization is linked to Mexican cartels and is blamed for a surge in violence that has transformed Ecuador, a key transit point for cocaine. The extradition represents a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:55:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed a bioinspired nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal testing. The innovative approach targets cancer stem cells, which are responsible for tumor growth and spread, offering a potential new avenue for creating personalized cancer vaccines. Published in Nature Nanotechnology, the findings represent a significant step forward in the fight against cancer. The research could pave the way for more effective, long-term treatments for patients.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Utilize 'Power Law' to Identify High-Potential Startups</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on the 'power law' principle when making investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive, outlier returns. This strategy acknowledges that the vast majority of a fund's profits will come from a very small number of highly successful companies, such as a Spotify or Klarna. To attract VC funding, founders are advised to demonstrate "outsized-outcome potential" and craft a compelling, visionary story about how their company can define a new category. This approach prioritizes huge potential wins over smaller, more certain gains.</p>

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure supplies after a preliminary trade deal eased export controls. These magnets are critical for high-tech manufacturing, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, and China dominates over 90% of the global market. The increase in shipments follows Beijing's approval of new export licenses, providing relief to industries that had faced shortages, though it also highlights significant U.S. supply chain dependency.

          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has proposed the most significant reforms in over 30 years, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. The report, authored by Sir Jon Cunliffe, makes 88 recommendations to tackle widespread issues like underinvestment, sewage spills, and leaking infrastructure. While acknowledging that consumer bills will rise to fund over £100 billion in necessary upgrades, the proposals aim to ensure better long-term resilience and prevent future crises by prioritizing continual investment over suppressing bills.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham. It will also examine the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described as "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, cautiously welcomed the news as a step toward truth and justice.</p>
