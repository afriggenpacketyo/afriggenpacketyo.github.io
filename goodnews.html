          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the September 2022 mini-budget, the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has dropped to 4.99%. Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point" indicating increased competition among lenders. However, with inflation forecasts rising, experts suggest that rates are unlikely to fall substantially further, even as 1.6 million homeowners are expected to remortgage their deals this year. The current rates remain significantly higher than the levels seen before the 2022 fiscal event. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar, scientists are analyzing the event's data to enhance earthquake forecasting, though they emphasize prediction remains impossible. The quake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, caused thousands of deaths and widespread destruction. A new study published in PNAS used the quake's data to create a model that suggests the fault has a "memory effect," with large-magnitude events occurring irregularly every 141 years on average. While precise predictions are not feasible, such forecasting models are crucial for improving disaster planning and building preparedness in seismically active regions.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an intelligent breeding factory that uses a combination of AI-driven robotics and "robot-friendly" gene editing to speed up the development of new hybrid crops fivefold. By genetically modifying plants to have parts that are more accessible to robots for tasks like pollination, the system can automate the breeding process. This breakthrough, detailed in the journal Cell, allows for the creation of new plant varieties with desirable traits like improved flavor and disease resistance in just one year, compared to the five years required for manual methods. The technology promises to revolutionize agriculture and reduce reliance on costly human labor.</p>

          <p>A ranking by the betting website Action Network has named California the best state for stargazing, a conclusion that has been met with some skepticism from professional astronomers. The website's analysis considered factors like sky visibility, elevation, and astronomical infrastructure. However, experts, including Griffith Observatory director Ed Krupp, question the methodology, particularly the focus on spotting asteroids, which are not visible to the naked eye. While agreeing that California has excellent Dark Sky Places like Joshua Tree and Death Valley, astronomers emphasize that enjoying cosmic events often depends more on escaping local light pollution and moon phases.</p>

          <p>An artist and his wife have replaced their 1956 Monterey Park home with a new, modern structure designed around their swimming pool, creating what they call a "continuously evolving piece of art." The project, designed by their architect nephew, blends Chinese and American cultural elements, reflecting the couple's heritage. The house features an 80-foot-long curving deck that wraps around the pool, creating a series of indoor-outdoor rooms and framing views of the Los Angeles skyline. The design thoughtfully integrates the owner's art and aims to serve as a future space for public salons and cross-cultural exchanges.</p>

          <p>Actress Rashida Jones reflects on her Emmy nomination for the "Black Mirror" episode "Common People," where she plays a woman whose consciousness is saved by a predatory subscription service.

          <p>This article assesses the Emmy chances for actress Uzo Aduba, nominated for lead actress in a comedy for her role in the Netflix whodunit "The Residence." Despite being a three-time Emmy winner and a six-time nominee, her path to a fourth win is complicated. The series was canceled after just one season, and she faces a highly competitive category that includes past winners like Quinta Brunson, Ayo Edebiri, and Jean Smart. While many actors have won Emmys for canceled shows, prognosticators often rank Aduba last due to the stiff competition, though her strong track record with voters means she cannot be entirely counted out.</p>

          <p>As tariffs and expiring incentives make electric vehicles (EVs) more expensive, this article highlights the few models available for under $35,000. Options include the all-electric Nissan Leaf and Hyundai Kona Electric, as well as the Toyota Prius and Kia Niro plug-in hybrids. The average price for a new EV is over $56,000, making affordability a major barrier to adoption in the U.S. Experts note that while cheaper models are available, the industry faces challenges from high battery costs and the phasing out of a $7,500 federal tax credit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant travel trend has emerged, with a growing number of Czech tourists choosing Poland's Baltic coast over their traditional holiday destination, Croatia. This shift is attributed to a desire for milder summer climates and is facilitated by new, direct train links and toll-free motorways. Polish media and officials have noted the "Czech invasion," with some estimates suggesting up to 800,000 Czech visitors this year. The trend also reflects a broader Czech admiration for Poland's recent economic development, which has seen it catch up to and, in some areas, surpass the Czech Republic.</p>
