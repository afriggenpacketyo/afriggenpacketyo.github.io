          <p>The British pound has risen to its highest level in over three years, trading around $1.36, although analysts are divided on whether it will continue to climb. While the pound has surged against the U.S. dollar, it has depreciated against the euro this year. Some analysts attribute the pound's strength to dollar weakness and potential future fiscal boosts in Europe, while others are more pessimistic, citing the UK's economic momentum and the possibility of Bank of England rate cuts.

          <p>This article addresses the claim that NATO expansion drove Russia to war in Ukraine, a justification often used by the Kremlin. While Putin has expressed concerns about NATO's eastward expansion since 2000, NATO insists it is a defensive alliance. The article examines whether NATO promised not to expand eastward following German reunification, considering statements from Western leaders and Gorbachev's perspective. Despite differing interpretations, the article concludes that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is incontrovertibly wrong, regardless of any past assurances.</p>
