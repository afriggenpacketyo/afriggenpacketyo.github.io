          <p>A party yacht named "Timeless" struck a dock pylon on the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street. The incident occurred around 4:15 p.m. while the 200-foot boat was attempting to dock near Riverside Park. Thirty-five people sustained non-life-threatening injuries, with twenty-two requiring hospitalization. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, and the yacht sustained some damage as well, but overall the partygoers were grateful that nobody died in the accident.</p>

          <p>Jeanne Pepper and Gideon Bernstein, parents of Blaze Bernstein who was murdered in 2018, have channeled their grief into a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward." Blaze was targeted and killed because he was a gay, Jewish man by Samuel Woodward, a neo-Nazi. The couple has founded a kindness movement promoting positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, and in Borrego Park, hundreds of hand-painted stones left by strangers commemorate Blaze's life and promote tolerance. Sam Woodward was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are implementing "property supermarkets," both online and offline, to aid the struggling housing market. Chengdu is the latest city to launch a homebuying platform in partnership with state-owned and private developers, and similar initiatives have been introduced in cities like Suzhou and Shandong. These platforms aim to improve transparency, streamline services, and minimize false promotions by centralizing information and bundling services like mortgage applications and property registration, and these efforts seek to revive China's property sector amid declining housing prices and subdued buyer sentiment.

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband Bob was overturned after she spent two decades in prison, and new testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign male DNA. Dorotik always maintained her innocence and worked with Loyola Project for the Innocent to push for re-examination of the evidence, and the prosecution admitted that the new DNA test results cast doubt on the verdict. Despite the overturned conviction, Dorotik's case was dismissed without prejudice, leaving open the possibility of charges being brought again if new evidence surfaces.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese ambassadors from West African nations have recently concluded their tenures, leading to speculation about the reasons behind these departures. While some analysts suggest routine rotations, others propose it could be a subtle message to Sahelian regimes concerning resource nationalism and security concerns. The departures include ambassadors from Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, all of whom have played roles in strengthening Sino-African relations.</p>
