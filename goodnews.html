          <p>The article explores the tradition of Hawaiian lei making, a practice introduced by early Polynesian settlers over 1,000 years ago. Leis are used to express aloha, love, and welcome, and are given for various occasions. The article details the intricate process of lei making, where a single lei can use hundreds of flowers. However, the tradition is facing challenges due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the increasing import of flowers from other countries.
