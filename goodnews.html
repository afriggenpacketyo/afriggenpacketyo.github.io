          <p>The White House announced a $600 billion investment deal with Saudi Arabia, including what it calls the "largest defense sales agreement in history." President Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed agreements for judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and an international partnership program between the Saudi Ministry of Interior and the FBI. The agreements signal Trump's intent to deepen U.S.-Saudi ties, despite concerns about human rights. High-profile business leaders, including Elon Musk and Larry Fink, attended a business lunch with the leaders. Trump also suggested Qatar would donate a jumbo jet for his use as Air Force One.</p>

          <p>General Motors is set to pioneer new EV battery technology, aiming to reduce costs and boost profitability for its largest electric SUVs and trucks. The new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells are expected to be used in full-size electric vehicles beginning in 2028. These batteries use more prevalent, less expensive minerals like manganese instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel. GM expects to be first to market with the new batteries, after Ford announced its intention to launch LMR batteries before 2030.</p>

          <p>Inflation retreated again in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline. The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April from 12 months earlier, down from 2.4% in March, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021. Economists, however, warn that tariffs levied by President Donald Trump are expected to re-ignite inflation. A 10% average tariff rate would add as much as 1 percentage point to the consumer price index after about six to nine months.</p>
