          <p>The United States and China have agreed to resume trade talks following a period of escalating tensions, establishing a "framework" to solidify terms of a deal initially reached in Geneva last month. This agreement comes after two days of negotiations aimed at de-escalating the trade war between the two superpowers. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the framework awaits approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping. If approved, this framework could lead to the implementation of measures to ease trade disputes and potentially avoid further economic friction between the two nations. The agreement provides a basis for future negotiations but does not guarantee concrete breakthroughs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gregory May, the current US consul general for Hong Kong and Macau, is anticipated to transition into a leading position at the United States' Beijing embassy. This move comes at a critical juncture in the relationship between Beijing and Washington, as both nations engage in high-stakes discussions to manage escalating trade and export control measures. May's pragmatism and experience covering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are seen as valuable assets in assisting Ambassador David Perdue. His role would involve connecting with various Hong Kong communities and maintaining business, academic, and people exchanges.

He criticizes the secrecy surrounding the death penalty in Japan, comparing it to the situation he encountered in Mongolia. Elbegdorj emphasizes that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and poses the risk of wrongly convicting individuals.
