          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded with mixed results as investors keenly awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated. Japan's Nikkei 225 index remained largely flat, though government data showed the country's exports declined less than expected in August, influenced by U.S. tariffs and earlier export front-loading. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed significantly, buoyed by Baidu's successful offshore bond offering and its new AI collaboration with China Merchants Group. However, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, a key indicator of global demand, plunged notably in August, missing economists' forecasts and following a previous decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major technology companies, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, and Salesforce, have collectively announced plans to invest more than $40 billion into the United Kingdom's artificial intelligence infrastructure and development. Microsoft alone committed a substantial $30 billion by 2028, aiming to build the UK's largest supercomputer in collaboration with a British cloud computing firm. These significant commitments, made during President Donald Trump's state visit, are poised to solidify the UK's position as a global leader in AI innovation.

          <p>China's private space company, Space Pioneer, announced a significant milestone for its large reusable Tianlong-3 rocket, which successfully completed a crucial ground test. The 35-second burn involved nine Tianhuo-12 engines firing simultaneously, generating an impressive nearly 1,000 tonnes of thrust. This achievement, described as "the most complex and challenging ground trial," signals that the Tianlong-3 has passed its "major exam" and is now entering the final stages before its anticipated launch by the end of this year. The company aims for an ambitious schedule of over 30 commercial missions annually once operational.</p>

The duo demonstratively signaled for a traveling violation, a gesture that quickly gained viral attention on social media. Later in the game, Clark playfully mimicked the gesture when a travel call was finally made against Atlanta. The Fever went on to win the game, tying the series, though they will continue their playoff run without their two biggest stars.</p>

The operation, led by David Rodriguez and Raymond O’Connell, allegedly utilized a downtown Los Angeles jewelry store as a front to facilitate the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of drugs and proceeds between Los Angeles and New York City. Law enforcement seized over $2.8 million in cash, 1,600 pounds of cocaine, and various high-end assets during the extensive investigation.</p>

As part of this effort, he announced the creation of a "no bureaucracy email alias" for employees to flag inefficient processes, leading to changes in hundreds of internal procedures.

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a milder contraction than expected in August, falling by just 0.1% year-on-year, an improvement from July's 2.6% decline, though marking the fourth consecutive month of negative growth. This softer contraction was primarily attributed to a rebound in shipments to Asia, its largest trading region, and a notable 7.7% jump in exports to Western Europe. These gains partially offset a significant 13.8% drop in exports to the U.S., which continues to be impacted by U.S. tariffs.
