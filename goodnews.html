          <h2>China's Panda Diplomacy Faces Uncertainty in Japan</h2>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo, as these animals have historically symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits to Japan. However, some experts doubt the diplomatic weight of this gesture, especially considering ongoing tensions over historical and territorial issues. China has long used pandas as a tool of diplomatic outreach, signaling goodwill to various nations, but it remains uncertain whether this will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic posture or public opinion.</p>

          <h2>Five Phrases Parents Should Avoid to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests parents avoid phrases that trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, such as "Because I said so" or "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]." Instead, she recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy and promotes cooperation, such as explaining reasons for decisions or framing requests as choices. By fostering emotional safety and involvement, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England for those meeting strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. NHS England plans a staggered approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and resources. Some practices warn patients not meeting the criteria to avoid booking appointments, and pharmacy trade organizations are concerned demand will outstrip supply. The drug, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, makes users feel fuller, aiding weight loss, and wrap-around care will also be provided.</p>

          <h2>China's Rise to Electric Vehicle Dominance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:17:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country being electric. The Chinese government's long-term planning and significant subsidies have been instrumental in this success. Wan Gang, a German-trained engineer, played a key role in shifting China's focus to EVs, and the government has spent billions developing the industry. This has allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production and build the world's largest public charging network, attracting young consumers with affordable EVs and top-of-the-range technology.</p>

          <h2>Ketamine Treatment for Severe Depression May Be Offered on NHS</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:12:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a clinic by year's end offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy, which combines ketamine infusions with psychotherapy. While ketamine is unlicensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors, and it's been used recreationally for its effects. The Royal College of Psychiatrists urges caution but will publish updated information on psychedelics, and it is hoped that ketamine treatment will become more widely available.</p>

Muncy's grand slam in the sixth inning erased a deficit, and his strong performance continued his impressive mid-season turnaround. Ohtani's pitching debut showed progress, striking out two in a scoreless inning.</p>
