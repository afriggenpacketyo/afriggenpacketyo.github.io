          <h2>Former Pentagon Official Highlights Significant Shift in U.S. Policy Towards China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a former Pentagon official, recent direct talks involving Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have signaled a major change in the United States' approach to China. In his discussions, Hegseth reportedly clarified that the U.S. is not seeking conflict, regime change, or the economic strangulation of the People's Republic of China. This statement is viewed as a remarkable and significant shift from previous American stances, running counter to China's current assessment of U.S. intentions. The ex-official emphasized that this is a crucial development that the Chinese side should recognize and respond to, potentially opening a new chapter in diplomatic relations between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Shares for Chinese technology giant Alibaba experienced a significant jump after a state media report revealed a major new customer for its artificial intelligence chips. China Unicom, a leading state-owned telecommunications operator, will deploy AI accelerators from Alibaba's semiconductor unit, T-Head, in a new data center project. This partnership underscores China's strategic push to utilize domestically produced semiconductors for AI, especially as access to foreign technology like Nvidia's faces uncertainty. The deal is seen as a major win for Alibaba's cloud and chip divisions, reinforcing its position as a key player in China's competitive AI landscape and boosting investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Joel Willett, a former CIA officer whose security clearance was recently revoked by the Trump administration, has announced his Democratic candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat long held by Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. Willett frames his run as a response to what he calls the weaponization of government against dissenting voices, an experience he claims to have faced firsthand. His campaign launch focuses on concerns about democratic institutions, economic inequality, and the fentanyl crisis, which has personally affected his family. The 41-year-old military veteran is part of a new generation of Democratic candidates aiming to challenge established political figures by highlighting both national and deeply personal local issues.</p>

          <p>In her campaign for Virginia governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is highlighting endorsements from two former Republican members of Congress, Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman. This show of bipartisan support is being featured in a new advertisement where they praise her as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress and frame their support as being about what's best for Virginia, not party loyalty. The move comes as early voting begins in a closely watched race, which is seen as a potential bellwether for national politics during Donald Trump's second term. Spanberger is competing against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in a state that has trended Democratic but remains politically competitive.</p>

The research found that uses like practical guidance, information seeking, and writing assistance constitute the majority of conversations. Notably, practical guidance, including requests for tutoring and how-to advice, was the most common use case overall. The study also observed that ChatGPT's user base is becoming more diverse, with the gender gap narrowing and rapid adoption in low- and middle-income countries. Researchers suggest the findings indicate the AI is being used more as a tool to improve productivity and judgment rather than to replace human workers.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook conveyed strong optimism about the company's efforts to build an end-to-end silicon supply chain within the United States. In a recent interview, Cook highlighted Apple's substantial financial commitments, part of a $600 billion investment in domestic manufacturing, including a $2.5 billion pledge to a Corning glass factory in Kentucky. He expressed that he is "really pleased" with the progress, pointing to investments in Taiwan Semiconductor's new U.S. plant and deals for rare earth magnets. Cook affirmed that advanced manufacturing can be done competitively in the U.S. and noted that Apple maintains a positive and constant dialogue with the Trump administration about these domestic investments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts predict a significant shift in how Chinese companies raise funds offshore, with a growing preference for yuan-denominated bonds over traditional U.S. dollar bonds. Issuance of "dim sum bonds" in Hong Kong is on track for a record year as companies seek cheaper financing options amid high U.S. interest rates. This trend aligns with Beijing's broader goal of promoting the internationalization of the yuan and supporting the overseas expansion of Chinese corporations. Experts at a recent forum noted that expanding the yuan bond market is in China's national interest, providing its companies with more accessible and cost-effective funding in international markets.

          <p>Donald Trump's affinity for the British royal family, deeply influenced by his Scottish mother's admiration for Queen Elizabeth II, has been a consistent theme throughout his life and political career. This fascination with the monarchy's pomp, status, and glamour will be evident during his second state visit to the UK, an unprecedented honor for a U.S. president. From allegedly offering Prince Charles a free membership to Mar-a-Lago in the 1990s to his expressed regret at never courting Princess Diana, Trump has long sought association with the royals. Observers suggest this reflects a desire for the legitimacy and global status that he believes the British throne represents.</p>

          <p>StubHub, the online ticket resale platform, has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, resulting in a company valuation of $8.6 billion. The pricing fell in the middle of its expected range and successfully raised $800 million. The company, which was reacquired by its co-founder in 2020, had delayed its public debut twice before, most recently due to market volatility. The successful IPO marks another positive sign for a rebounding market, following other strong debuts from companies like Klarna and Gemini. StubHub reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue from the previous year, though its net loss also widened during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that complex mummification practices existed in southern China and Southeast Asia as early as 12,000 years ago. An international team of researchers analyzed 54 pre-Neolithic burials and found evidence that many bodies were intentionally smoke-dried over long periods, often in tightly bound, crouched positions. These findings place the origins of large-scale mummification in the region far earlier than the previously known oldest examples, such as Chile’s Chinchorro mummies from 7,000 years ago and early Egyptian practices from 4,500 years ago. The study provides new insight into the sophisticated mortuary rituals of ancient hunter-gatherer societies in Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The zarf, a Turkish word for "envelope," refers to the ornate holders used to handle small, hot cups of Turkish coffee, particularly during the Ottoman era. These functional yet decorative items were symbols of luxury, sophistication, and rank, often crafted from metals like silver and gold and adorned with intricate designs or jewels. While the modern cardboard coffee sleeve may share a similar purpose, the traditional zarf represents a rich cultural ritual recognized by UNESCO for its importance. Though rarely used in daily life today, these historical artifacts serve as a reminder of a time when coffee serving was considered a sophisticated art form and a statement of elegance.</p>

However, her fear quickly turned to gratitude when three men from the encampment rushed to her aid. They worked together to push her car safely out of traffic, and one man, Dominic, stayed with her to ensure her safety while another biked to get her gasoline. The men, who asked for nothing in return, provided help and reassurance in a stressful situation. Cobb was deeply impacted by their selfless generosity, noting that these individuals, despite their own difficult circumstances, were the ones who came to her rescue.</p>
