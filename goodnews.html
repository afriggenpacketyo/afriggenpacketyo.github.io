          <p>One of the Big Bear bald eaglets, Sunny, successfully took its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. After days of practice flapping and jumping, Sunny jumped off a branch and flew away, eliciting elation from observers. While Sunny's whereabouts are currently unknown, it's common for young eagles to return to the nest shortly after their initial flight. The eaglets, now nearly 13 weeks old, are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own in the fall, with their future whereabouts unknown as they are not banded.</p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a legendary figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89, according to the Yomiuri Giants. Nagashima was a key player for the Giants, leading them to nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the club. His charisma and popularity transcended sports, and he became a household name during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Known as "Mr. Giants," Nagashima's game-winning heroics and flashy fielding helped professional baseball surpass the traditional university game in popularity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans, according to an Education Department spokesperson. This decision marks a policy shift, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause offers older student borrowers, particularly those over 62 who are in default, additional time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. The administration aims to protect Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes.</p>

Samuel Mehr, one of the study's authors, encourages parents to sing any song they like, not just traditional lullabies.
