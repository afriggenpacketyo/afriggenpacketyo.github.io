          <p>A Kremlin aide has indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to meet in the near future. This follows Trump's statement about a "good chance" of a three-way summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the war, an idea Zelensky has supported. The potential talks emerge as a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face more severe sanctions approaches. Despite recent discussions between a U.S. envoy and Putin being described as "highly productive," expectations for a breakthrough remain muted as the conflict continues.</p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced significant flight disruptions across the United States after a "technology issue" prompted a temporary nationwide ground stop for its mainline flights. The halt affected major hubs including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, leading to over 700 delays as of Wednesday evening. The airline confirmed the underlying problem was resolved but warned passengers to expect residual delays as normal operations were being restored. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted the issue was specific to United Airlines and not related to the broader U.S. air traffic control system, with the airline treating it as a preventable delay for passenger compensation purposes.</p>

Discussions have included strengthening collaboration in the peaceful application of nuclear technology, particularly in agriculture. This expansion builds on existing projects, such as the two Hualong One third-generation nuclear reactors that China exported to Pakistan. These reactors, located at a facility in Karachi, are a cornerstone of the countries' ongoing tech and energy relationship, each capable of generating over 10 billion kilowatt-hours of power annually.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As wildfires intensify globally due to climate change, experts are emphasizing proactive strategies to make forests more resilient to fire. Global heating is creating hotter and drier conditions, increasing fire risk even in once-humid regions like rainforests. Key prevention methods include rehabilitating natural, fire-resistant deciduous forests and reducing fuel loads by clearing dry undergrowth through grazing or controlled burns. Other tactics involve creating wide, vegetation-free firebreaks, which can be watered to slow flames, and planting "green firebreaks" of less flammable native trees around communities. These measures, combined with rapid detection, are crucial for adapting to the growing threat.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has reported its second straight profitable quarter, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its technology-focused Vision Funds. The Japanese conglomerate posted a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and reversing a loss from the previous year. The positive performance was attributed to gains in publicly traded companies like Grab and private investments, reflecting early returns on the company's aggressive spending on artificial intelligence. This includes a leading role in a $40 billion funding round for OpenAI and a proposed acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German authorities have arrested three men suspected of belonging to the far-right "Reichsbürger" (Reich Citizens) terrorist group. The arrests followed raids across Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia targeting individuals believed to be part of a network aiming to violently overthrow Germany's government. The suspects allegedly participated in firearms training in 2022 to prepare for a potential armed assault on the German parliament. The Reichsbürger movement rejects the legitimacy of the modern German state, and this operation is part of ongoing efforts to dismantle the group following the arrest of its key leaders in December 2022.</p>

          <p>A major retrospective in Bonn, Germany, is celebrating the expansive five-decade career of filmmaker Wim Wenders as he turns 80. The exhibition showcases his work across film, photography, and writing, all unified by the theme of movement and discovery. Wenders, a key figure in the New German Cinema movement, is renowned for his road movies like "Paris, Texas" and contemplative films such as "Wings of Desire" and the recent "Perfect Days." His work often explores themes of solitude, connection, and the search for belonging, frequently using travel as a central narrative device to understand the world and the self.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 02:44:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which would mark its lowest level in over two years. This would be the fifth reduction since last August, aimed at stimulating an economy that has shown no growth in recent months. While a lower rate could reduce monthly mortgage costs for homeowners with variable-rate loans, it will also mean diminished returns for savers. The decision comes even as UK inflation recently rose to 3.6%, though signs of a cooling employment market may be weighing on the Bank's considerations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry, signaling a recovery from a recent historic crisis. A bumper olive harvest in Spain has led to a 50% drop in raw material prices, allowing the company to lower shelf prices and stimulate consumer demand. This follows a turbulent period marked by poor yields, extreme weather, and high inflation that caused prices to soar. The maker of brands like Bertolli and Carbonell now anticipates a more balanced and normalized market, doubling its investment in advertising to reinforce olive oil's status as a household staple.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong growth, with exports rising 7.2% and imports jumping 4.1% year-over-year, the biggest import increase in a year. This performance beat economists' expectations and was supported by a surge in exports to regions like Southeast Asia, which offset a continued decline in shipments to the U.S. The robust data comes as a tariff truce with the U.S. approaches its expiration, with significant duties still looming over U.S.-bound goods. Key export categories showing growth included rare earths, automobiles, and semiconductors, while soybean and crude oil imports also saw substantial increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, less than five months after returning from a challenging mission aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Wilmore and crewmate Suni Williams piloted the first crewed Starliner flight, which was troubled by technical issues that extended their planned eight-day stay on the International Space Station to over nine months. The duo ultimately returned to Earth on a SpaceX capsule due to safety concerns with their original vehicle. NASA praised Wilmore's dedication and "legacy of fortitude," noting his extensive service included four different spacecraft and 464 total days in space.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some financial experts are arguing that China's risk from its massive local government debt is being brought under control, contrasting with what they see as a more concerning federal debt situation in the United States. Through a sweeping debt-restructuring campaign, including bond swaps, China has enabled local governments to extend their repayment timelines, with the average maturity of new bonds lengthening significantly. Proponents of this view note that since China's debt is largely held at the local level, the central government has more room to intervene and manage the risk, a different scenario from the U.S. where the burden is at the federal level.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Environment Agency is introducing enhanced checks on tyre exports after a BBC investigation revealed that millions were being illegally sent to makeshift furnaces in India instead of being recycled. The agency acknowledged it is "highly likely" that a portion of UK tyres were diverted to this process, known as pyrolysis, which causes serious health and environmental damage. Starting in October, exporters must prove that the waste tyres are being managed in an environmentally sound manner. While campaigners welcome the move, some, including the Tyre Recycling Association, are disappointed that it falls short of a full ban on whole tyre exports.</p>
