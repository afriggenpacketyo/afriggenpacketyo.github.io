          <p>The New York Knicks secured a decisive 119-81 victory over the Boston Celtics, eliminating the defending champions and advancing to their first Eastern Conference finals in 25 years. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 23 points, leading a dominant performance by the Knicks. Six Knicks players scored in double figures, marking the franchise's largest play-off winning margin. The Knicks will face the Indiana Pacers in the next round, while the Celtics struggled, missing Jayson Tatum due to a ruptured Achilles tendon, as Jaylen Brown led their scoring with only 20 points.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, filling gaps in understanding the diverse populations of South America. Researchers found that early settlers split into isolated groups, with genetic traits evolving to adapt to different environments, such as the Andes. The study highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge for Indigenous people's identities and tailored healthcare.</p>

Lowry slammed his club and swore after being denied relief for an embedded ball, while Hatton swore at his driver after a poor tee shot. Both golfers are likely to face fines for their on-course behavior. Hatton finished the day one under par, seven shots behind the leader, while Lowry missed the cut by a single shot.</p>

Taiwan's foreign ministry stated both countries notified them in advance and relations remain friendly and stable.

Trump announced over $2 trillion in economic investments from the three nations, praising their upfront payments.

Judge Shelley Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape through a back door of her courtroom. The charges against Joseph were later dropped, and she was investigated by the Massachusetts Commission on Judicial Conduct.

The UAE's efforts are part of an ambitious plan to increase its influence over global supply chains and diversify its economy away from fossil fuels.
