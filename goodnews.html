          <p>China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet is poised for a significant international breakthrough, as the CEO of AirAsia's parent company confirmed active discussions to purchase the aircraft. This would make it the first major foreign airline to place an order for the C919, which is manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac). The single-aisle jet is designed to compete directly with the popular Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 models. The growing interest in the C919 reflects expanding economic ties and flight connections between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Following a successful market debut where its stock climbed 14.5%, financial technology company Klarna is still considered a worthwhile investment at its current levels, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer. He highlighted the Swedish "buy now, pay later" firm's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and impressive automated underwriting standards as key strengths. Although the company is not yet profitable due to aggressive expansion into new markets, its earnings losses have been shrinking. Cramer noted that while he prefers competitor Affirm, Klarna's current valuation of over $17 billion is not yet excessive, suggesting potential for further growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 19:24:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced legislation to significantly reform Measure ULA, the controversial Los Angeles property sales tax often called the "mansion tax." The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, aims to address criticisms that the tax has stifled the construction of new apartment buildings and other commercial properties. The bill would lower the tax rate from 4-5.5% to 1.5% for newly constructed commercial and multi-family residential buildings sold within 15 years of being built. This move is part of a broader political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA entirely.</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor announced a major leadership overhaul, appointing former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and naming co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The news was met with strong investor approval, causing the company's stock to surge 30% in extended trading. These changes follow a period of intense pressure from investors, including Rabois himself, which led to the resignation of the previous CEO last month. The company, which had been at risk of delisting from the Nasdaq earlier in the year, has seen a dramatic turnaround in its valuation, fueled by recent interest from retail investors.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Investigate 'Dark DNA' to Understand Peacock Spiders' Rapid Diversification</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 19:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. They hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' 'dark DNA'—the vast, non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. These spiders possess three times more dark DNA than humans, and scientists believe it may enable them to adapt and evolve into new species with unique colors and mating dances very rapidly. By decoding the genetics of these extreme examples of variation, the project aims to uncover fundamental principles of evolution that apply across the natural world.</p>

          <p>Economic cooperation between China and Kazakhstan is set to expand, particularly in the realm of cross-border e-commerce, following a new agreement involving Freedom Holding. The deal, which includes partnerships with UnionPay Business and a virtual payment provider, aims to simplify payment channels between the two nations by opening accounts in both yuan and U.S. dollars. This initiative is designed to build interoperable platforms that facilitate trade flows while adhering to high regulatory standards. The agreement underscores the growing economic relationship, as Kazakhstan has become a primary destination for investments under China's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan measure to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq from 1991 and 2002. Lawmakers from both parties argued that these decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military action without contemporary congressional approval. The vote reflects a growing movement in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. The amendment, attached to the annual defense spending bill, passed with a vote of 261 to 167 and now moves forward as part of the larger legislative package.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to preliminary data from the CDC for 2024. After peaking as the third leading cause of death in 2021, COVID-19 has steadily declined, though it remains a significant cause of mortality, ranking in the top 15. The data also shows an overall 4% decrease in U.S. deaths last year, continuing a downward trend. Heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death, accounting for over 40% of all fatalities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his high school for the time being. The decision lets a lower court's injunction remain in place while the student's lawsuit against a state policy restricting bathroom access proceeds. The state rule ties school funding to compliance with the ban. The Supreme Court's unsigned order is not a final ruling on the merits of the case, but it allows the student to avoid being singled out as his legal challenge continues through the appeals process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its decades-long ban on firefighters wearing protective masks and will now issue N95 respirators to crews battling wildfires. For years, the agency argued that masks posed a risk of heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other fire-prone nations and recommendations from health agencies. The policy change follows reports detailing the health risks faced by firefighters from smoke inhalation, including increased rates of cancer and organ damage. This move is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of these dangers and comes as lawmakers are pushing for greater safety legislation for wildland firefighters.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest person after a significant surge in Oracle's stock price. Ellison's net worth jumped to $393 billion on Wednesday morning, eclipsing Musk's $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock rally was driven by Oracle's optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, which have seen a surge in demand. However, by the end of the trading day, Oracle's shares had retreated slightly, allowing Musk to reclaim the top spot he had held for nearly a year.</p>
