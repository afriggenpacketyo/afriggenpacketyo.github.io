          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves on Tuesday, less than a week after its suspension. The company stated the initial decision to halt production was to avoid inflaming national tensions following Kimmel's comments on the assassination of Charlie Kirk. After discussions with Kimmel, the show will resume. The suspension had drawn widespread criticism, prompting hundreds of entertainers and the ACLU to sign an open letter condemning the move as a threat to free speech and constitutional values.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a plan to prevent a ban on TikTok by moving its U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture. Under the proposed structure, the company would have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software giant Oracle managing security from top to bottom, including oversight of the app's powerful algorithm. While the administration expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. The plan aims to address national security concerns about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, while allowing its 170 million U.S. users to continue using the platform.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow against their home equity are weighing the costs of a home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a $50,000 HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis than a fixed-rate home equity loan for both 10- and 15-year terms. However, the variable interest rate of a HELOC means its cost could rise in the future, whereas a home equity loan provides the stability of a fixed payment. Homeowners must carefully consider their budget and risk tolerance when choosing between these two borrowing options. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated his withdrawal was not an indictment of local journalists but a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over freedom of the press.
