        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Jofra Archer made an electrifying return to Test cricket after more than four years away due to injury, taking a key wicket with just his third ball against India at Lord's. The second day of the third Test saw fluctuating fortunes, with India closing on 145-3 in response to England's first-innings total of 387. Earlier, Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional bowling (5-74) had ripped through England's middle order, despite a century from Joe Root. The match remains finely balanced, with Archer's emotional comeback and crucial wickets keeping England competitive in the pivotal contest.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, marking the first major film release under the new DC Studios leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran, has started strong at the box office. The film grossed an impressive $22.5 million in Thursday night previews, the best ever for a Superman movie and the third-best for any DC film. Projections indicate an opening weekend of $130 million to $140 million, signaling a potentially successful launch for the revitalized DC cinematic universe. With an 83% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film is being seen as a hopeful and thematically different direction from the previous, more brooding era of DC movies.</p>

          <h2>Four Debt Relief Options Available for Individuals with Low Incomes</h2>

          <p>For individuals with low incomes, managing debt from credit cards or medical bills can be overwhelming, but several relief options are available to help regain financial control. This article outlines four key strategies, including nonprofit credit counseling, which can help create a structured debt management plan with potentially lower interest rates. Another option is debt forgiveness, or settlement, where a lump-sum payment is negotiated to clear a reduced portion of the total debt. Additionally, some creditors offer temporary hardship programs, and for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy may provide a legal path to resolution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:09:17 EDT</div>

          <p>A new pilot program in England will allow GP surgeries to offer services like career coaching and exercise classes to help patients on sick leave return to the workforce more quickly. The initiative aims to reduce the number of "fit notes" that declare people unfit for work by providing proactive support and creating a plan for their return. With £1.5 million in funding across 15 regions, the program will hire occupational therapists and coaches to assist patients. The government hopes to shift the focus from what patients cannot do to how they can be supported, addressing the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, a Member of Parliament, has been cleared by the UK's parliamentary standards commissioner following a brief investigation into the registration of donations. The inquiry was opened to determine if Lowe had failed to properly declare funds raised through a crowdfunder for his independent inquiry into sexual assault gangs within the required 28-day period. Lowe provided evidence showing that the deadline had not yet passed and that all rules were being followed correctly. The commissioner concluded the complaint was not upheld, with Lowe describing the initial complaint as a "malicious attempt" to undermine his work.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, according to a recent SEC filing. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows him to sell up to six million shares through the end of the year. The sale comes as Nvidia's stock continues its remarkable ascent, with the company recently becoming the first to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization. Huang's personal net worth has also surged, placing him in close competition with Warren Buffett as one of the world's wealthiest individuals, fueled by the ongoing AI boom.

          <h2>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:26:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) continue to offer a compelling alternative for savers. The primary advantage is their significantly higher interest rates, which can still be found above 4.30% APY, allowing money to grow much faster. However, a key consideration is that these high rates are variable and may fall if the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate later this year. While HYSAs offer excellent flexibility for accessing funds, the best rates are typically found at online-only banks, which may be a drawback for those who prefer in-person banking.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high on Friday, surpassing $118,000 as institutional investment continues to pour into the asset. The rally was fueled by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs for the year, totaling $1.18 billion on Thursday. This surge comes amid a broader market expectation of a more dovish Federal Reserve and speculation about fiscal policy, which can be positive catalysts for the cryptocurrency. The recent price action has triggered over $650 million in short liquidations in the past 24 hours, further accelerating the upward momentum for the world's largest digital asset.

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, developed by the startup Cognition, in a significant milestone for artificial intelligence on Wall Street. The bank plans to augment its 12,000 human developers with the AI agent, which can independently handle complex, multi-step coding tasks with minimal human supervision. Marco Argenti, Goldman's tech chief, stated that Devin will initially be used for tasks like updating internal code, with the potential to expand to thousands of "Devins" working alongside human employees. This move signals a shift toward a "hybrid workforce" and has the potential to dramatically boost productivity.</p>
