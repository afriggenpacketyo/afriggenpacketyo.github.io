          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50% at a U.S. Steel factory outside Pittsburgh. This move aims to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on other countries. The announcement comes amid ongoing legal battles over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs. Trump's remarks were made during a rally celebrating a "partnership" deal between US Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel. (not investment advice)</p>

The target asteroid, 2016 HO3, also known as 469219 Kamo ªoalewa, was chosen for its relatively stable orbit and may offer insights into Earth's formation.

A spokesperson for the Rugby Football League said their players have been "poorly treated" by the honors system. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, has added his voice, telling BBC News the lack of rugby league knighthoods "cannot be right" when other sports, including rugby union, have had such honors "quite regularly".

          <p>Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore recounted the tension of their troubled Boeing Starliner test flight, during which failing thrusters left them unable to dock with the International Space Station (ISS). Docking was essential, and if they couldn't dock, they didn't know if they could make it back home again.

The pair's saga began in June 2024.</p>
