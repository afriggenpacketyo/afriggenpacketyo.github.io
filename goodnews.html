          <p>SpaceX has once again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, first due to an oxygen leak and then an electrically charged anvil cloud, marking the second consecutive scrub. This crucial mission aims to demonstrate fixes and upgrades following several catastrophic failures earlier this year, with a successful launch being essential for future ambitious plans. These include autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a key requirement for NASA's moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual flights to Mars. Despite Elon Musk acknowledging "thousands of engineering challenges," particularly with cryogenic propellant transfer, the company's rapid iteration approach offers hope, though some experts doubt the 2027 moon landing timeline.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is currently moving over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to continue weakening, posing no threat to land as it dissipates. Located approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the storm is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by Wednesday. Fernand is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, forming shortly after Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 intensity. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously forecast an above-normal season, anticipating 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine potentially developing into hurricanes.</p>

The drawn numbers were 16, 19, 34, 37, and 64, with a Powerball of 22. A fortunate single jackpot winner faces the choice of accepting a lump sum payment, estimated at $338.6 million before taxes, or an annuity option consisting of one immediate payment followed by 29 annually increasing payments. The jackpot had been growing since May 31, and the odds of securing the top prize are reported as 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in China have conducted a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the procedure's feasibility. The genetically modified pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours without infection or rejection. This advancement in xenotransplantation, the transfer of organs across species, is crucial given the global organ shortage. While heart and kidney xenotransplants have seen progress, lungs present unique challenges due to their complexity and direct contact with external air, increasing infection risk. This success highlights strides in genetic modification and immunosuppressive strategies but also points to further challenges for clinical application.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Singapore have significantly advanced the production of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, envisioning their potential deployment in disaster search missions. A recent article in Nature Communications details the team's progress, including improved control that increases the robotic cockroach's turning ability from 70 to over 80 degrees, verified through rigorous experiments. This achievement is praised as a meaningful development in insect-computer hybrid robots, poised to reduce both mass production time and cost for various practical applications. The technology opens new possibilities for navigating hazardous or confined spaces, offering a novel approach to locating survivors and assessing damage in disaster-stricken areas.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that Utah's Republican-controlled legislature must redraw the state's congressional boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections, finding the current map unlawful. The 2021 map divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold, among four districts, all of which subsequently elected Republicans. The court determined that the legislature circumvented a voter-established independent commission designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. This ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House and necessitates a rapid redrawing process, though promised appeals by Republican lawmakers could delay the implementation of new maps.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have traded quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. The Raiders, in urgent need of a backup after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, acquired Pickett for his 25 starts and experience. Pickett, who previously played for the Steelers and Eagles, had been competing for a backup role in Cleveland but was hampered by a hamstring injury. His departure leaves the Browns' backup quarterback position open, with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders now vying for the spot behind starter Joe Flacco, as the team finalizes its roster.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has implemented new restrictions, banning cordless curling irons and hair straighteners powered by lithium-ion batteries or gas/butane fuel from checked luggage. These devices are now only permitted in carry-on bags, with the crucial requirement that a safety cover must be securely fitted over the heating element. The rationale behind this policy is the combustible nature of these power sources; lithium-ion batteries, for instance, can overheat and cause smoke or fire, which would be extremely difficult to contain in the cargo area. This measure ensures that any potential incidents can be immediately addressed by passengers or flight attendants in the aircraft cabin.</p>

The company's chairman, Yang Rui, attributed this success to leveraging the "tremendous waves" of artificial intelligence and strategic overseas expansion, particularly into Southeast Asia and the Middle East. This robust performance is indicative of the booming electric vehicle market and the escalating demand for advanced battery technologies, setting a strong foundation for Shuangdeng's global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to U.S. schools, reversing an abrupt freeze following a multi-state lawsuit. The funds, which support after-school programs, teacher training, and English-learners, were initially withheld without clear explanation, though the White House cited alleged misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda." California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the lawsuit, criticized the administration for illegally impounding congressionally-allocated funds, causing uncertainty for programs serving 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families. The restoration of funds brings relief to communities reliant on these vital educational services.</p>

          <p>A doctor and BBC presenter, Dr. Xand van Tulleken, suggests that traditional advice to "sit up straight" is outdated and potentially harmful for back health. Instead, he proposes three dynamic rules: constant movement, building strength, and changing one's mindset. The article emphasizes that posture is dynamic, not static, advocating for regular breaks and varied positions rather than rigid stillness. It also highlights the importance of core and back strength through simple exercises like pilates or yoga, and acknowledges the psychological impact of stress on back pain, urging a holistic approach to well-being.</p>
