          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to ABC's broadcast schedule this Tuesday, reversing a suspension issued last week. The initial decision to pull the show followed pressure from broadcast station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair after Kimmel linked the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. After several days of discussions with the host, Disney executives decided to bring the show back, with Kimmel expected to address the controversy on his first episode. The incident has sparked a broader debate about free speech, political pressure on media, and the role of the FCC.</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its 2025 class of astronaut candidates, consisting of ten individuals selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group, which includes six women and four men, features a diverse range of professionals such as pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will undergo two years of intensive training for potential future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and eventually Mars. The announcement was made amidst budget uncertainties and challenges for NASA's Artemis program, though officials expressed confidence in winning the new space race against China.</p>

          <p>ABC has reinstated host Jimmy Kimmel, with his late-night show set to return to air after being suspended indefinitely last week. The network stated the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense situation following Kimmel's comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The suspension itself drew significant reaction, with the FCC Chair threatening regulatory action and major affiliate owners pulling the show. In response, many of Kimmel's peers, including Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, defended him, framing the incident as a symptom of growing censorship and media suppression under the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient presents with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months. Her family hopes the guidance will prevent similar tragedies by encouraging doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or make specialist referrals sooner. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports the rule as a best practice to catch serious illnesses earlier.</p>

          <p>China has begun drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint that will dictate the nation's economic and policy priorities from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning strategy is considered a key political advantage by President Xi Jinping, especially in a time of increasing global turbulence. The upcoming plan is crucial for Beijing's ambitious goal of achieving the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions in October, experts suggest that the new plan will need to be flexible, prioritizing qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to navigate domestic and international challenges effectively.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a crucial tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning Instagram posts made by a former student, leading to a temporary lockdown of two schools while the individual was located and weapons were recovered. The tip line was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization dedicated to preventing gun violence, which reports that this incident marks the 19th credible school attack averted by the system since 2018. Officials praised the student who submitted the tip for their bravery and swift action.</p>

          <p>Disney's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" prompted widespread backlash, culminating in an open letter signed by hundreds of entertainers, including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Pedro Pascal, in collaboration with the ACLU. The letter condemned the move as a threat to free speech, arguing that voices should not be silenced by those in power. The suspension occurred after the FCC chair, an appointee of President Trump, criticized Kimmel's monologue about the assassination of Charlie Kirk and encouraged affiliate stations to preempt the program. Disney later reversed its decision, announcing the show would return on Tuesday.</p>
