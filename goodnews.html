          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued an emergency temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The ruling came after lawyers raised alarms about a hurried plan to remove hundreds of minors without due process, with some children already on planes preparing for takeoff. The judge justified the extraordinary 14-day order by noting the government's plan was executed during the "wee hours" of a holiday weekend. The administration argued it was repatriating children at their families' request, a claim disputed by the children's legal advocates who cited U.S. law protecting minors from speedy deportations.</p>

The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm currently poses no immediate threat to land and has not issued any coastal watches or warnings. Kiko is the 11th named storm of the season in the region and is moving westward with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasters expect the storm to continue strengthening over the next few days, and it is predicted to reach hurricane status by Tuesday, with winds exceeding 74 mph.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he recently had surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, from the side of his face. He shared photos of a large bandage and post-surgical stitch marks, using the announcement to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Ramsay expressed his gratitude to the medical team for their prompt action and maintained his characteristic humor, joking that the procedure was not a facelift. This is not the first time he has used a personal health scare to promote public safety, having previously advocated for wearing helmets after a serious bicycle accident.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, achieved his second recorded hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The impressive shot occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass, where he aced the 177-yard hole. This follows his first ace, which he made just last December while playing alongside his father at the PNC Championship. Charlie is steadily building his own legacy in the sport, though he still has a way to go to catch his father, who has a career total of 10 recorded holes-in-one.</p>

          <p>Astera Labs, a company specializing in connectivity solutions for AI data centers, has become one of 2025's most prominent AI infrastructure stocks. The company recently reported quarterly revenue of $191.9 million, a 150% year-over-year increase, and raised its future guidance, significantly beating Wall Street estimates. This strong performance has driven its stock up nearly 38% year-to-date, with analysts from major firms like Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley raising their price targets. The company's focus on solving data bottlenecks for AI systems distinguishes it from broader chipmakers, positioning it as a key player in the AI hardware ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed that Europe is formulating "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of a post-conflict security guarantee. In an interview with the Financial Times, she stated that President Trump has reassured European leaders of an American presence to backstop the arrangement. The proposed deployment could involve tens of thousands of European-led troops supported by U.S. intelligence and command systems. High-level discussions on the matter are expected to continue among European leaders, signaling a significant step in planning for Ukraine's long-term security after the war.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to provide the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced frigates to operate jointly in the North Atlantic. The agreement was hailed as a victory for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This marks the fortieth consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner since it was last claimed on May 31. While the grand prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including four valuable tickets sold in Massachusetts. One ticket sold in Worcester won $1 million by matching the first five numbers, and three other tickets across the state each won $50,000. The next drawing for the massive jackpot is scheduled for Monday night.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union foreign ministers convened for informal talks to brainstorm future strategies for supporting Ukraine, exploring options beyond current measures. Among the ideas discussed were secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious issue of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction, a move that faces legal and financial hurdles. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops directly onto Ukrainian territory in the event of a ceasefire, reflecting a long-term strategic commitment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a non-profit organization called The Bay Foundation has led an effort to combat the 80% decline in the region's kelp forests. Divers manually smashed nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins, whose populations had exploded and created barren underwater landscapes. This intervention has cleared over 80 acres of reef, allowing the fast-growing giant kelp to return and restore critical habitat for hundreds of marine species.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at an incident-filled Dutch Grand Prix, extending his championship lead. The race saw a dramatic turn of events for his teammate, Lando Norris, who was running in a comfortable second place before an oil leak forced him to retire with just seven laps remaining. The retirement is a significant blow to Norris's title hopes, widening the points gap to Piastri. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar claimed a remarkable first-ever podium finish for the Racing Bulls team, capitalizing on the late-race chaos.</p>
