          <p>China is using its dominance in rare earth elements, essential for modern technologies, as leverage in trade talks with the United States. These elements are vital for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical equipment, and military applications. Recent high-level trade talks in London resulted in an agreement "in principle to a framework," a significant shift from the unsuccessful attempts at moral persuasion during the first term of President Donald Trump. This leverage highlights China's prominent position in the global industrial supply chain. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced an investigation into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires. The inquiry will focus on how State Farm and other insurers have managed smoke damage claims, citing concerns such as frequent adjuster reassignments and inconsistent claim management. While the investigation could lead to requiring State Farm to pay out previously denied claims, it will not prevent the recent 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers. The Department of Insurance has already recovered around $40 million for Eaton and Palisades fire survivors. </p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit, with Trump stating that Britain would be protected from future tariffs because he likes them. The deal covers aerospace and the auto sector, with the UK aerospace sector facing no tariffs and the auto industry having 10% tariffs, down from 25%. The steel industry still faces 25% tariffs, though the leaders pledged to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. Trump also expressed concerns about the Chinese owners of British Steel.

The proposal exempts the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The goal is to ensure accountability and transparency. </p>
