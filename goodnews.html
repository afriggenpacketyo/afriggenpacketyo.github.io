          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, Tower 208, was dismantled and removed for testing to determine its potential role in the Eaton fire. The tower, unused for over 50 years, is suspected of becoming reenergized and sparking the deadly fire on January 7. The investigation focuses on a rare phenomenon known as induction, with the tower now at a warehouse in Irwindale for examination by fire investigators and experts hired by plaintiffs suing Edison. The company also disclosed unusual electrical activity on its equipment around the fire's start time.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John G.

He emphasized that impeachment is not an appropriate response to judicial decisions and that the judiciary's role is to check the excesses of Congress or the executive. His remarks followed similar comments by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who criticized attacks on judges and an environment of harassment. The statement comes amid intense pressure on the justices as they navigate emergency applications arising from court challenges to Trump administration policies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares climbed following the Trump administration's plan to rescind the 'AI diffusion rule,' which would have restricted exports of advanced AI chips. The Commerce Department stated the rule was overly complex and would stifle American innovation, intending to replace it with a simpler rule. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD opposed the restrictions, with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang expressing concern about being locked out of the Chinese AI market. AMD CEO Lisa Su advocated for balancing national security with boosting the American chip industry.</p>
