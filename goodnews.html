          <p>Donald Trump expressed his gratitude after Palm Beach County, Florida, unanimously approved a resolution to rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The ceremonial renaming covers the roadway from Palm Beach International Airport to his Mar-a-Lago resort. The change was directed by legislation signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, which also honors three fallen sheriff's office deputies with a separate renaming on another section of the road. The new signs are expected to be installed later this year, though postal addresses will not change.</p>

          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," draws inspiration from her own experiences moving to London and navigating the differences between American and British culture. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, follows a New York workaholic who relocates across the Atlantic, offering a modern take on the romantic comedy genre. Produced by the company behind "Notting Hill" and "Love Actually," the series features a host of celebrity cameos, including Stephen Fry, Emily Ratajkowski, and Jennifer Saunders. Dunham notes that the show explores the confounding, often humorous challenges of adapting to a new country, even one that shares the same language.</p>

          <p>China has completed an 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively trapping the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project is a key part of the country's long-term "Green Great Wall" initiative aimed at halting the spread of desertification, a significant environmental challenge. Engineers utilized a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then planted with drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This strategy creates a robust ecological barrier to prevent sandstorms and protect agricultural lands, marking a significant milestone in the nation's environmental protection efforts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development and foreign aid initiatives under an "America first" policy, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill the resulting gap. The piece contrasts the dismantling of U.S. aid institutions with China's increasing role in global development, exemplified by the launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong. The author suggests that with the center of global cooperation shifting eastward, Hong Kong, as China's most cosmopolitan city, can become a new prominent hub for providing global public goods and fostering international partnerships, particularly with the Global South.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention after advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.
