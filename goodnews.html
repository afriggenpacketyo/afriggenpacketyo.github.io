          <p>Home Depot is continuing its strategic push to capture more professional contractor business by acquiring GMS, a major distributor of building materials like drywall and steel studs. The $5.5 billion deal follows Home Depot's recent large acquisition of SRS Distribution and will further expand its network for servicing professional customers. The move comes as the company's do-it-yourself segment has slowed with the housing market. While strategically sound, the acquisition has raised some concerns about delaying the restart of the company's stock buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>
