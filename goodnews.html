        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being implemented in buildings to reduce energy consumption and costs. The system freezes water during nighttime hours when electricity rates are lower, storing the ice to cool buildings during peak daytime hours. This process can cut cooling costs by up to 40% and reduce strain on the power grid during peak demand. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials that require less energy to freeze, potentially expanding the applicability of energy storage systems. Rising electricity bills are expected this summer, making energy storage solutions increasingly important.</p>
