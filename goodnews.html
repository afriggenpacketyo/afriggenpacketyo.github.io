          <p>President Trump is hosting a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, marking the capital's first major military parade in over three decades. The U.S. has held military parades throughout history, typically to celebrate the end of a war or the return of military personnel. The last major military display was in 1991 to mark the end of the Gulf War. Presidential inaugural parades often include some military personnel, but parades with military equipment became less common after the 1960s.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, indicating increased optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. The resurgence of shopper attitudes ended six months of worsening sentiment, with improvements reflected across all demographics. Year-ahead inflation expectations dropped sharply from 6.6% to 5.1%. In recent weeks, Trump has dialed back some of his steepest tariffs, easing the costs imposed upon importers, which has been a key driver of improving attitudes.</p>
