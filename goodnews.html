        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against President Trump's proclamation seeking to bar Harvard University's international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury". Harvard had sued to block the proclamation, arguing it violates the First Amendment and is retaliatory. The judge previously blocked a similar Trump administration plan to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students, deeming both actions unlawful and retaliatory for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights. Optimism is somewhat tempered due to the ongoing legal battles and the potential impact on international students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering items with fewer ingredients, driven by growing concern about ultra-processed foods. Consumers, particularly those with allergies, are seeking simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. Some brands are reformulating products and using new technologies to reduce the number of ingredients. However, some nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients in the pursuit of fewer ingredients, noting that processed foods remain essential for feeding a growing population.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have tested core components of quantum communication technology in a space flight, aiming to build a secure, encryption-free communication network. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a rocket to test their robustness against space travel conditions. This test is a key step toward creating an integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is considered a highly secure alternative to quantum key distribution, sending messages directly through a quantum channel without encryption keys.</p>

The review also covers 'Dangerous Animals,' a thriller about a psychopathic tour guide, and 'The Ritual,' a horror film starring Al Pacino, which receives a less favorable assessment due to its weak plot and overuse of jump scares.</p>

While sufficient supplies were eventually obtained, primarily from the US, they were initially limited to military use.</p>
