          <p>The CNBC Investing Club, led by Jim Cramer, is increasing its holdings in Cisco Systems and Honeywell, viewing recent stock dips as buying opportunities. The club purchased more Cisco shares following a ratings downgrade by Evercore ISI, arguing the market undervalues the company's AI potential and shift to subscription revenue. It also added to its Honeywell position after a stock drop, citing that headwinds in the aerospace and energy sectors are temporary and the company's long-term transformation is strong.

          <p>A year into his tenure, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is credited with stabilizing the aerospace giant after a period of significant turmoil, with company shares up over 30% this year. Despite challenges like the January 2024 door-plug incident, Ortberg has overseen increased production, improved airplane delivery rates, and a cultural shift that has earned praise from airline customers like Ryanair. While the company still faces FAA production caps and labor issues, analysts are optimistic about its path to profitability.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire following five days of their deadliest border conflict in over a decade. The agreement was mediated in Malaysia amid growing international pressure to end the fighting, which involved heavy weaponry and displaced thousands of civilians. While the truce is a critical first step, the situation remains volatile, with thousands of evacuees in temporary shelters hoping the deal brings a lasting end to the violence.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a significant trade agreement following a meeting at Trump's golf resort in Scotland. The deal sets a 15% tariff rate for most EU imports into the U.S., avoiding a threatened 30% blanket tariff, while the EU will reportedly open its markets to U.S. goods at a zero tariff. Hailed by Trump as "the biggest deal ever made," the agreement aims to bring stability and predictability to the $2 trillion annual trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. trade deals with Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which lower tariffs for them in exchange for near-zero tariffs on U.S. goods, are raising questions about the impact on the European Union. While some EU exports could be displaced by American products, analysts believe the deals may pressure Southeast Asian nations to offer similar low-tariff terms to Europe. The agreements could strengthen the EU's negotiating position in its own free trade talks with ASEAN countries, potentially intensifying competition in sectors like agriculture.

It explains that this trait can stem from a combination of genetic predisposition and life experiences, such as a history of rejection. This heightened sensitivity is linked to a fundamental human need to feel valued in relationships. The article suggests coping strategies, such as questioning worst-case assumptions and being more discerning about whose opinions truly matter, to manage these intense emotional reactions.</p>
