        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach asserts that the state's age-verification law for pornographic websites is effectively protecting children, citing lawsuits filed by a minor and their mother against sites like Chaturbate. The lawsuits allege that these sites failed to adequately prevent the minor's access to harmful content, despite parental efforts to restrict it. NCOSE's General Counsel Benjamin Bull emphasizes the need for online platforms to install age verification to prevent children from accessing pornography. Multi Media LLC, Chaturbate's parent company, insists the site is fully compliant with Kansas law, calling the lawsuit against it "completely baseless". The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto, now with the New York Mets after signing a 15-year, $765 million contract, was met with resounding boos upon his return to Yankee Stadium.
