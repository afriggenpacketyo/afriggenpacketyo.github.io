        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets ended Thursday with mixed results, influenced by the Bank of Korea's decision to maintain its policy rate at 2.5% for a second consecutive meeting, a move widely anticipated by economists. While South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, India's Nifty 50 declined as new U.S. tariffs, increasing duties to 50% on certain exports, came into effect. This article also highlights significant corporate news, such as Australian rare earths producer Lynas' A$750 million share sale and Qantas' record-high shares driven by strong earnings. The broader context includes overnight gains in U.S. markets, despite Nvidia's shares slipping slightly post-earnings due to data center revenue falling short of estimates and concerns over China sales.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers Fantasy Premier League (FPL) tips for gameweek three, suggesting a "Free Hit" team built within a £100m budget. Key recommendations include Chelsea's Robert Sanchez as a solid goalkeeper pick and Marc Cucurella as a defensive must-have for his attacking contributions. Mohamed Salah is highlighted as the captain choice despite a tough fixture against Arsenal, given Liverpool's aggressive attacking approach. Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes is also recommended for midfield, with Harvey Barnes and Dango Ouattara as potential differential picks. Upfront, Chris Wood, Joao Pedro, and Jean-Philippe Mateta are selected for their goal-scoring potential against favorable matchups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unique and widely acclaimed photograph of seventh-seed Jasmine Paolini at the US Open has been hailed as potentially "the picture of the year" for its comedic timing and visual appeal. Photographer Ray Giubilo captured the image by fluke, attributing it to Paolini's slight imbalance during a forehand stroke, making the shot unreproducible. This article describes how Giubilo, a veteran tennis photographer with 37 years of experience, instantly recognized the image's quality on his camera. Paolini herself expressed admiration for the photo, directly complimenting Giubilo on court. The incident highlights the blend of patience, creative flair, impeccable technical ability, and sheer luck involved in capturing truly iconic and memorable sports moments.</p>

          <p>European markets opened higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index showing gains, driven partly by the continued resilience of the artificial intelligence boom reflected in Nvidia's strong sales growth forecast. However, Nvidia's shares experienced a slight dip after hours due to data center revenue missing estimates and concerns over China sales. This article highlights French spirits giant Pernod Ricard's 3% sales decline, impacted by weak consumer sentiment in China and U.S. tariffs. British renewable energy group Drax saw its shares fall 11% following a U.K. regulatory probe into its biomass sourcing statements and annual report compliance, adding a note of caution to the market.

          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the U.S. increased by 6.8% in July, reversing a three-month decline, following the implementation of a new UK-US tariff deal that lowered import taxes to 10% on the first 100,000 cars. This article highlights the significance of the U.S. as the largest single national market for British-built cars, particularly for premium brands like Jaguar Land Rover. Despite this positive development in exports, overall UK car manufacturing continues to struggle, with output down 11.7% year-to-date, attributed to factors like higher labor costs, increased international competition, and Brexit. Experts emphasize the need for continued investment in new technologies amid a turbulent automotive landscape.</p>

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% surge in second-quarter revenue to $46.7 billion, driven by strong demand from tech giants expanding their AI capabilities, despite navigating US-China trade tensions. This article highlights CEO Jensen Huang's statement that the "AI race is now on," with significant spending from major tech firms. However, Nvidia's shares dipped in after-hours trading as data center revenue slightly missed analyst expectations and concerns arose over the future of its China sales, especially after the US government began reviewing licenses for H20 chips. The company is also lobbying for approval to sell its Blackwell chips to China, underscoring its exposure to geopolitical factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widespread emotional reaction to Taylor Swift's engagement news, with fans expressing joy and tears online, has brought the concept of "parasocial relationships" into focus. This article explains that these one-sided friendships, where individuals feel intimately connected to celebrities who don't know them, are fueled by the extensive sharing of private lives on social media. Psychologists note that while such relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, especially online, they cannot replace reciprocal real-life friendships. Experts compare them to fast food, tasting good but lacking nutritional content for genuine human connection, as celebrities do not reciprocate individual fan affection.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to combat invasive Burmese pythons in the Florida Everglades, robot rabbits that mimic real marsh rabbits in appearance, movement, and smell are being deployed as lures. This article explains that the robots, retrofitted with heat emitters and solar power, are placed in monitored pens to detect pythons, which have decimated native mammal populations. The initiative, a collaboration between the South Florida Water Management District and University of Florida researchers, aims to improve python detection, a significant challenge due to their camouflage. While the project is in its early stages, initial results offer optimism for more effective python removal efforts.</p>
