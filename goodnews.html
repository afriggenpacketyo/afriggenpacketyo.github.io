          <p>A Chinese student at Harvard, Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, delivered a graduation speech emphasizing shared humanity and global unity, which has gained significant attention. This comes as the Trump administration intensifies its scrutiny of Chinese students in the U.S., threatening to revoke visas for those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. Jiang's speech coincided with a federal judge blocking a Department of Homeland Security order that aimed to restrict international student enrollment at Harvard, which the White House accuses of having ties to the Chinese Communist Party, further highlighting the tensions between the U.S. and China regarding education and national security. The speech underscores the importance of international collaboration and understanding amidst growing geopolitical tensions. The optimism score of this article is 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These nanoparticles convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, although the resulting images are somewhat blurred, and additional lenses are required to partially compensate for this effect. While not as powerful as traditional night vision goggles, the lenses could have applications in surgery, encryption, and counterfeit protection, and the lenses work even better with closed eyes.

          <p>Tommy Paul defeated Alexei Popyrin in straight sets to advance to the quarter-finals of the French Open. Popyrin, the Australian men‚Äôs No 2, was unable to capitalize on an early break in the first game, ultimately succumbing to Paul's consistent play. Paul saved all ten break points he faced and capitalized on Popyrin's unforced errors, making him the first American man in the quarter-finals since 2003. Paul expressed relief at the swift victory after battling through two consecutive five-set matches, and he will face either Ben Shelton or Carlos Alcaraz in the next round.

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry over nine years to fund security-related technology research. This funding has become an important resource for researchers amid declining operational subsidies to national universities and a decreasing student population. The ministry's program, which began in fiscal year 2015, initially targeted universities, public research institutes, and private companies with a budget of 300 million yen, and in fiscal year 2017, it expanded to include large-scale research projects, increasing the total allocation to 11 billion yen. Some universities are utilizing the funds for advanced projects, such as developing sheets that absorb harmful gases and AI systems to detect cyberattacks.

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order that cut federal funding to what Donald Trump deemed "biased media." The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech by targeting NPR for its news coverage, and experts believe NPR has a strong case, citing Trump's statements about NPR and PBS being "leftwing propaganda." This legal action marks a significant pushback against Trump's ongoing attacks on media organizations he perceives as reporting negatively on him, and the lawsuit aims to have the order permanently blocked and declared unconstitutional.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that to fight back against Trump's policies, we must look to poor people‚Äôs movements for inspiration, highlighting the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO). The NWRO, led by poor Black women, staged mass marches and demonstrations, challenging racist policies and advocating for a "guaranteed adequate income." The "Johnnie Tillmon model" emphasizes uniting the poor across differences, building visionary projects of survival, and operating as an independent force in public life. The article suggests that by harnessing the ingenuity and brilliance within poor communities, a transformational power can be unleashed to challenge the status quo and create lasting change.
