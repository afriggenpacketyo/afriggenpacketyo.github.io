          <h2>Nintendo Anticipates Strong Switch 2 Sales Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking its first sales forecast since announcing the Switch's successor, due in June. The company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 24.7% year-on-year, with profits plunging nearly 50% as consumers await the new console. Nintendo delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to potential tariffs on Vietnamese-manufactured consoles, which could significantly impact profits if imposed. President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that U.S. tariffs could decrease demand if prices are adjusted, potentially affecting profit by tens of billions of yen.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has achieved a significant trade agreement with the U.S., marking the first deal of its kind since President Donald Trump initiated global tariffs. This accomplishment follows a recent free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to boost bilateral trade by ¬£25.5 billion and increase UK GDP by ¬£4.8 billion. The agreement provides a political boost for Starmer, who faced pressure after recent local election results, and underscores his warm relationship with President Trump. The deal is expected to reduce tariffs on specific goods, including British steel and cars, while addressing U.S. interests in pharmaceuticals and technology.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the cause of a fire that shut down Heathrow Airport, affecting hundreds of thousands of journeys, "remains unknown." The airport was closed on March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence of suspicious activity. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) is conducting an investigation, with a final report due by the end of June, to determine the cause and prevent future incidents. Heathrow said it welcomed the interim findings and hoped the final report would provide answers.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery writer who passed away in 1976, has been digitally resurrected to teach an online writing course through BBC Maestro. Using a "digital prosthetic" created with artificial intelligence and a script based on her writings and archival interviews, a real actor portrays Christie. While her family approved the project with the stipulation that it use her own words, some ethicists raise concerns about the posthumous use of her likeness. The debate centers on whether such representations, even with consent from the estate, constitute a deepfake and potentially misrepresent the author's views.</p>

          <p>Britain is reportedly set to sign a trade deal with the U.S., making it the first country to do so after the world's largest economy announced stiff "reciprocal" tariffs against friends and foes alike in April. It was uncertain if both sides will sign a finalized deal or a framework for an agreement that they would continue negotiating in the coming months, NYT said. Britain, which runs a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher "reciprocal" tariffs when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy.</p>

The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding. A new study suggests tags that monitor curfews cut reoffending by 20%.</p>

The sale of the collection - described as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era - had drawn criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders. India had said it offended the global Buddhist community. Sotheby's said the suspension would allow for discussions between the parties. A British official named William Claxton Pepp√© unearthed the relics in northern India nearly 130 years ago, alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha himself.</p>
