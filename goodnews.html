          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to strengthen its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This initiative aims to address deficiencies in weapons and munitions production highlighted by the war in Ukraine, creating approximately 1,800 new jobs and supporting the production of 7,000 long-range weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that a strong defense industry is vital for national security and economic growth, aligning with plans to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. The government aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity, reducing reliance on foreign sources and boosting the UK's industrial base.

          <p>The UK ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into effect, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. While shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which are considered a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. Ministers anticipate a significant impact, though health experts advocate for further regulation to address youth vaping comprehensively. Vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking but it has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known, according to the NHS. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
