          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to lead U.S. Central Command, overseeing military operations in the Middle East and North Africa, and Lt. Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command. Cooper, who played a key role in strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, will replace Gen. Michael Kurilla, while Anderson will succeed Gen. Michael Langley. These appointments come as Trump aims to restore stability in the Middle East, a goal that has faced challenges amid ongoing conflicts and tensions with Iran. Cooper's experience includes overseeing strikes against Houthi targets and contributing to the construction of a humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza.</p>

          <p>A researcher claims that the fungus labeled a "potential agroterrorism weapon" in a recent arrest is already widespread in the U.S. Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with attempting to smuggle strains of Fusarium graminearum into the country for research purposes. Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, states that the fungus is prevalent in North America and causes the common crop disease Fusarium head blight. Farmers use fungicides to mitigate the risk, and the FDA monitors for toxins produced by the fungus to prevent excessive contamination in the food supply, as epidemics caused by the fungus have resulted in billions of dollars in losses.</p>

          <p>Zoe Salda√±a revealed that she "collapsed" physically after winning her supporting actress Oscar for "Emilia P√©rez," experiencing exhaustion and losing her voice. She attributed this to her body running on adrenaline for months during awards season, leading to an immune system crash once the period ended. Salda√±a's win followed an impressive awards season, though the film itself faced criticism for its portrayal of transgender issues and depiction of Mexico. The actor defended the film's intentions, emphasizing its focus on friendship and universal struggles, and addressed negative press surrounding the cast and crew.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the deportation of the wife and children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is charged in the firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado. Judge Gordon P. Gallagher granted the request to halt deportation proceedings, citing the urgent need to protect the family's constitutional rights. The family members have not been charged in the attack, and attorneys argued that punishing them for the crimes of their relative violates the foundations of a democratic justice system. Soliman is accused of a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder for attacking a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.</p>
