          <p>World Boxing announced that it will implement mandatory gender tests for all male and female fighters in its competitions to ensure fairness and safety. The decision follows controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, whose gender was questioned after she won gold at the Paris Olympics. The new policy requires athletes over 18 to undergo a PCR genetic test to detect the SRY gene, an indicator of biological sex, and athletes seeking to compete in women's categories will undergo additional screening if initial tests show male chromosomal material. The federation has informed the Algerian Boxing Federation that Khelif must submit to a gender test before competing in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup.</p>

During a Memorial Day service, he lamented the divisiveness in American politics but highlighted the unity within the military, and he reflected on the 10th anniversary of his son Beau's death.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has come to an end, with President Trump praising Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government. While Musk initially promised to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, the initiative's savings have fallen short of that goal, with estimates ranging from $170 billion in savings to $135 billion in costs. Musk defended DOGE's work and expressed confidence that it will achieve the $1 trillion goal "over time". Despite public disagreements with Trump over domestic policy, Musk said he would continue to serve as a "friend and adviser" to the president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England secured a 108-run victory against the West Indies in a Women's ODI match, fueled by centuries from Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont. The opening stand between Jones and Beaumont was England's fifth-highest partnership in women's ODI history and their highest against the West Indies. England's clear plan was to adjust to the slow bowling attack, preserve wickets, and accelerate in the final overs, setting a strong platform for Sciver-Brunt and Lamb to further increase the score. West Indies' batting line-up heavily relies on their captain, making the total feel far beyond their reach.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, a week after suggesting he had approved a merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are eager for clarity on the deal, which Trump described as a "partnership" where U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and Nippon would invest $14 billion. Senator Dave McCormick said the U.S. government will have a "golden share" allowing it to decide on a number of board seats and ensure production levels aren't cut, constituting a national security agreement. The original offer from Nippon was initially blocked by President Joe Biden on national security grounds.</p>

The partnership revolves around the U.S. government's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) contract, which Microsoft handed over to Anduril, with Anduril naming its next-generation IVAS product EagleEye. This partnership could provide a stable source of sales from the U.S. government for Reality Labs, improving operating losses and diversifying Meta's revenue stream. Anduril plans to leverage Meta's investments in consumer-grade hardware and software to build out the final product, with prototypes expected to be delivered to the Army this year.</p>

Some analysts suggest Dimon's cautiousness is a strategy to keep his management team focused on future risks and prevent complacency. While Dimon's warnings haven't always come to fruition, JPMorgan's preparedness for various economic scenarios has contributed to its success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors tracking gold prices should monitor the market closely in June, as the climate is right for another price spike due to upcoming inflation readings and a Federal Reserve meeting. While the price of gold is down from a recent record high, experts predict it could rise again, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, gold prices typically rise over time, making it a reliable hedge against inflation and a tangible asset to hold. Investors can explore cost-effective ways to invest, such as fractional gold and dollar-cost averaging, while limiting gold to 10% or less of their overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
