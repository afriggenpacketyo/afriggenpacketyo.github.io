          <p>Japan's Agriculture Minister Taku Eto resigned after making an inappropriate comment about rice amid a national rice shortage and soaring prices. Eto stated that he had "never had to buy rice" because supporters gave it to him, sparking public outrage. The article explains that rice is a staple food in Japan, and Eto's comment struck a nerve in a country where retail rice prices have doubled since last year.

          <p>The FDA has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The article highlights that vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct "randomized, placebo-controlled trials" before the FDA approves shots for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. This new regulatory framework aims to balance access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence-based decisions.</p>
