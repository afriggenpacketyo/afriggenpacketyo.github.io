        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have agreed to scale back the federal takeover of the city's police department, averting a larger legal confrontation. Under the new arrangement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, while the DEA administrator will act as a federal "designee" rather than the emergency commissioner. This resolution came after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the initial takeover order during a hearing on the city's emergency lawsuit. The agreement still allows federal authorities to direct D.C. police for specific federal purposes, such as immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property. This development follows a city law passed last year aimed at creating more accessible homeownership opportunities amid the state's housing crisis. Officials hope this new model of "starter home" will be replicated across California to help address the housing shortage. ADUs, often called granny flats or backyard cottages, have become increasingly popular, accounting for about one-fifth of the state's housing growth in the past year.</p>

Due to his declining health, Gabriel could not travel to Illinois but fulfilled his promise by conducting the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The original agreement was made as a lighthearted bet with the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, who was impressed by Gabriel's vitality. The event celebrated Gabriel's long career and his commitment to keeping his word.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two recent clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in controlled portions, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, did not cause adverse glycemic responses. In one study, participants with type 2 diabetes who replaced breakfast bread with mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and other key metabolic markers. Researchers emphasize that moderation is crucial, but the findings suggest the fruit can be part of a healthy diet for diabetics when managed correctly.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship has generated discussion for its unique depiction of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. The artwork alters an iconic image of Bryant celebrating, replacing his gold Lakers jersey with a white Dodgers basketball-style jersey. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that the choice was made to keep with the mural's theme while still honoring Bryant, a beloved L.A. sports figure and Dodgers fan. While most reactions have been positive, the creative twist has sparked a playful debate among fans about Bryant's exclusive association with the Lakers.</p>

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone physical stores and its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was sold to online retailer Asos, but now aims to reclaim its physical presence on the British High Street. The relaunch hopes to capitalize on nostalgia among millennials while also attracting a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers. Industry experts note that while there is affection for the brand, its success will depend on recapturing its "cool" factor and competing in a market now dominated by fast fashion.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Premier League title defense with a dramatic 4-2 victory against Bournemouth, but the performance revealed significant defensive vulnerabilities. New signing Hugo Ekitike was a standout, scoring one goal and assisting another, making an immediate impact at Anfield. However, the team's defensive frailties were exposed when Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo scored a fine equalizer, highlighting gaps in the midfield and on the flanks. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the win, but the chaotic match suggests head coach Arne Slot has work to do to solidify his new-look squad.</p>

          <p>The global bubble tea market is experiencing explosive growth, with three major Chinese chains recently raising over $700 million in Hong Kong IPOs. The industry, projected to be worth nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, relies heavily on a franchise model that fuels rapid expansion but also faces challenges. Market saturation in China, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control across thousands of outlets are testing the resilience of these brands. As companies like Mixue Group expand internationally, they must prove their business model is sustainable and not just a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of highly successful tech IPOs, including those for Bullish, Figma, and Circle, has signaled a strong resurgence in the market for public offerings after a nearly three-year slowdown. Investor enthusiasm is high, with several companies seeing their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, reminiscent of a bull market. This renewed confidence is encouraging a backlog of high-value startups to prepare for their own public debuts, potentially opening the floodgates for more offerings. While the market is robust, some analysts caution that the exuberant first-day pops may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, plans to sell a simple, customizable, American-made pickup truck for a significantly lower price than the current market average. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones base model, allowing owners to add features and accessories as they see fit, thereby keeping the initial manufacturing cost down. With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is betting that affordability is the key to mass EV adoption, especially as federal incentives are being reduced. However, the vehicle will face competition from other budget-friendly models. (not investment advice)</p>
