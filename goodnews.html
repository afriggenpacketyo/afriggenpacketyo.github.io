          <p>In a historic, all-female boxing event at Madison Square Garden, Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano by a majority decision, concluding their celebrated trilogy. The bout was a tactical "chess match," differing from their previous encounters, with Taylor's economical and smart boxing earning her the win on two of the three judges' scorecards. Following the fight, both athletes expressed immense mutual respect, acknowledging their roles in making boxing history. Taylor's victory solidifies her legacy in what some speculate might be her final match, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a gripping contest.</p>

          <p>A fugitive named Sedrick T. Stevenson, who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. Photos released by the Warren County Sheriff's Office show a smiling Stevenson on the plane, escorted by multiple officers under high-security measures to prevent another escape. Stevenson, who was originally wanted on firearm and drug charges, had been on the run for over a month before U.S. Marshals apprehended him in Seattle. Authorities coordinated with multiple agencies to ensure his secure return, with officials humorously noting he received "VIP service."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move in the AI talent war, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees. The deal involves Google paying $2.4 billion in licensing fees and compensation, though it is not a full acquisition of the company. Windsurf, which specializes in AI tools for writing code, will remain an independent entity. This high-profile hiring underscores the intense competition among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft to secure top AI researchers and developers, often through lucrative deals that fall short of traditional acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for selling sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the design at Milan Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, sparking a social media outcry and a formal complaint from an Indian trade chamber. In response, Prada held a meeting to discuss collaboration opportunities, a move seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities. The chamber also plans to patent the Kolhapuri chappal to protect its cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in several Southern California counties. The ruling, a victory for the ACLU and other advocacy groups, prohibits federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like their race, accent, or presence at specific locations like day laborer sites. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong stated there was a "mountain of evidence" that unconstitutional practices were occurring. The order also requires that detainees at a Los Angeles facility be given access to legal counsel, addressing key grievances in the ongoing lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward, marking a significant development in the legal battles over AI and intellectual property. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the artists' voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their work as training data will proceed. The artists allege Lovo cloned their voices without permission after hiring them for what they were told were internal or academic projects, a case their attorney calls a victory for holding big tech accountable.</p>

          <p>In response to a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies operating abroad, Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their global presence. The number of overseas offices for these firms has increased by 70 percent since 2018, as Chinese businesses increasingly prefer legal support from their compatriots. While they are successfully serving Chinese clients, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions. This expansion reflects a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry as it adapts to support the nation's growing international economic footprint and navigate a complex global landscape.</p>

          <p>Chinese aviation authorities have enacted an emergency ban on substandard portable power banks on flights, following several incidents where defective units caught fire. As of June 28, passengers are barred from carrying power banks that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. The new rule has caused confusion and led to large numbers of abandoned devices at airports. This measure follows earlier regulations implemented across Asia that already prohibited the charging of power banks during flights, as public scrutiny of manufacturers intensifies amid a government review of battery safety.</p>

          <p>With the patent for the popular weight-loss drug semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) expiring in China next year, dozens of Chinese pharmaceutical firms are developing rival medications. An estimated 60 similar drugs are currently in clinical trials, positioning China to become a major player in the rapidly growing global market for these treatments, which is projected to reach $150 billion. The influx of generic versions is expected to significantly lower prices, making these drugs more accessible to patients in China and potentially worldwide, highlighting a major shift in the global pharmaceutical landscape.

          <p>Despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement due to trade tariffs, the Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365-million terminal expansion project. The operator, International Transportation Service, plans to extend the quay and add 19 acres of new land to accommodate larger ships and increase cargo-handling capacity by 50%. Officials expressed confidence in the port's long-term growth, citing the need to prepare for bigger vessels and strengthen the U.S. supply chain. The project moves forward even as both the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles report decreased activity and job opportunities linked to current global trade instability.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted his first "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and philanthropists to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony led by an Earth Elder and focused on the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of traditional, sustainable practices. The King's long-held beliefs, once considered fringe, are now seen as increasingly mainstream. The summit aimed to draw on the wisdom of Indigenous peoples, who have become threatened guardians of the natural world, to address modern environmental crises and promote a more sustainable future.</p>
