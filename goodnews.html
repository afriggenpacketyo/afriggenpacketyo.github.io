          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has unveiled an ambitious plan to integrate artificial intelligence across its energy sector, aiming for global leadership by 2030. The strategy involves developing at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas. By 2027, the government plans to establish a comprehensive framework, launch over 10 pilot projects, and create 100 application scenarios. This initiative also includes establishing dedicated research platforms and training specialists to drive innovation and secure China's position in the future of smart energy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns about artificial intelligence causing job losses, labor economists argue that its overall impact on the workforce has been relatively small so far. Experts from the job site Indeed suggest that recent labor market turbulence is more attributable to general economic uncertainty than to AI-driven layoffs, which have been largely confined to the tech sector. Studies indicate that while some early-career roles have seen declines, there is also a growing demand for AI-related skills. The consensus is that AI is more likely to augment human labor and require retraining rather than cause widespread replacement across most industries.</p>

          <h2>Investment in Nuclear Energy Faces Significant Financial Hurdles Despite Surging Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 06:57:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy, driven by the power demands of AI and data centers, is confronting major investment challenges due to vast capital requirements and regulatory uncertainty. While tech giants are investing and projections show trillions flowing into the nuclear value chain, large-scale projects in the West have been plagued by budget overruns and long delays. Financial experts note that while banks are now more open to financing nuclear projects, the risk appetite remains low without significant government backstops. The development of smaller, more scalable modular reactors offers promise but most are not expected to be commercially viable until 2030. (not investment advice)</p>
