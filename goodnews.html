          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 15:37:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the three primary requirements for individuals looking to enroll in a debt management program to handle overwhelming unsecured debt like credit cards. To qualify, an applicant must demonstrate a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and a consistent monthly plan payment. Secondly, the individual must have a manageable amount of unsecured debt, as these programs typically have minimum and maximum limits and do not cover secured debts like mortgages. Finally, the person must be willing to commit to the program's strict rules, which often include closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel has shared a positive update on his health after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder involving excess fluid. In a recent podcast appearance, Joel stated that he feels good, despite the condition's intimidating name, and noted that his symptoms have been manageable. The 76-year-old had previously canceled his tour dates after the diagnosis, which caused issues with his balance, vision, and hearing. His update has reassured fans as a two-part HBO documentary about his life and career is currently being released.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major shift in its long-standing business model, confirming it will transition to assigned seating starting January 27, 2026. This move ends the carrier's iconic open-seating policy, where passengers chose seats upon boarding. The new system will allow customers to select specific seats, including options with extra legroom, and will be accompanied by an overhauled boarding process with eight numbered groups. This change follows the recent elimination of the "bags fly free" policy, signaling a significant strategic pivot for the airline amid growing financial pressures.</p>

A Pentagon spokesperson stated the withdrawal was possible due to a return to stability, crediting the Marines with restoring order. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a staunch critic of the deployment, called the withdrawal a "win for Los Angeles," emphasizing that troops should not be used for such domestic missions.</p>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, is sharing his top survival tips amid recent shark sightings off the U.S. coast. He advises swimmers to first and foremost stay calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract a shark's curiosity. Secondly, he recommends maintaining eye contact with the animal, as sharks prefer to ambush unseen prey. As a final resort, de Gelder suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to deter it, rather than punching. His advice aims to empower beachgoers and reduce fear through knowledge.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot was forced to take what he described as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military bomber while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the bomber appeared on a converging course unexpectedly, as the airport's control tower operates visually without radar. The B-52 was in the area for a flyover at the North Dakota State Fair, an event the flight crew was not warned about. The incident, which resulted in no injuries, is now under investigation by the FAA and the U.S. Air Force to determine the cause of the communication breakdown.</p>

His rise is seen as a sign of hope and growing political power for communities that have faced intense scrutiny and Islamophobia, particularly since 9/11. Despite facing smears from political opponents, Mamdani's success suggests that his progressive, unabashedly Muslim identity resonates with a broad segment of the electorate.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed breakdown of the maximum amounts students can borrow in federal student loans, which vary based on several key factors. The limits are determined by a student's dependency status, their year in school, and whether they are an undergraduate or graduate student. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500 annually, while a graduate student can borrow up to $20,500. The article notes that these federal limits may not cover the full cost of attendance, often creating a funding gap that students may need to fill with private loans.</p>
