          <p>The Mayo Clinic is utilizing a fecal waste biobank to research how the microbiome influences cancer patients' responses to medication. The biobank, containing over 2,000 stool samples, aims to personalize medicine by identifying which drugs patients are most likely to respond to based on their microbiome and genes. Researchers are exploring fecal transplants and other methods to manipulate the gut microbiome, potentially improving cancer treatment outcomes. This work is occurring amidst proposed budget cuts to US scientific institutions, raising concerns about the ability of private entities to fill the funding gap left by the government.</p>

          <p>China decreased its holdings of US Treasury securities in March, relinquishing its position as the second-largest foreign holder. This reduction occurred before the trade war between the US and China intensified, with China's stockpile falling to $765.4 billion. Meanwhile, Britain increased its holdings and became the second-largest foreign creditor to the US. Moody's Ratings subsequently downgraded the US government's credit rating, leading to higher yields on Treasury bonds.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work in other countries for a limited period. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia, but some politicians express concern that such a scheme could lead to unrestricted migration. The proposal aims to improve relations with the EU and provide opportunities for young people, though specific details and potential limitations are still under discussion. The summit will also address issues such as fishing rights and trade.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure and declaring it an essential health benefit. A White House report is expected to make recommendations for reducing out-of-pocket costs for I.V.F. treatment. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine has not been invited to participate in the discussions, raising concerns about the process. The administration's efforts are complicated by conflicting views within Mr. Trump's base, as some Christian conservatives oppose I.V.F. due to concerns about the disposal of embryos.</p>

          <p>President Trump's push for a comprehensive budget package, dubbed "one big, beautiful bill," draws parallels to Ronald Reagan's ambitious fiscal policies of the 1980s. Both initiatives rely on budget reconciliation to bypass Senate filibusters and enact significant changes to tax, spending, and policy directives. Reagan's program, known as Reaganomics, involved tax cuts, increased military spending, and deregulation, with the promise of stimulating economic growth. Similarly, Trump's plan aims to reshape the federal government through tax cuts and spending adjustments, echoing the ambitions and challenges of the Reagan era.</p>
