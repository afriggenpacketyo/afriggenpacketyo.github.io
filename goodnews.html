          <p>The United States and Iran are scheduled to resume high-level talks regarding Iran's nuclear program in Oman, marking the sixth round of discussions since April. The talks aim to establish a new agreement to replace the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the U.S. withdrew under the Trump administration. Despite heightened tensions in the region, the U.S. delegation plans to attend, with Iran expressing optimism that a deal can be reached to ensure the peaceful nature of its nuclear program under IAEA supervision.

While acknowledging Nvidia's technological lead, Huang warned that Huawei could meet China's AI chip demands if U.S. firms are unable to participate in the market. Beijing has been focused on bolstering domestic firms like Huawei to create its own AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. export curbs. Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei conceded that their single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation.</p>

          <p>The Ifo Institute in Munich has significantly raised its economic growth forecast for Germany in 2026, projecting a 1.5% increase in gross domestic product (GDP), almost twice the originally forecast 0.8%. The institute attributes this growth spurt to new government measures and a spending surge aimed at boosting the country's economy. The forecast for 2025 was also adjusted upward to 0.3%. However, the improved forecast is largely based on assumptions that the trade war between the European Union and US President Donald Trump would be resolved (not investment advice).</p>
