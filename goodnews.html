          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM," identifying itself as a technology company rather than a traditional bank. Chime generates revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases made using its debit and credit cards, reporting $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter, with a 32% revenue growth. The company offers various services, including free tax filing and early access to earned pay, and states that around two-thirds of its members use Chime as their primary financial relationship. However, the IPO plans were delayed due to market volatility following tariff announcements.</p>

          <p>Representative Adam Schiff, along with other Senate Democrats, has called for the Department of Defense's Inspector General to investigate the Trump administration's potential acceptance of a luxury jet from the Qatari government. The letter expresses concerns that the DOD might be used to facilitate an impermissible gift and place the burden of retrofitting the plane on U.S. taxpayers, ultimately transferring it to President Trump's library for personal use. The senators requested a comprehensive audit into potential fraud, waste, and abuse related to the transfer, along with details on the costs and timelines for retrofitting the plane to meet Air Force One standards. This request comes amid concerns about constitutional limitations on accepting foreign gifts without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>During Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, a narrative strategy emerged that seeks to reinterpret historical events related to World War II. Chinese and Russian officials emphasized the roles of China and the Soviet Union in bearing the primary burden of defeating fascism, while downplaying the contributions of the U.S., Britain, and other Allied nations. This narrative aims to position China and Russia as inheritors of the anti-fascist tradition and challenges the foundations of the post-World War II global order. The goal is to reshape the world order established after 1989, which currently operates under U.S. influence.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has announced the reinstatement of Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. This policy change means bans will expire upon death, allowing Rose and Jackson to be considered for induction as early as 2028. Rose, who agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, now have the opportunity for posthumous recognition. The Hall of Fame's board will consider the candidacies of those affected by Manfred's ruling.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reported that as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace on Monday night, despite a target of 14, due to a national shortage of air traffic controllers. This staffing shortage comes as Newark Liberty International Airport faces technological issues, worker shortages, and runway construction, leading to flight cancellations and delays. The FAA has slowed arrivals and departures to ensure safety, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that these measures are to guarantee safety, not to annoy or delay travelers. Management of flight traffic at Newark was moved to Philadelphia last summer, and the FAA is working to address the challenges.</p>

Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture aspects of reality in a non-propagandistic way, citing V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" as examples. He concludes that politically themed art succeeds not through conversion, but through unsettling viewers and readers with unexpected truths, fostering sympathy for differing perspectives.</p>

With pharmaceutical production shifting overseas, Trump's executive order aims to streamline the process for pharmaceutical companies to build new U.S. production sites. The order directs the FDA to expedite reviews, remove unnecessary requirements, and increase inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants. This initiative seeks to reduce reliance on foreign pharmaceutical imports and bolster national security by encouraging domestic production.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Op-Docs presents "M/other," a short documentary in which three women swap mothers to discuss their choice to remain child-free. The film captures candid conversations between women who have chosen not to have children and mothers who grapple with understanding that decision. In a world where women's reproductive choices are often questioned, this film seeks to provide a platform for these women to share their experiences and foster greater understanding. It explores personal and ongoing conversations about societal expectations and individual autonomy.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, the stock market has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, but investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies. Despite the administration dialing back its trade offensive and stocks rising, investors complain about the lack of clarity on the final level of tariffs. This situation leaves them in a difficult position, as they are hesitant to remain on the sidelines and miss potential gains, yet wary of the economic impact of the remaining tariffs. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of the tariffs become clearer.</p>
