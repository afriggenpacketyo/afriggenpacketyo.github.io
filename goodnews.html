          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is joining the FBI as its second-ever co-deputy director, serving alongside Dan Bongino. This appointment is part of President Trump's new focus on federal law enforcement and comes amid internal tensions at the bureau, particularly concerning the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Bailey is known for his conservative legal actions, including opposing student debt forgiveness and DEI programs, and has received praise from Republican figures like Senator Josh Hawley. His arrival follows reports of significant frustration from Bongino regarding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng has announced plans for the global launch of its affordable Mona brand, starting with Europe in 2026. This move is set to intensify competition with both Chinese rivals like BYD and established Western automakers in the increasingly crowded EV market. CEO He Xiaopeng also indicated the company is now open to acquiring other carmakers to navigate the fierce price wars in China's domestic market. The Mona brand, which debuted in China with a model priced under $17,000, represents a strategic push into more accessible vehicle segments. (not investment advice)</p>

The club has now accepted that these regulations, designed to ensure commercial deals with owner-linked companies are at fair market value, are valid and binding. This resolution follows a period of conflict where City had claimed the rules were "unlawful" after a majority of clubs voted to approve amendments to them in November 2024.

          <p>Gold is widely considered a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability, with its price influenced by a variety of factors. As of early September 2025, the price stood at $3,588.06 per ounce, but this figure is subject to constant change. Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty, all of which can increase investor interest. Additionally, interest rates, currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks holding large gold reserves play a significant role in its valuation.

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson stated that he should have controlled his emotions after shoving a Buffalo Bills fan during a game. The incident occurred after the fan slapped both Jackson and a teammate on their helmets while they were celebrating a touchdown. Jackson acknowledged that he "forgot where I was for a little bit" and should have let security handle the situation, which resulted in the fan's ejection from the stadium. Despite the altercation and the Ravens' narrow 41-40 loss, the two-time MVP said he plans to continue interacting with fans during celebrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high inflation and interest rates, financial experts are advising consumers on how to curb credit card spending to avoid accumulating high-interest debt. Key strategies include creating and adhering to a seasonal budget by reviewing past expenses, and using debit or cash for everyday purchases to create a stronger psychological connection to spending. Other effective methods involve removing saved credit card information from online shopping accounts to add friction to impulse buys, setting up transaction alerts, and avoiding "buy now, pay later" services that can obscure total debt. These habits are designed to promote more conscious financial decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig striking a protester on the ground, with the artist confirming its authenticity via an Instagram post. While not referencing a specific event, its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest in the city. The piece was quickly covered with plastic sheeting by authorities and placed under security guard. This work is consistent with Banksy's history of creating politically charged art that is often critical of government and authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, being genuinely likable is a skill built on making others feel seen and valued, rather than being "fake nice." Highly likable individuals consistently practice small habits such as remembering minor details about others, which demonstrates that they are actively listening. They also give credit freely to colleagues, respond to communications from everyone regardless of status, and readily admit when they are wrong. Furthermore, they make time for seemingly "unimportant" small talk, recognizing these interactions as crucial for building strong, human connections and fostering trust over time.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team must decide who will replace star full-back Ellie Kildunne for their World Cup quarter-final match against Scotland. Kildunne, the reigning World Rugby player of the year, is unavailable due to concussion symptoms sustained in a previous match. The two primary candidates for the position are the less experienced specialist Emma Sing and the versatile veteran Helena Rowland. While Sing offers strong goal-kicking, Rowland's experience and impressive performance off the bench in the last game may give her the edge for the crucial knockout stage match, according to rugby analysts.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists argue that its overall impact on the job market remains relatively small and that recent hiring slowdowns are more attributable to general economic uncertainty. The effects of AI-driven job changes have so far been largely concentrated within the tech industry, which constitutes a small fraction of the total U.S. workforce. Studies indicate that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields have seen some employment decline, but experts suggest many companies are more likely to retrain existing employees with AI skills rather than implement mass layoffs.

The cancellation, effective May 2026, was controversial, coming after Colbert criticized a CBS legal settlement with Donald Trump, who later celebrated the show's demise.
