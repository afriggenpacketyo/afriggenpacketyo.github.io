          <h2>Mike Waltz's Signal Use During Cabinet Meeting Sparks Controversy Before UN Ambassadorship Nomination</h2>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, showing chats with figures like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This incident occurred a day before President Trump announced Waltz's replacement and nomination as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of Signal, stating it's an approved app. However, this follows previous scrutiny over Waltz's Signal communications, including an incident where a journalist was inadvertently invited to a group chat discussing a U.S. attack in Yemen. The Pentagon's watchdog also criticized a former official's Signal use in 2021, citing breaches of record retention policies.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has taken on four significant government positions, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist, and Interim National Security Advisor, leading to questions about his capacity to effectively manage these roles.

The article notes the unprecedented nature of holding so many titles simultaneously and raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist role overseeing record preservation for agencies Rubio also leads.

          <p>President Trump's Title IX investigative team is launching an investigation into Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal's office over its policy allowing biologically male trans athletes on girls' sports teams. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon accused Washington state of coercing districts into hiding 'gender identity' information from parents and smuggling gender ideology into classrooms. Reykdal defended his office's enforcement of state laws regarding transgender athletes and stated it was inaccurate to say there are only two genders. The Kennewick School Board filed a Title IX complaint against Reykdal's office in March, and other districts have taken stands against the policy.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully remained at historically low levels in April, marking three months since President Trump implemented aggressive immigration policies. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but consistent with February's figures. These numbers contrast sharply with the high levels of illegal crossings during the Biden administration. The Trump administration attributes the decrease to its stringent immigration measures, including rapid deportations, increased troop deployment, and the dismantling of Biden-era programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, potentially increasing prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. The "de minimis" exemption, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, allowed these companies to ship goods directly to the US without paying duties or import taxes. Trump's administration stated that the loophole was being exploited to smuggle illegal goods, including fentanyl. The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China, and could lead to similar reviews of low-value imports in the UK and EU.</p>
