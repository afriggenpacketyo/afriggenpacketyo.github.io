          <p>Haji Wright, a forward for the United States national team, will be sidelined for the rest of the Concacaf Gold Cup due to an Achilles injury. The 27-year-old scored in the opening match against Trinidad and Tobago but will now return to Coventry City for treatment. Coach Mauricio Pochettino expressed concern about the injury, which Wright apparently had before the tournament, and is unsure if midfielders Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso will be healthy enough to start in the upcoming game. In addition, Pochettino voiced his hope that the national team would receive a White House invitation.</p>

          <p>Japan has repatriated the remains of 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the country's first such repatriation. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries, were held by three Japanese research institutions and were returned following a survey by Japan's education ministry at Australia's request. This repatriation aligns with a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad for research or collection. Australia has been working for over 30 years to secure the return of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remains, repatriating over 1,785 sets from overseas collections.</p>

          <p>The presence of a senior Taiwanese officer at a U.S. military exercise in Alaska has garnered significant attention, signaling potential closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force's flight training division, attended Red Flag Alaska 25-2 as an observer. Analysts suggest the move indicates the U.S. commitment to its security alliances in the region, despite President Trump‚Äôs transactional approach. The exercise involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and other countries.</p>

The FDA warns that individuals with a milk allergy or sensitivity could experience serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume the affected products.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The universities argued that the move threatened critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, semiconductors, and other technology fields. The Trump administration sought to cap indirect expenses at 15% of the funding for direct research costs.</p>
