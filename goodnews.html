          <p>Bubba Wallace secured a historic victory at the Brickyard 400, becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's oval track. The win, his third career victory, snapped a 100-race winless streak for the 23XI Racing driver. Wallace overcame a late rain delay, two overtime restarts, and fuel concerns to hold off a charging Kyle Larson. He attributed his shifted mindset and recent success to his new perspective as a father, emphasizing family over racing.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a significant trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported into the US. The agreement, finalized between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, averts a threatened 30% tariff. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to increasing its investment in the US by $600 billion and purchasing $750 billion in American energy, aiming to rebalance the transatlantic trade relationship. Certain goods, including aircraft parts and some agricultural products, will be exempt from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Honeywell's recent stock performance suggests that despite a "beat and raise" on earnings, the market reacted negatively, causing a significant price drop. The article attributes the decline to factors like the complexity of its upcoming three-way split, a lack of significant data center exposure, and general market impatience. The author expresses conviction in the company's long-term value, citing its strong aerospace and automation businesses and the leadership of CEO Vimal Kapur. The plan is to purchase more shares, viewing the current low price as an opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>
