          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in the UK Parliament that would allow for an additional two years of imprisonment for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from avoiding justice and provide a sense of closure for victims' families. The bill could apply to cases in the Crown Court, including those who are disruptive and removed from court. While some believe an extra two years may not be a significant deterrent, restricting family visits and parole eligibility are other options being considered.</p>
