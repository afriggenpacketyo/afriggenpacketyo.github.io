          <p>This article investigates whether debt accumulated through "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services qualifies for debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans can technically be included, but eligibility often depends on the specific provider, some of whom may not negotiate settlements. For consumers struggling with these payments, the article also suggests alternative strategies such as direct negotiation with the lender, debt consolidation, or seeking guidance from a credit counselor.</p>

Unlike a previous contentious meeting, this session was characterized by a more collegial tone, with Zelenskyy adopting more formal attire and a flattering approach.

          <p>This article clarifies the rules regarding age limits for purchasing annuities, a financial product designed to provide a guaranteed income stream during retirement. While federal law does not impose a maximum age, individual insurance providers typically set their own limits, often around 85 years old. The optimal time to buy an annuity is not based on a specific age but should align with an individual's broader retirement strategy, health, and financial objectives.</p>
