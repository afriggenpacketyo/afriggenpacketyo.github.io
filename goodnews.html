          <p>Leaked audio from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, raising concerns about his cognitive abilities. The audio reveals Biden struggling to recall the year of his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected president, requiring staff to correct him. This reinforces Hur's conclusion that Biden's memory was "significantly limited," leading him to describe the president as a "well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory." The White House had previously kept the audio under wraps, and the release has sparked criticism and renewed debate about Biden's fitness for office.</p>

Residents reported feeling the dirt in the air, and the skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas.</p>
