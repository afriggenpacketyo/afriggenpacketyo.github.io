          <p>Following the release of all living Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the next phase of the Gaza peace plan faces significant challenges. Mediated by Egypt and Qatar, the deal's initial steps have been met, but future negotiations will tackle more contentious issues. These include the governance of postwar Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm, and Palestinian calls for statehood, all of which face opposition from one or both sides. The plan also outlines the need for an international security force and billions in aid for reconstruction.</p>

          <p>This article revisits Orson Welles' infamous 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds," which simulated a Martian invasion and reportedly caused widespread panic. It explores how the event became a historical touchstone for discussions on media credibility and the public's susceptibility to misinformation, a lesson that remains highly relevant in the age of social media and AI-generated deepfakes. The broadcast was an intentional assault on the blind trust people placed in radio, aiming to teach listeners to be more skeptical of what they hear. The article argues for the continued importance of media literacy.</p>

Bright was a pivotal figure in the Lionesses' success, including their Euro 2022 victory and their run to the 2023 World Cup final, where she served as captain. While her decision is not a surprise, it marks a changing of the guard for the team as younger defenders emerge.

          <p>In a podcast interview, former President Barack Obama criticized businesses, universities, and other institutions for making deals or compromising their principles in response to pressure from the Trump administration. He argued that these organizations had the capacity to "take a stand" against policies they disagreed with, such as rollbacks of diversity initiatives. Obama suggested that instead of conceding, they should have been prepared to endure potential discomfort or financial consequences to uphold their core values and independence. He also reflected on the dangers of a "holier than thou" attitude in progressive discourse.</p>

          <p>South Africa's women's cricket team achieved a dramatic three-wicket victory against Bangladesh in the World Cup, recovering from a significant top-order collapse. Chasing a target of 233, the Proteas were struggling at 78-5 before half-centuries from Chloe Tryon and Marizanne Kapp revived their chances. Nadine de Klerk, the hero of a previous match, once again guided the team to victory with an unbeaten 37, sealing the win with a six in the final over. The narrow loss was heartbreaking for Bangladesh, who were let down by several crucial dropped catches.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has provided a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina's central bank in an effort to stabilize the country's volatile peso and prevent a potential financial crisis. The move is intended to address acute liquidity concerns ahead of Argentina's key midterm elections. While the intervention aims to support the government of President Javier Milei, a U.S. ally, it has drawn criticism due to Argentina's history of debt defaults. This marks the first U.S. intervention of its kind since the 1995 Mexico bailout. (not investment advice)</p>
