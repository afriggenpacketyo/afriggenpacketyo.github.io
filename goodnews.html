          <p>China experienced a significant surge in inbound tourism during the Labor Day holiday, with bookings jumping 141% year-on-year, attributed to relaxed visa policies and improved travel services. Domestic tourism also saw modest growth, with cross-region trips expected to increase by 8%. This travel boom is part of China's efforts to boost domestic spending amid trade tensions with the United States. However, box office sales during the holiday are expected to fall short of previous years, indicating a mixed economic picture.</p>

          <p>A black woodpecker, a threatened species, has been identified in a 2021 photograph, marking its first sighting on Japan's main island of Honshu in four years. The bird, an adult male, was photographed on Mt. Moriyoshi in Akita prefecture, the same location as the last sighting in 2017. While relatively common on Hokkaido, the Environment Ministry designates it as vulnerable, emphasizing the importance of gathering up-to-date information on sightings for its protection.

          <p>Roche has entered a $5.3 billion agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for obesity treatment, marking Roche's entry into competition with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The deal involves upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments reaching $5.3 billion. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, potentially offering better tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs.

          <p>China is showing signs of easing its ban on K-pop acts, signaling a potential boost to domestic demand and cultural exchange amid a trade war with the United States. K-pop concerts are being scheduled in mainland China for the first time since 2016, representing a "structural turning point" for the sector. K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible.
