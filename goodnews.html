          <p>Coventry City Football Club has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society Arena, its home stadium, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a pivotal moment, securing the club's long-term stability and future for generations of supporters. After years of uncertainty involving multiple stadium owners and home grounds since leaving Highfield Road in 2005, this move allows the club to control its own revenue streams and invest in facilities. The purchase, which includes the arena's hotel and casino, has been hailed as monumental by fans and former players.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to experience temperatures reaching 30C (86F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday, continuing what is on track to be one of the hottest summers on record. The warm, sunny weather is attributed to the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the country. While the heat provides ideal conditions for events like the Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festival, it will be short-lived. More unsettled weather, including wind and rain, is forecast to arrive on Tuesday and persist for the remainder of the week as the storm system moves over the British Isles.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 11:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a five-year legal battle, a central Berlin street formerly known as 'Mohrenstrasse' (Moor Street) has been officially renamed 'Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse'. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German philosopher from the 18th century who was the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Activists had campaigned for decades to change the name, which has racist connotations linked to the enslavement of Africans in Prussia. The renaming, finalized on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, is seen as a significant step in Germany's efforts to decolonize public spaces and acknowledge its colonial history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami, sending a wave over 1,400 feet up the opposite shore in a popular tourist area. Scientists and officials consider it a fortunate near-miss, as the event occurred early in the morning when the fjord was empty of tour boats and cruise ships. The incident highlights the growing risk of such events as climate change causes glaciers to retreat, potentially destabilizing mountain walls. Scientists are studying whether glacial 'de-buttressing' and thawing permafrost are increasing the frequency of these hazardous landslides in coastal regions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has significantly expanded a previous ruling, now blocking the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to 34 cities and counties with 'sanctuary' policies. The order by U.S. District Judge William Orrick adds major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago to the list of jurisdictions protected from the administration's threats. The ruling affirms that it is unconstitutional to withhold funds from local governments that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This decision marks a major setback for the administration's efforts to compel local cooperation on immigration through financial pressure.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, sending fountains of lava 100 feet into the air within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to homes. The spectacle is drawing visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, offering a dramatic display of nature. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that the frequent episodes are caused by magma building up in a chamber before being forcefully pushed to the surface through narrow vents, a pattern observed in previous eruption cycles.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment in the United States, according to The Princeton Review. The rankings considered academics, financial aid, college costs, and post-graduation earnings to determine which schools offer the best value. Georgia Tech's strong focus on STEM fields likely contributes to the high median salaries its graduates command, solidifying its reputation as a top-value institution. The report highlights that while sticker price is a factor, a school's ability to provide a strong educational foundation for future success is a key component of its overall value.

          <p>A restaurateur who had lost function in his left arm and leg after a stroke has experienced significant recovery thanks to a new medical device called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved technology involves an implant that stimulates the vagus nerve during rehabilitation exercises, which is believed to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. After his progress with traditional therapy plateaued, the patient received the implant and has since regained significant movement and function. Neurosurgeons believe this first-of-its-kind technology could redefine what is possible for stroke survivors who have moderate to severe long-term deficits.</p>

The project, which has received backing from the U.S. and European partners, is part of a plan to create a cross-continental railway connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans through Zambia and Tanzania. Despite the Western support, the CEO emphasized that LAR maintains strong business ties with China, relying on Chinese manufacturing for equipment and providing logistics for Chinese-owned mining companies.

          <p>As older generations prepare to pass down an estimated $25 trillion in real estate, wealth advisors are highlighting the potential for financial and emotional conflict among heirs. To mitigate disputes and tax burdens, experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust at death to take advantage of a stepped-up cost basis, rather than gifting it during one's lifetime. Using legal structures like LLCs can shield the property from lawsuits and creditors. It is also crucial for parents to create a detailed operating agreement for shared properties and set aside liquid assets to cover ongoing expenses like maintenance and insurance.

          <p>The latest season of the animated series 'South Park' is directing sharp, unrestrained satire at the Trump administration, with parodies of figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance. This direct critique comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, has been under scrutiny from the administration and recently agreed to hire an ombudsman to address 'bias' at its CBS network. Despite this pressure, 'South Park' creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are leveraging their creative freedom and a new billion-dollar streaming deal to deliver some of their most pointed political commentary to date, resulting in record ratings.</p>
