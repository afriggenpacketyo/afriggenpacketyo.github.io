          <p>Alibaba, JD.com, and ByteDance's Douyin are preparing for China‚Äôs 618 shopping festival, a major online sales event, amid a nationwide price war due to weak consumer spending. The companies are launching discount campaigns, with Douyin investing heavily in cash subsidies. The event, initiated by JD in 2004, has evolved into a significant annual sales event where e-commerce firms compete with steep discounts and subsidies. This year's festival is particularly crucial as companies aim to stimulate consumer spending in a challenging economic environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump believes that the Fed should cut rates to counteract a potential economic slowdown resulting from his trade policies. The Fed, however, is hesitant to lower rates due to concerns that Trump's tariffs could spark inflation. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions will not be influenced by political pressure and will solely focus on economic data and outlook.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in children's lives due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancy, and the rising costs of child care. They provide numerous benefits, including better educational and mental health outcomes for children. However, grandparents are also increasingly stepping in to fill gaps in America‚Äôs child care system, which can be a burden. Experts suggest policymakers should implement reforms that allow grandparents to spend time with their grandkids because they want to, not because they have no other choice.</p>

          <p>An Irish woman, Cliona Ward, who had been detained by US immigration authorities due to a decades-old criminal record, has been released after 17 days in custody.

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of a trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, and vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. The details of the agreement were not yet clear and could prove contentious with farmers and other interest groups in Britain. Starmer has steadfastly refused to criticize Trump, either on trade or his statements about Ukraine and its war with Russia. The prime minister has tried to act as a bridge between Europe and the United States.</p>

          <p>The British government has made faster economic growth its top mission, and securing a trade deal with the United States is a welcome win. However, the agreement is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement and there are limits to how much it would support the British economy. The Bank of England cut interest rates, citing concerns about lingering price pressures and a short-term bump in inflation expected this year. The uncertainty created by Trump‚Äôs trade policy globally, rather than tariffs on Britain, is the greater threat to Britain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom are anticipated to unveil a comprehensive trade agreement, potentially alleviating the impact of President Trump's tariffs and offering a political advantage to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement seeks to lower or eliminate U.S. import taxes on U.K. cars and steel, while Britain aims to maintain its food standards, rejecting imports of chlorine-rinsed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Starmer's government views the deal as validation of its conciliatory approach toward President Trump, in contrast to the European Union's retaliatory tariffs. While this agreement is symbolically important, it may not fully address the underlying trade deficit concerns that prompted the initial tariffs.</p>
