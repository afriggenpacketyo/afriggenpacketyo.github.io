          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, driven by a record performance in its trading division. The bank's trading revenue reached an unprecedented $8.9 billion for a third quarter, benefiting from market volatility that has prompted investors to reposition their portfolios. Investment banking fees also saw a significant jump, contributing to an overall 9% rise in revenue to $47.12 billion. While CEO Jamie Dimon noted the resilient U.S. economy, he also highlighted growing uncertainties from geopolitical conditions and potential inflation, leading the bank to increase its provision for credit losses.

          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced it will deploy 50,000 of AMD's advanced AI graphics processors, with the rollout starting in the latter half of 2026. This move signals a growing trend among cloud providers to offer alternatives to Nvidia's dominant GPUs for artificial intelligence workloads. Oracle will utilize AMD's Instinct MI450 chips, which are designed for large-scale AI systems and have been publicly endorsed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The deal underscores the increasing competition in the AI hardware market as companies seek to diversify their supply chains to meet the massive demand for computing power.</p>

          <p>Rockefeller Capital Management, a wealth manager with roots in John D. Rockefeller's original family office, has secured a new round of investment from several other ultra-wealthy families, including the Chanel dynasty's Mousse Partners. The recapitalization raises the firm's valuation to $6.6 billion, more than double its 2023 value. This new funding will support the firm's plans to expand its services for high-net-worth clients, hire more advisors, and potentially tap into international markets. The investment from other family offices is seen as a vote of confidence in Rockefeller's long-term growth strategy in the wealth management sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at increasing online safety for children, addressing growing concerns over artificial intelligence and social media. One landmark law requires AI chatbots to disclose their non-human nature and prompt minors to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful content. Other new laws mandate social media platforms to add mental health warnings and increase penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. These measures force significant changes for Big Tech companies, many of which are based in California, establishing a new regulatory standard for the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury fashion brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe a total of more than €157 million for violating EU competition laws. The investigation found that the companies illegally restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices for their products. By imposing minimum sales prices and dictating discount rates and periods, the brands engaged in anti-competitive behavior that resulted in higher prices and reduced choices for consumers. The parent companies, including Kering and LVMH, were found to have interfered with their retailers' commercial strategies, undermining a fair marketplace.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced new content guidelines for Instagram that will limit what teenage users can see to a level comparable to a PG-13 movie rating. The changes will hide accounts that share sexualized content or material related to drugs and alcohol from teens, and they will no longer be able to follow such accounts. Additionally, posts containing swear words will not be recommended to them, though they can still be found via search. This move is a response to sustained criticism over the platform's impact on child safety and youth mental health, aiming to provide parents with a more familiar standard for content moderation.</p>

          <p>Former England bowler Stuart Broad has asserted that Australia's current team is arguably its "worst since 2010" as they prepare for the upcoming Ashes series. Responding to predictions of a dominant Australian victory, Broad argued that the Australian side is under immense pressure as favorites but faces significant questions regarding their lineup and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. He contrasted this with what he considers the best English team since their last victory in Australia in 2010-11. Broad suggests these factors combined could lead to a highly competitive and unpredictable series between the two historic rivals.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire is holding in Gaza, marked by a significant exchange where Hamas released its remaining 20 living Israeli hostages and Israel freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees. The event brought rare moments of joy to both sides, though the long-term stability of the truce remains uncertain. Key contentious issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza, are unresolved. World leaders gathered in Egypt to advocate for extending the current pause into a durable peace, with the U.S. president claiming a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, entering a crowded Democratic primary with the goal of unseating Republican incumbent Susan Collins. Mills, who was reportedly recruited by national party leaders, is positioning herself as a battle-tested leader ready to challenge the Trump administration's influence. Her entry sets up a potentially divisive primary against more progressive candidates who are critical of the party establishment. The race is expected to be a key battleground as Democrats aim to regain control of the Senate in the upcoming election cycle.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt for their foundational research into how technological innovation drives sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work explains why the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, emphasizing the unique combination of scientific breakthroughs with a skilled class of entrepreneurs who could apply them practically. Aghion and Howitt developed a key theory centered on "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace outdated ones, which they argue is essential for long-term progress. Their collective work provides a framework for understanding the crucial link between technological disruption and prosperity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are preparing for their upcoming game in London by first spending the week in Baltimore, using the Orioles' baseball stadium, Camden Yards, as a temporary base. This strategy of staying on the East Coast after a game to acclimate before traveling to Europe has been used by the team in previous seasons. Players and coaches are adjusting their weekly routines, including bodywork and recovery sessions, to the unfamiliar environment. The extended trip is seen as a way to help the team bond and maintain focus by minimizing travel disruption ahead of their international matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
