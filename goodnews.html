          <p>An anti-corruption investigation in Guizhou, China, has led to the downfall of officials connected to the province's big data sector. Guizhou, once an underdeveloped region, had heavily invested in big data to boost its economy, attracting tech giants like Huawei and Apple. The investigation highlights the tension between state-led innovation and accountability. China's anti-corruption efforts are increasingly targeting industries considered strategically important, including big data and semiconductors, as the country seeks self-reliance amidst its competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>An expert discusses the concept of "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes emotional attunement, resilience, trust, and connection. This approach involves accepting children's emotions without dismissal, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility for conflicts, create a safe environment for expressing emotions, and embrace the whole child. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair.</p>
