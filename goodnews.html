        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trade negotiations between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its planned digital services tax on U.S. technology companies. The decision came after President Trump suspended talks, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump spoke by phone, agreeing to restart negotiations toward a new economic and security relationship. The move is seen by some analysts as a concession by Canada to appease the White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UEFA has postponed its decision on whether Crystal Palace can compete in next season's Europa League, a spot the club earned by winning the FA Cup. The issue stems from multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified. The decision is now pending the outcome of Lyon's appeal against a demotion to Ligue 2 due to financial issues. If Lyon's appeal fails, they have agreed to relinquish their Europa League spot, which would clear the way for Palace.</p>

          <p>New research conducted on monkeys has identified a potential link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in a specific protein. The study, published in Nature Aging, provides a detailed molecular map of aging patterns in the primate cochlea. Furthermore, the scientists discovered that the common diabetes medication metformin was able to slow the progression of hearing loss in the animals. These findings could pave the way for developing new treatments and personalized medicine for this common condition in humans.</p>

          <p>China is taking a bold, unrestrained approach to using artificial intelligence in its entertainment industry, a sharp contrast to the caution seen in Hollywood. A government-backed foundation plans to use AI to "revitalize" 100 classic kung fu films, including creating animated reinterpretations of iconic movies. This initiative highlights differing global views on AI's role in creative fields, as U.S. guilds and studios grapple with concerns over labor displacement and intellectual property.

          <p>This story recounts an act of unexpected kindness from 1990 that left a lasting impact. As a college freshman, Karen de Boer overslept and missed the bus for a crucial choir performance, fearing it would end her chances of going on an international tour. Distraught, she was found by her hallmate, Pam, whom de Boer and her friends had frequently annoyed with their noise. Despite their rocky relationship, Pam immediately offered to drive her the hour-long distance to the church, a gesture of forgiveness and generosity that de Boer has cherished for over 30 years.</p>

          <h2>How to Best Support a Friend Diagnosed with Cancer</h2>

          <p>This article offers advice for supporting someone with a cancer diagnosis, drawing on insights from survivors and patient advocates. Key recommendations include simply reaching out and being present, as social isolation is a common and painful experience for patients. It's better to ask and listen rather than talk, avoiding platitudes or comparisons to others. When offering help, be specific with suggestions like "Can I drop off a pizza?" instead of a vague "Let me know if you need anything." Support should also continue after treatment ends, as the recovery journey is often long.</p>
