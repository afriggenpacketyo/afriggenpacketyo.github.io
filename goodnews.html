          <p>NFL Week Three delivered extraordinary drama, with unheralded kickers and backup quarterbacks dominating a Sunday featuring five last-play finishes. The Philadelphia Eagles mounted their largest home comeback since 1988, blocking a last-gasp field goal by the Los Angeles Rams and returning it for a touchdown to maintain their unbeaten record. The Cleveland Browns also achieved a significant upset, ending an eight-game losing streak by blocking a potential game-winning field goal from the Green Bay Packers and kicking a 55-yarder for their first victory. Other key outcomes included the Kansas City Chiefs' initial win, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 3-0 start, and the surprising 3-0 run of the Indianapolis Colts, highlighted by quarterback Daniel 'Indiana' Jones's historic performance.</p>

          <p>Singapore's core inflation rate unexpectedly softened to 0.3% in August, marking its lowest rise since February 2021 and falling below economists' projections. Headline inflation also decreased to 0.5% from July's 0.6%. This easing trend occurs as the city-state prepares for slower economic growth in the latter half of 2025, despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects core inflation to average 0.5% to 1.5% for 2025, a significant reduction from 2.8% in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding previously frozen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge granted a preliminary injunction, citing the government's likely violation of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific details for the cuts. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million in National Science Foundation grants to UCLA. The frozen funds, primarily for medical research, were part of the administration's broader efforts to pressure elite colleges over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.</p>

This update follows President Trump's social media announcement of a potential meeting around a South Korea summit next month, a detail not included in China's readout. Perdue's comments came during a rare visit by a bipartisan US House delegation to Beijing, aimed at boosting communication, particularly on military issues and resolving differences over TikTok. The ambassador described the relationship between the two presidents as "very good and very encouraging."</p>

          <p>Former Premier League manager Sam Allardyce observes that modern football is increasingly adopting the direct, set-piece-focused tactics he championed decades ago. Allardyce, known for guiding Bolton Wanderers to Europe with a less possession-based style, notes a resurgence in long balls, big strikers, and emphasis on set-pieces, which were once heavily criticized. He highlights coaches like Luis Enrique adopting his old habit of watching games from the stands for a better overview. The article suggests a shift away from "playing out from the back" due to the high risk of conceding goals, indicating a return to more pragmatic, efficient strategies in the sport.</p>

          <p>Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, identifies resilience as a critical leadership trait for navigating the fashion industry's current challenges, including new tariffs and economic uncertainty. Weir's tenure began as President Donald Trump imposed "reciprocal" tariffs on over 180 countries, impacting key manufacturing hubs and potentially forcing brands to choose between price hikes and tighter margins. Despite these "very challenging" conditions, Weir maintains an optimistic outlook, stressing the importance of collaborative efforts with American counterparts to mitigate the tariffs' impact. She also highlights listening and open dialogue as essential qualities for modern leaders.</p>

          <p>While major European financial centers face an IPO drought, Stockholm's Stock Exchange is thriving, raising nearly $2 billion in 2025. This success is attributed to Sweden's deeply ingrained "equity culture," diverse domestic capital, and supportive regulatory framework. About 70% of Swedish household wealth is in equity, significantly higher than the EU average, fostered by decades of government policies like tax-incentivized savings funds. The market also benefits from an efficient IPO process, including "cornerstone" investors and a steady supply of private equity-backed companies. Despite its current strength, the market's health remains contingent on the performance of its newest listings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disney has reinstated Jimmy Kimmel Live! after suspending the show due to comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which Disney deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The suspension followed threats from the FCC chair and sparked widespread debate over free speech, drawing criticism from politicians, media figures, and free-speech organizations. Kimmel had satirized the Trump administration's reaction to Kirk's death. Disney stated that "thoughtful conversations" led to the decision, though some ABC affiliates, like Sinclair, plan to continue replacing the show with news programming, indicating ongoing fallout from the controversy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest as part of the ancient tradition of pannage, a practice dating back to 1079. Initiated due to a "heavy acorn crop," the pigs graze on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle. This ecological stewardship helps maintain the health of the New Forest ecosystem. Officials remind visitors to keep a safe distance and drive carefully, as reports of pigs being struck by cars have occurred. Pannage season is expected to conclude in late November.</p>
