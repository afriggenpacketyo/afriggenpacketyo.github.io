          <p>A two-ton elephant seal surprised residents of Gordon's Bay, South Africa, when it wandered into a residential area. The seal, identified as a young male, was seen lumbering along a street, prompting a rescue effort involving police, a security company, and animal welfare officials. After being contained and sedated, the seal was safely transported back to a nearby bay. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA noted that southern elephant seals are not commonly found in South Africa, making this "unexpected journey" a rare event, which required careful coordination to ensure everyone's safety.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is proposing a new strategy for the Black Sea region, including the establishment of a "maritime security hub" to counter Russian influence and enhance security. The hub aims to improve situational awareness, information sharing, and real-time monitoring of potential threats. The EU hopes to foster closer collaboration with Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in trade, energy, and transport cooperation. While the plan's specifics, such as the hub's location and funding, remain unclear, it signals a more active EU role in the region's security, which is crucial for connectivity with other regions like the South Caucasus and the Middle East.</p>

Republicans are attempting to pass the GENIUS Act to regulate digital assets, with Democrats previously rejecting it due to concerns about President Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures creating a conflict of interest.

Trump's orders aim to expedite the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) approval process for new nuclear plants. GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, and the Tennessee Valley Authority has applied to build a GE Vernova reactor at Oak Ridge, Tenn.

This strategy comes as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and aim to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations.

          <p>A new study by Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that domestic cats can differentiate between the smell of their owner and that of a stranger. The study found that cats spent significantly more time sniffing tubes containing the odours of unknown people compared to tubes containing their owner's smell, indicating they can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on odour. Researchers suggest cats use their strong sense of smell to identify and communicate with other cats, and this may extend to people.
