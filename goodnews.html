          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals have signed first-round draft pick Shemar Stewart, ending a prolonged and tense contract dispute. The defensive end from Texas A&M was the last 2025 first-round pick to sign his deal, which is reportedly worth a fully guaranteed $18.97 million. The standoff stemmed from the team's attempt to restructure rookie contract guarantees, a move Stewart publicly resisted. With Stewart now signed, the Bengals can focus on improving a defense that struggled last season.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals have ended a protracted contract dispute by signing their first-round draft pick, defensive end Shemar Stewart. The standoff, which centered on the structure of future guarantees in the rookie contract, had kept Stewart from participating in training camp. The newly signed deal is reportedly worth $18.97 million, fully guaranteed, with a $10 million signing bonus, making Stewart the final 2025 first-round pick to sign. His addition is a crucial step for the Bengals as they look to improve their defense from last season.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated at Denver International Airport following a landing gear issue during its takeoff roll. The Boeing 737 MAX 8, carrying 173 passengers and six crew, experienced a problem with a tire, leading to a small fire that was extinguished by the fire department. All occupants were safely deplaned and transported back to the terminal, with one person taken for medical attention for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop, but airport operations have since returned to normal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the agency has played a crucial role in American history, with Benjamin Franklin serving as its first postmaster general. The celebration occurs amid recent discussions about the agency's future, including potential privatization, though the new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated his opposition to such a move. The event aims to honor the Postal Service's past while also looking toward its future.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief, as a more serious injury was feared. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days, hoping to return initially as a designated hitter. The injury was first felt during a game against Toronto after making a strong throw to home plate.</p>

          <p>Following the passing of Ozzy Osbourne, this article reflects on his unexpected second wave of fame as a reality TV star in the early 2000s. "The Osbournes" pioneered the "reality sitcom" genre, offering an unfiltered, mundane, and often chaotic look into the life of the heavy metal icon and his family. The show's success, blending celebrity life with relatable family dynamics, paved the way for future celebrity-driven reality programs like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." Producers and critics note that the show captured a genuine, if sometimes curated, family dynamic that resonated with millions of viewers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with July's average temperature running about a degree below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which has allowed a low-pressure system to persist over the region, leading to more cloud cover and cooler weather. This has also increased coastal upwelling, where cold ocean water is brought to the surface, further lowering land temperatures. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters caution that the Bay Area's hottest days often occur in September and October.</p>

However, many fans defended Sweeney and the ad, with some celebrating it for "killing woke advertising." Meanwhile, American Eagle executives are betting on Sweeney's star power to revive sales, as the brand's stock saw a notable increase following the campaign's launch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, aiming to prevent closures due to noise issues. The reforms also seek to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and expanding outdoor service areas to revitalize struggling town centers. While the government touts the changes as a boost for hospitality, the opposition argues that other Labour tax policies are harming the industry.</p>
