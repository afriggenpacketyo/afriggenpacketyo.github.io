          <p>A dedicated conservation effort is underway in Texas to save the state's desert bighorn sheep population, which has been reduced by 50% due to disease. Wildlife biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range. This relocation aims to establish a new, protected breeding population. Recent observations have confirmed the presence of newborn lambs, signaling that the herd is beginning to grow again in its new home.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is releasing approximately $6.8 billion in federal funding for K-12 education programs that had been previously frozen. The decision to withhold the congressionally approved funds had drawn a lawsuit from over 20 Democratic attorneys general and criticism from bipartisan governors. The Department of Education stated that the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the funds, which support programs for low-income students and teacher training, and would begin dispersing them to states the following week.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether popular health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps, are rigid requirements for a healthy life. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks are useful guidelines, they are not one-size-fits-all, and there is significant room for individual variation. The consensus is that consistency and a balanced approach are more important than fixating on specific numbers, and listening to one's body is often the best guide for maintaining well-being.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is taking place in women's sports, as researchers focus on the unique ways the female body is affected by elite athletic activity. This new field of study examines topics like how breast movement impacts running mechanics, how the menstrual cycle can affect performance, and why female athletes face a higher risk for certain injuries, such as ACL tears. The goal is to move beyond treating female athletes as "mini-men" and to use science to improve their health, safety, and performance.</p>

          <p>After 25 years as a television staple, reality TV may have a more positive societal impact than its critics acknowledge, according to some experts. While often dismissed as superficial, the genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering viewers a glimpse into different social landscapes. Psychologists suggest that by featuring ordinary people and prompting national conversations on topics like disability, coercive control, and body image, reality TV can help build social understanding and make people feel less isolated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in demand for matcha, fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, is causing a global supply shortage. This "matcha mania" has been compounded by poor harvests due to record heatwaves, an aging farmer population, and U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods. As a result, consumers are facing empty shelves and soaring prices for the popular green tea powder, with some retailers forced to limit how much each customer can buy.</p>
