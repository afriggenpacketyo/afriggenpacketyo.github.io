          <p>During Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, McLaren driver Lando Norris crashed into a wall, causing significant damage to his car and disrupting his session. The incident was costly for Norris, who missed crucial high-fuel race simulation runs, leaving him behind on data collection. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton led a Ferrari one-two, finishing just ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc, who has a strong record at the Baku circuit. Despite Ferrari's strong showing, Leclerc noted that McLaren's true pace was likely hidden and expects them to be highly competitive in qualifying.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has clarified that he was not pressured by President Trump on how to vote regarding this week's interest rate decision. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the one enacted, stated his conversation with the president was brief and congratulatory. This comes amid heightened concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence, as Trump has been openly critical of the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell. Miran affirmed his decision was made independently and dismissed concerns about a potential conflict of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 11:36:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. retailers are increasingly using a "tariff arbitrage" strategy, known as the B2B2C model, to reduce the financial impact of trade war tariffs on consumers. This method involves routing online orders through a middleman company that purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price. Companies like ESW and Global-e facilitate this process, which can cut tariff costs significantly, helping retailers avoid price increases. While some see this as an innovative adaptation, others warn it may attract regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

The team secured the win despite the absence of star player Caitlin Clark, who is out for the remainder of the season with an injury. Aliyah Boston scored the game-winning basket with just 7.4 seconds left, and a subsequent steal by Lexie Hull sealed the victory. The sixth-seeded Fever will now face the No. 2 seed Las Vegas Aces in the next round of the playoffs.</p>

          <p>A new initiative named DACH Against Hate has been launched in Germany to address the sharp increase in antisemitism since the October 7 Hamas attacks and the subsequent conflict in Gaza. Founded by academic Guy Katz and supported by over 200 organizations, the group aims to push for stricter legislation, improved education, and greater protection for Jewish institutions. The initiative's patron, 92-year-old Charlotte Knobloch, a Holocaust survivor, stated that life for Jews has changed radically and that the Middle East conflict is often used as a pretext to fuel hatred. The group has planned a large demonstration and an online petition.</p>

          <h2>Trump and Xi Discuss Finalizing Deal to Prevent US TikTok Ban</h2>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a phone call to finalize a deal for the social media platform TikTok. The discussion follows a framework agreement reached earlier in the week to prevent a U.S. ban on the app. The law, signed by former President Biden, requires TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American operations or face being shut down in the United States. Trump, who has previously extended the deadline for the divestiture, expressed his desire to preserve the platform's value and keep it operational for its American users.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man has been returned to France from the UK under a new "one in, one out" agreement after the government won a last-minute court challenge to his removal. This marks the first time ministers have successfully used the courts to enforce an immediate removal under the pilot scheme, which aims to deter small boat crossings. To win the case, the Home Office tightened rules around human trafficking claims, arguing they could be pursued from a safe country like France. For each migrant returned, the UK will accept another with a strong asylum case, as part of its strategy to disrupt smuggling gangs.</p>

          <h2>Apple CEO Clarifies Recent iPhone Price Increases Are Not Related to Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that the recent price increases for the new iPhone 17 Pro model are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the company's flagship New York store, Cook definitively separated the pricing strategy from the ongoing trade dispute. To mitigate the impact of levies, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, shifting some production to countries like India and Vietnam. Despite these efforts, the company reported an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the previous quarter, making Cook's clarification on iPhone pricing significant for consumers and investors.</p>

          <p>A potential agreement between the U.S. and China over TikTok's future may involve a licensing deal for the app's highly valued recommendation algorithm. This core technology has been a major obstacle in negotiations, with the Chinese government previously vowing to block its sale. A potential compromise could see a new U.S. entity re-creating the algorithm using technology licensed from ByteDance, addressing national security concerns while allowing the parent company to retain some intellectual property rights. This arrangement aims to resolve the ownership dispute that threatens to ban the popular app in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which creates a new tax deduction for tipped workers. The provision allows eligible employees to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 through 2028, with the benefit phasing out for higher earners. Key details confirm that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, will not qualify. Additionally, the guidance specifies that automatic gratuities will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments from customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The newly merged Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, with a potential offer in the range of $22 to $24 per share. This speculative price range was reported as the media company considers a large cash offer that could create a new industry giant. The move could preempt Warner Bros. Discovery's own recently announced plans to separate its global television networks from its streaming and studio businesses. A potential acquisition would consolidate a vast portfolio of entertainment assets, including major film studios, pay TV networks, and valuable sports rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CDC vaccine advisory panel has unexpectedly reversed its course, deciding not to proceed with a vote that could have altered the long-standing recommendation for all newborns to receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), recently reconstituted with members appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also reversed a previous day's vote regarding coverage for the combined MMRV vaccine. The chair attributed the reversals to the panel's inexperience, while medical experts expressed relief that the established and effective hepatitis B policy would remain unchanged for now.</p>

Investors in longer-term debt are weighing not only future rate expectations but also the outlook for economic growth, inflation, and government finances.
