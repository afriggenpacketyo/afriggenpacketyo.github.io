          <p>Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has promised reforms and investments as centrist parties formally signed a coalition agreement. The CDU-CSU/SPD coalition plans changes to tax laws, migration policy, and a new voluntary military service model. A major fiscal policy shift will allow for higher defense spending and a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure and climate fund. Analysts suggest Merz and new Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will be key decision-makers, aiming to stabilize the government and counter the rise of the far-right AfD party.
