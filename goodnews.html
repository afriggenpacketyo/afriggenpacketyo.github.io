          <p>Following four days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000, the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia for peace talks. The meeting, facilitated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in his role as ASEAN chair, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump urged both nations to negotiate a ceasefire. While both sides have agreed to the talks, fighting continued over the weekend, with each country blaming the other for renewed shelling and troop movements. The diplomatic effort aims to de-escalate the long-standing border dispute.</p>

          <h2>Boeing Shows Signs of Stabilization and Improved Culture Under New CEO</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 08:46:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is reportedly stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company. Investors are responding positively, with stock prices up over 30% this year, as the manufacturer increases production and airplane deliveries hit an 18-month high. Analysts note a significant culture shift and expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Despite progress, Boeing still faces challenges, including an FAA production cap on its 737 Max and ongoing issues in its defense unit.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aborted its takeoff at Denver International Airport following a "possible landing gear incident." Passengers were evacuated via emergency slides after signs of a fire were observed underneath the aircraft. The airline confirmed that all customers and crew deplaned safely, with one person transported to a hospital for a minor injury. The incident, which passengers described as involving severe shaking and tilting, has prompted an inspection of the aircraft by maintenance teams. This is the second notable incident involving a major U.S. airline in recent days.</p>

          <p>A high-level European Union delegation, including President Ursula von der Leyen and Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, has arrived in Scotland for critical trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump. The meeting, held at Trump's Turnberry resort, aims to avert an escalating trade war, as Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports by an August 1 deadline. While Trump has publicly stated the chances of a deal are "50/50," both sides are under pressure to reach an agreement to stabilize global financial markets. A potential deal could establish a baseline tariff of 15% on EU goods.</p>

          <p>Former rugby player Matt Dawson writes that while the British and Irish Lions have already achieved a special series victory against Australia, they must win the final match to secure a 3-0 whitewash. He argues that this accomplishment would elevate the current squad to legendary status, a feat not achieved by the Lions in a major tour in nearly a century. Drawing parallels to his own 1997 Lions tour, Dawson notes that the current team is openly discussing the 3-0 goal, a sign of their ambition and the relative weakness of their opposition. He concludes that a complete series victory is necessary for this team to be celebrated for decades.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to raise the humanitarian situation in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland. Starmer is expected to support U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire and discuss further actions to urgently implement one, as aid agencies continue to warn of mass starvation in the region. The meeting comes amid mounting international pressure on Israel and stalled negotiations in Qatar. Domestically, Starmer faces calls to recognize a Palestinian state, a move his government is currently weighing against the timing and political implications.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Traces the History of Tipping in the U.S. to Post-Emancipation Labor Practices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States has its roots in the post-Civil War era, where it was used as a way for employers to avoid paying fair wages to formerly enslaved Black workers. This system evolved into the modern "tipped minimum wage," which under federal law is just $2.13 an hour, with the expectation that customer tips will make up the difference to the standard minimum wage. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this structure effectively shifts the responsibility of paying a worker's wage from the employer to the customer. This historical context explains why tipping is so ingrained in American service industries.</p>

          <p>This article provides financial guidance for a renter whose landlord has offered to sell them the house they currently occupy. It breaks down the hidden costs of homeownership that go beyond the monthly mortgage payment, which in this case is only slightly more than the current rent. Key considerations discussed include property taxes, homeowners insurance, maintenance costs, and the significant opportunity cost of tying up capital in real estate versus other investments like the stock market. The piece advises a thorough assessment of one's financial readiness before making such a major commitment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to extreme heat and drought in northern Guatemala, environmental groups have installed large, artificial watering holes in nature reserves to help wildlife survive. Motion-activated cameras set up nearby have captured incredible footage of a diverse range of animals, including elusive jaguars and tapirs, using the water sources. The project not only provides vital hydration for animals but also offers researchers valuable insights into their behavior. This initiative serves as a simple yet effective example of how humans can assist wildlife in adapting to the increasingly unpredictable conditions caused by climate change.</p>

          <p>This article serves as a guide to understanding sunscreens and their importance in preventing skin cancer and other damage from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It explains the difference between the two main types: organic (often called chemical) sunscreens that absorb UV rays, and physical sunscreens with zinc or titanium oxide that block them. While addressing reasonable safety concerns about certain chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, experts emphasize that the protective benefits of using sunscreen far outweigh the potential risks. The piece also warns against ineffective do-it-yourself sunscreens.</p>
