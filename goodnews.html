          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially incorporated over 6,000 new words and phrases, including popular internet slang like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." These additions highlight the significant impact of online culture and social media on the evolution of the English language. Other new entries reflect modern work-life, such as "mouse jiggler," and environmental concerns, like "forever chemical," demonstrating how the dictionary adapts to contemporary societal shifts. Lexicographers note that while terms born from internet culture are unusual, they are only added if they show potential for lasting usage.</p>

          <p>Most stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Monday, with investors closely watching for details following high-level talks between the United States and Russia concerning the war in Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's CSI 300 both advanced, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline. In the U.S., equity futures rose slightly amid hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which had contributed to a positive week on Wall Street. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, however, contracted more than expected in July, signaling some regional economic headwinds (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following a summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, a special U.S. envoy announced that Russia has agreed to let the U.S. and European allies offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense mandate. This development is being described as a potential "game-changing" concession in the effort to negotiate an end to the war. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the news, he noted that specific details on how such a pact would function remain unclear. The announcement comes as Zelenskyy and European leaders prepare to meet at the White House for further discussions.</p>

          <p>Australia's Federal Court has ordered Qantas Airways to pay a A$90 million ($58.64 million) fine for illegally terminating 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and replacing them with contractors. The judge stated the significant penalty was intended to act as a real deterrent and ensure it was not perceived as a mere cost of doing business. The case was brought by the Transport Workers' Union, which will receive A$50 million of the penalty on behalf of the fired employees. This ruling follows a separate A$120 million settlement previously agreed upon between Qantas and the union for the affected workers.</p>

          <p>Actress Dame Helen Mirren has expressed her view that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be portrayed by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, Mirren stated that changing the character's gender would fundamentally alter the role into something else. Her opinion was shared in an interview alongside former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also supports a male actor continuing in the role. This sentiment echoes previous comments from other figures associated with the franchise, who argue against a gender-swap for the famous spy as producers plan the next installment.</p>

          <p>A renewed sense of African pride and connection is growing across the Caribbean, strengthening cultural and economic bonds between the two regions. This modern wave of pan-Africanism is visible through increased interest in African food, music like Afrobeats, and tourism to the continent. Unlike past movements, this resurgence is bolstered by social media and concrete economic initiatives, with institutions like Afreximbank working to boost trade. Leaders are also calling for improved transportation links and even a shared digital currency to deepen the relationship, reflecting a powerful desire to reconnect with ancestral roots.</p>

          <p>An upcoming meeting at the White House between President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and key European leaders is being viewed as potentially more critical for Ukraine's future than the recent U.S.-Russia summit. European leaders are determined to present a united front, emphasizing that any peace deal must directly involve Ukraine and include robust, long-term security guarantees. The talks aim to ensure President Trump is not swayed by his rapport with Vladimir Putin into accepting terms unfavorable to Kyiv. The diplomatic challenge lies in balancing Ukraine's sovereignty with Russia's territorial demands to find a viable path to peace.</p>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has sparked significant controversy, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and those with religious ties to the practice. Authorities imposed the ban due to health risks from pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding birds is a pious act. The debate highlights a growing conflict in Indian cities between managing the ecological impact of a booming pigeon population and preserving long-standing cultural and religious traditions.</p>

          <p>Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, two of China's largest drug manufacturers, are poised to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is driven by the successful launch of new drugs and significant revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts project Hengrui's net profit to rise by 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift from generic drugs to more innovative medicines. This transition is expected to continue, with generics predicted to constitute a much smaller portion of the company's revenue in the coming years (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the UK is at a strategic crossroads as it holds its leadership election, with a central debate over whether to adopt a more aggressive, anti-elite political style. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for an "eco-populist" approach to connect with voter anger, contrasting with the more moderate, broad-appeal strategy of his opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns. The contest follows the party's record success in the last general election, where it quadrupled its number of parliamentary seats. The outcome will determine the party's direction as it seeks to build on its recent gains.</p>
