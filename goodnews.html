          <p>A recent study indicates that parents in Europe generally find their lives more meaningful compared to those without children, but they also experience lower levels of life satisfaction. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that this disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers. However, the degree of dissatisfaction varies significantly across countries, with Scandinavian nations showing smaller differences between parents and child-free individuals due to supportive family policies. Factors such as childcare availability, financial support, and gender equality play a crucial role in shaping parental satisfaction levels across different European contexts.</p>
