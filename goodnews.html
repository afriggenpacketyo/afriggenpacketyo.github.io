          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have initiated a new round of trade talks in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in a significant effort to pave the way for a potential meeting between the presidents of the world’s two largest economies. This marks their fifth face-to-face engagement since President Donald Trump escalated his trade war in April, threatening to increase tariffs on Chinese goods by an additional 100 percent starting November 1. The discussions are crucial for navigating complex China-US economic and trade relations, especially as a temporary trade truce is set to expire next month. The article underscores the ongoing diplomatic efforts to address persistent trade disputes and prevent further escalation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 23:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea is strategically aimed at resetting strained diplomatic ties, according to experts, even with limited expectations for immediate breakthroughs. This trip follows Xi's last visit in 2014, which coincided with the peak of Beijing-Seoul relations and culminated in a free-trade agreement. However, relations have since deteriorated, notably due to Beijing's past omission of "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" in joint statements, raising doubts about arms reduction prospects. The article suggests this carefully calibrated step is intended to recalibrate the complex diplomatic landscape between the two nations and foster renewed trust.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant boost just before early voting commences citywide. Jeffries lauded Mamdani's relentless focus on addressing the affordability crisis and his commitment to serving all New Yorkers, despite Mamdani's Democratic socialist platform drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. This backing adds to Mamdani's growing support from prominent Democrats and unions, while his opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, also secured a key endorsement from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The article also notes a controversy involving the Knicks, who issued a cease-and-desist over Mamdani's campaign ad using a modified team logo.</p>

Despite topping the short run on soft tires, Verstappen expressed dissatisfaction with his long-run pace during race simulations, citing a significant lack of grip as a "big concern" for the actual race. Norris, who finished fourth fastest, conceded that McLaren was "a little bit behind" and struggling with single-lap performance.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, with the impact of President Trump's tariffs remaining muted. This inflation data, released despite the ongoing government shutdown, is critical for determining the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries. Economists note that while U.S. businesses are absorbing some costs, tariffs contribute to upward price pressure, with companies passing on as much as 55% of import taxes to consumers. The article highlights the Federal Reserve's dilemma in balancing rising inflation with a sharp slowdown in job growth, though a quarter-point rate cut at the upcoming meeting remains highly probable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the tax-free cash ISA allowance in the upcoming Budget, arguing that such a move is unlikely to effectively foster a broader investment culture. Reeves is reportedly considering reducing the allowance from £20,000 to £10,000 as a measure to encourage people to invest more in stocks and shares, amidst a projected £22 billion budget shortfall. The article highlights that cash ISAs are the most widely used type of ISA, holding a substantial £360 billion across the country. The committee firmly believes that now is not the appropriate time for such a cut, emphasizing the need for comprehensive policy changes rather than isolated adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing a significant shift towards automatic cars, which now constitute one in three vehicles on the roads, largely driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. This trend presents a dilemma for new drivers: while passing a manual test offers the freedom to drive any car, automatic might seem quicker, despite a lower pass rate. The article highlights practical challenges such as the scarcity of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs. For some individuals with disabilities, automatic cars offer greater accessibility, and while a stigma around automatic-only licenses persists, the growing prevalence of electric vehicles suggests this perception may eventually change.</p>

          <p>Counting of votes is officially underway in the Irish presidential election, a crucial process that will determine the 10th Irish president to succeed the current head of state, Michael D. Higgins. Voters in the Republic of Ireland had a choice between two main contenders, Catherine Connolly and Heather Humphreys, though Jim Gavin's name remained on the ballot despite his earlier withdrawal. Early unofficial indications suggest a potentially low turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. The article details the candidates' backgrounds and the meticulous process for tallying votes across the country's 43 constituencies, with a result expected later this evening.</p>

          <p>Magnesium, frequently hailed as a "miracle mineral" for its purported benefits in sleep, digestion, and mental health, is driving a booming supplement market now valued at nearly £3 billion globally. The article critically examines whether these supplements are truly necessary, noting that while magnesium is essential for over 300 different bodily processes, diagnosing a deficiency is challenging. Dietitians emphasize prioritizing dietary sources like seeds, nuts, and greens over supplements, as strong scientific evidence for their positive effect on healthy populations is limited. The article warns against excessive intake, which can lead to side effects like diarrhea, and highlights the serious risks for individuals with kidney disease, advising caution and professional consultation.</p>
