          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston experienced a bird strike shortly after taking off from Miami International Airport, forcing it to return for an emergency landing. The airline reported that one of the aircraft's engines was impacted by the birds. Fortunately, the plane landed safely, and no injuries were reported among the passengers or crew. After the incident, the flight was able to depart again, arriving in Boston approximately two hours behind its original schedule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's head coach, Brendon McCullum, anticipates a "short" and straightforward selection meeting for the upcoming Ashes cricket tour of Australia. He indicated that the core of the squad is largely settled, with the main point of discussion being the choice for the second spinner to support Shoaib Bashir. McCullum also confirmed that England will not take a specialist back-up wicketkeeper, as Ollie Pope can fill the role if needed, and suggested the touring party could include as many as seven specialist seam bowlers. The squad is expected to be officially announced in the week commencing September 22.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially terminated talks with the Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise subsidiary, Argos. The decision was made after JD.com reportedly sought to engage on a "materially revised set of terms," which Sainsbury's concluded was not in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the collapse of the potential deal, Sainsbury's stated that it remains confident in its financial outlook, reaffirming its expectation to deliver an underlying operating profit of around £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has claimed the men's 100-meter title at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, becoming the first Jamaican man to win a global 100m final since Usain Bolt in 2016. Seville's victory, achieved with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds, signals a potential resurgence for Jamaican men's sprinting on the world stage. The win was particularly significant as it was witnessed by Bolt himself, whose former coach, Glen Mills, now mentors Seville. The Jamaican team celebrated a one-two finish, with Kishane Thompson taking the silver medal, solidifying their renewed dominance in the event.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley is reportedly building a diverse investment portfolio with his NFL earnings, focusing on tech startups and venture capital funds. Following the "Marshawn Lynch method," Barkley aims to live off his endorsement deals while investing his salary to create long-term wealth. His reported investments include stakes in AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, often in amounts between $250,000 and $500,000 per startup. This strategy reflects a growing trend among professional athletes to leverage their high earnings for financial security beyond their relatively short playing careers.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the UK's Labour Party, emphasizing the need for unity to secure a second term in government. In a speech in Sunderland, she positioned herself as the candidate to bring the party together and effectively challenge the rival Reform UK party. Phillipson is competing against her former cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the position, which was vacated by Angela Rayner following her resignation over tax affairs. The contest is viewed by some as a test of the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations from his government.</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC has maintained its perfect start to the Premier League season, securing all four of its wins with goals scored late in the matches, a phenomenon being dubbed "Arne Time" after manager Arne Slot. The latest instance came against Burnley, where a Mohamed Salah penalty in the final seconds of stoppage time clinched a victory. This pattern of late winners has become a hallmark of the team's current campaign, creating a psychological advantage over opponents and demonstrating the squad's resilience and winning mentality. The team's ability to secure points even when not playing at their best is seen as an ominous sign for their title challengers.</p>

          <p>This article explores the modern theme park industry, using the opening of Universal's new $7 billion Epic Universe as a case study for how these destinations engineer overwhelming and immersive fun. To compete with the endless entertainment available on smartphones, parks are creating meticulously detailed worlds and physically intense rides that push the limits of the human body. From strategically placed landmarks that guide crowds to managing hours-long queues with in-line bathrooms, every aspect of the visitor experience is micromanaged. The goal is to create a perfect, if artificial, reality that provides a powerful, if expensive, escape from the real world.</p>
