        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has initiated a share buyback program for its employees, setting a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its $40 billion valuation during a 2022 funding round, although it is slightly up from a previously reported internal markdown. The move provides liquidity for staff, a common practice for startups remaining private longer. Despite the valuation change, the company reports strong performance, projecting over 30% core net revenue growth and $300 billion in annual e-commerce payment volume.</p>

          <p>Analysis from shipping consultancy Sea Intelligence indicates that carriers are already reducing the use of Chinese-built vessels on transpacific routes to North America. This preemptive shift comes in anticipation of a new US port service fee targeting such ships. The data shows a noticeable downward trend in the deployment of these vessels on both the Asia-North America west and east coast trade lanes. In response, major carriers like Cosco Shipping Lines have affirmed their commitment to maintaining stable service to the US market despite the potential operational challenges.

          <p>High-level officials from the United States and China have agreed to increase communication channels to better manage their strategic differences following a meeting in New York. The discussions were described as "candid, in-depth and constructive," covering key issues including the one-China policy regarding Taiwan. Both sides agreed on the importance of maintaining dialogue to prevent misunderstandings and expand areas of cooperation. The meeting is seen as a preparatory step ahead of a potential summit between Presidents Trump and Xi.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, analysis suggests that the outcome between Team Europe and Team USA will hinge on several critical factors, including a strong start in the opening foursomes. Historically, the team that dominates the first day's alternate-shot format has gone on to win the last five competitions. Managing the famously boisterous New York crowd will also be crucial for the European visitors, who aim to win on US soil for the first time since 2012. Europe enters with a significant advantage in player experience, though the US team is favored slightly by bookmakers.</p>

          <p>During a farewell meeting for Beijing's outgoing envoy, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that maritime disputes should not define the entire relationship between the two countries. He called for continued focus on trade, cultural exchange, and people-to-people interactions to strengthen bilateral ties. The Chinese embassy echoed this sentiment, expressing hope that relations can be put back on a positive track. This language mirrors a joint statement from 2023, where both nations agreed that maritime issues are only one component of their much broader relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy company BP, which was considered a prime takeover target earlier this year, has seen its stock price climb over 32% since April, outperforming many rivals. This improved market sentiment has quieted speculation about potential acquisitions by competitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil. The turnaround is attributed to a new strategic direction, a leadership change, successful cost-cutting measures, and a series of recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth to drive shareholder value.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent podcast, former Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney shared several amusing and strange anecdotes from his experiences playing in away dressing rooms. He recalled some venues manipulating temperatures, with Chelsea's being excessively hot and Liverpool's being freezing cold. One of the most bizarre incidents occurred at Sunderland, where leaking toilets from the floor above flooded the dressing room, soiling players' clothes. Rooney also recounted how firework displays outside team hotels, and even on the roof, would often disrupt the players' sleep before important matches.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the viral Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased with the recent crash in the secondary market for its products. After some editions saw resale prices surge over 2,000% above retail, the company significantly increased production to meet demand and counter scalpers. Pop Mart now produces around 30 million plush toys monthly, a tenfold increase from last year. The company's strategy aims to make its art accessible to genuine fans and build a sustainable long-term brand, rather than fueling a speculative bubble that alienates its core customers.</p>

          <p>China has launched an international operations center in Shanghai dedicated to advancing the cross-border use of its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY. The People's Bank of China aims to provide an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system by improving the efficiency of international transactions with the digital yuan. The initiative includes three new platforms: one for cross-border digital payments, a blockchain service platform for on-chain transactions, and a digital asset platform to help existing financial infrastructure integrate with blockchain technology. This marks a significant step in China's efforts to internationalize its currency.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-20 in a dramatic finish on Thursday night. Kicker Jason Myers converted a 52-yard field goal as time expired to clinch the win, making amends for a missed attempt just minutes earlier. The Seahawks had built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but a late surge from Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, including a game-tying touchdown pass with 33 seconds left, set up the tense finale. The victory marks Seattle's eighth consecutive win over their NFC West division rivals.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated he is prepared to leave office once the war with Russia is over. He stated that his primary objective is to end the conflict and that seeking another term is not his personal goal. Zelenskyy also committed to holding elections in Ukraine if a ceasefire agreement is reached with Russia, which would be a significant development as elections are currently suspended under martial law. His five-year term officially would have ended in May 2024 had the full-scale invasion not occurred.</p>
