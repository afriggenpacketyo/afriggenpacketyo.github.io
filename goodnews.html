          <p>Journalism, after a second-place finish in the Kentucky Derby, secured a comeback win at the 150th Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, marking trainer Michael McCarthy's second Preakness victory and jockey Umberto Rispoli's first Triple Crown race win. The race, held at Pimlico Race Course, saw Journalism overtake Gosger in the final stretch, with Sandman finishing third. Notably, Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty did not participate, focusing instead on the Belmont Stakes, setting up a potential rematch with Journalism. This Preakness was the last to be held at Pimlico before its demolition and reconstruction, with the race moving to Laurel Park next year. </p>
