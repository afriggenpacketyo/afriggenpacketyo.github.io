          <p>Milwaukee Bucks' Damian Lillard responded playfully to teammate Kyle Kuzma's boxing challenge on social media. Kuzma initially joked about Giannis Antetokounmpo's potential departure, followed by a boxing challenge to Lillard. Lillard, recovering from Achilles surgery, referenced Bernard Hopkins' fight against Oscar De La Hoya in his response. Lillard's response was a lighthearted jab, referencing a famous boxing match to deflect Kuzma's challenge while he recovers from injury. </p>

Coach McCullum sees Smith as an ideal white-ball opener, praising his ability to put bowlers under pressure. Smith's performance in a recent ODI showcased his effectiveness, scoring rapidly against good-length deliveries. </p>
