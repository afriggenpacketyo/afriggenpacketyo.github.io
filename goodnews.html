          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 17:49:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising costs of rolling over existing debt amidst high interest rates. The ratings agency noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. This downgrade is expected to marginally increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively impact sentiment toward U.S. assets. The U.S. is currently running a massive budget deficit, with interest costs continuing to rise. Optimism score is 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on states, particularly those led by Democrats, that provide state-funded benefits to undocumented immigrants. This includes actions like targeting state laws offering in-state tuition to undocumented students and investigating programs providing assistance to impoverished immigrants. The administration is also pushing for a reconciliation bill that would penalize states using their own funds for undocumented immigrants' healthcare, potentially costing states billions. This has created a split among Democrats, with some arguing for continued support for undocumented immigrants while others are retrenching due to budget constraints and political pressures.

          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation has revealed that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged for items marked as being on sale due to price tag errors. The investigation found expired discount tags on everyday products, leading to customers paying more than the advertised price. While Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors are minimal compared to the volume of transactions, the report highlights a broader issue of pricing inaccuracies at retail stores. Several complaints and class-action lawsuits have been filed against Kroger over similar pricing errors. Optimism score is 70.</p>

Experts believe that 2024 likely set a record for the steepest fall in the murder rate, and 2025 is off to an even better start. Data from the Real-Time Crime Index shows that through March, murder is down 21.6 percent, violent crime is down 11 percent, and property crime is down 13.8 percent. The Brookings Institution suggests that the pandemic itself was a primary factor in the 2020 rise, with unemployment and school closures contributing to increased crime. Optimism score is 85.</p>
