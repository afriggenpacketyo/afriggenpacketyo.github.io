          <p>The winning numbers for the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the game's second-largest prize ever, have been announced as 11, 23, 44, 61, 62 with a Powerball of 17. The jackpot had an estimated cash value of $826.4 million, though it was not immediately known if any winning tickets were sold in Saturday's drawing. This massive prize accumulated after no winners claimed the previous $1.4 billion grand prize, making it one of only six jackpots exceeding $1 billion in Powerball's 33-year history. Powerball officials encourage responsible play, emphasizing that every $2 ticket helps support good causes within communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch and propel millimetre-scale robots by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. The technique involves precisely heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets on the surface to boil and trigger the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles grow to a certain point, they suddenly collapse, releasing a strong force that can launch the small jumpers 1.5 meters into the air. By controlling the light flow, scientists can direct these launches and even enable the tiny pieces of material to swim in water, demonstrating an efficient new mechanism for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to claim her second consecutive championship at Flushing Meadows. This win marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam trophy, all achieved on hard courts, and establishes her as the first woman since Serena Williams (2012-14) to earn back-to-back titles at this event. After experiencing losses in two major finals earlier in 2025, Sabalenka attributed her success to a newfound ability to maintain emotional composure under pressure. Anisimova, despite strong crowd support and powerful play, ultimately could not overcome Sabalenka's consistent level.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S., including Yonkers Middle High School in New York, are implementing Yondr magnetic pouches as a solution to enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. These pouches, which students carry but can only unlock at designated stations using magnets, aim to reduce distractions and foster improved in-person engagement. While some students and educators have welcomed the change, reporting more conversations and a "positive loud" atmosphere, others remain skeptical or are actively seeking ways to bypass the restrictions. The cost of these pouches, approximately $25-30 per student, has also sparked debate regarding school budget allocations, yet proponents believe they create a more focused learning environment.</p>

This diplomatic signaling aims to underscore China's growing influence and offer an alternative to a US-centric international system, particularly at a time when US credibility and diplomatic norms are perceived to be disrupted by President Donald Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball gifts and an unforgettable experience from both the Phillies and Marlins organizations after an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him. The incident, which went viral, showed the ball landing near the boy and his father, only for a woman to aggressively claim it. Following the dispute, a Marlins staffer promptly gave the boy a gift bag, and later, Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who hit the home run, personally met the young fan and presented him with an autographed baseball bat. These gestures aimed to rectify the disappointing experience and create a positive memory for the child.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to broaden its public profile beyond its leader, Nigel Farage, by promoting new candidates and aiming for significant electoral growth in upcoming local and parliamentary elections. The party, which has recently seen a surge in national opinion polls, is keen to shed its "one-man-band" image by showcasing hopefuls such as Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson. While the party aims for a rigorous selection process to vet the 5,000 candidates it needs, it faces the challenge of rapid expansion while simultaneously ensuring proper vetting to avoid past scandals and build a robust, diverse leadership.</p>

          <p>Davey Johnson, a revered figure in Major League Baseball, has passed away at the age of 82. A four-time MLB All-Star infielder, Johnson was a vital member of the Baltimore Orioles, contributing to their two World Series titles in 1966 and 1970. He later transitioned to a highly successful managerial career, most notably leading the 1986 New York Mets to a memorable World Series championship. Johnson's 595-417 record remains the best of any manager in Mets franchise history, and he also managed the Cincinnati Reds, Orioles, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Washington Nationals, leaving an indelible mark on the sport.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former British Army officer who served in dangerous front-line roles in Iraq and Afghanistan, is advocating for greater recognition and support for women in the military. She co-founded "Sisters in Service," a community interest company, to help female veterans, particularly those now working in healthcare, connect and support each other. Dr. Bennett emphasizes that many people hold an "outdated idea" that only men deploy to the front line, which leads to isolation and misconceptions for women veterans. The group provides a "cathartic" space for shared experiences, aiming to break down the barriers that prevent women from seeking necessary help and acknowledging their significant contributions.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively deploying full-scale decoys, including inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery models, to effectively deceive Russian forces and compel them to waste valuable ammunition. These sophisticated imitations, which range from British-made M777 howitzers to drones, are designed to mimic real military equipment visually, thermally, and on radar. Volunteers play a crucial role in supplying these cost-effective decoys; for example, plywood M777 models costing around $500-600 have successfully drawn expensive Lancet kamikaze drones. Proper deployment, which includes meticulously recreating realistic positions with wheel ruts and ammunition crates, significantly enhances their effectiveness in misleading enemy intelligence and conserving genuine military resources.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Known affectionately as "God's influencer," Acutis, who tragically died at just 15 from leukemia, utilized his love for technology to create websites documenting miracles and spread Catholic teachings. His canonization, which was notably fast-tracked by the Vatican, aims to energize and inspire faith in young people globally. Carlo was baptized in London before his family moved to Milan, where he spent the rest of his life, making him a remarkably relatable figure for many young Catholics today. His body is now preserved in wax in Assisi, serving as a popular pilgrimage site.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour has stepped down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, transitioning to the role of global editorial director, with Chloe Malle taking over as head of editorial content. Wintour, renowned for her instinctive understanding of the zeitgeist and for broadening Vogue's cover subjects to include pop stars and politicians, has been instrumental in maintaining the magazine's relevance for nearly 40 years. Her partial departure sparks debate on whether the print magazine, increasingly seen as a "relic" in the fast-paced digital world, can retain its significant clout without her singular influence. Malle reportedly plans to focus on less frequent, themed issues, aiming to make Vogue a collectible item in a challenging and increasingly corporate media landscape.</p>

His presence in the UK has naturally fueled speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, who will also be in the country.

          <p>The European Union's new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) is set to be gradually introduced this autumn, beginning October 12, aiming to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. This system will replace the current manual passport stamping, requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at automated kiosks or with border officers upon their initial use. Concerns have been widely raised about potential long queues and disruptions, particularly at high-traffic points like the port of Dover and Eurostar terminals, prompting a phased implementation strategy over six months. Once registered, the information will be valid for three years, with details verified on each subsequent trip.</p>

His unbeaten 71 runs came off only 26 balls, a crucial effort after joining the crease with Somerset needing 11 runs per over. Despite the Bears posting a strong total of 190-6, led by skipper Alex Davies, Dickson's late fireworks ensured Somerset's progression to the semi-final against Lancashire.</p>
