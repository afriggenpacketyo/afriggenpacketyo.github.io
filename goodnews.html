          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to lift some economic sanctions on Syria, following a promise made during a trip to the Middle East. This move aims to support Syria's new transitional government, which has been advocating for sanctions relief to aid in reconstruction and stabilize the economy after the Assad regime's collapse. The Treasury Department has already issued guidance to encourage new investment in the country. The policy shift aligns with requests from regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who are seeking to normalize relations with Syria's new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

While both products have similar rates now, experts note key differences for borrowers to consider. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially cheaper if the Fed cuts rates later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates based on mortgage bond markets, offering stability but less potential for a near-term rate drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German companies are increasingly turning to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components, aiming to reduce strategic dependence on China. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, reflecting a broader European effort to build "non-red" supply chains independent of Chinese influence. This shift is driven by security concerns over data leaks and China's ties to Russia. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying key components like software and chips, an area where Taiwan's advanced tech sector offers a significant advantage.</p>
