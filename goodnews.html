          <p>Home improvement retailer Lowe's reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by increased demand for home projects. The company also announced a significant strategic move to attract more professional contractors by acquiring Foundation Building Materials, a major distributor of interior building products, for approximately $8.8 billion. Following the acquisition, Lowe's updated its full-year sales forecast to a range of $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion. The positive report contrasts with rival Home Depot, which recently missed its quarterly sales and earnings targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new data analysis from UCLA's Williams Institute estimates that over 2.8 million people in the United States, or 1% of the population aged 13 and older, now identify as transgender. This figure includes approximately 724,000 youth aged 13 to 17, who identify as trans at a significantly higher rate (3.3%) than older adults. The research, based on federal and state health surveys, provides a detailed demographic portrait of the trans population across all 50 states. Researchers warn that this may be the last such study for years, as the Trump administration is actively removing gender identity questions from vital federal surveys.</p>

          <p>In Washington D.C., the NWSL's Washington Spirit is experiencing a surge in popularity and fan engagement, starkly contrasting with the decline of the city's original MLS dynasty, DC United. The Spirit, under new ambitious ownership, has invested heavily in the team, connected with the community, and achieved on-field success, including a championship in 2021. Meanwhile, DC United has been mired in mediocrity for years, leading to fan disillusionment and chants of "sell the team." This dynamic highlights a broader trend of growing interest in women's professional soccer, with the Spirit potentially surpassing their male counterparts in local relevance.</p>

          <h2>Proposal Suggests Converting Vacant Downtown L.A. Office Towers into Affordable Co-Living Spaces</h2>

          <p>To address Los Angeles's dual crises of a severe housing shortage and high office vacancy rates, a new proposal advocates for converting empty downtown skyscrapers into affordable co-living spaces. This alternative to traditional apartment conversions would be more cost-effective, as it keeps shared kitchens and bathrooms in the building's core, avoiding expensive plumbing retrofits. The model involves small, private studio rooms with shared amenities, potentially offering units for around $1,000 per month. Proponents argue this could provide a crucial housing solution for students, service workers, and others struggling with affordability, while revitalizing the downtown area.</p>

          <h2>Seventy Years Later, Nabokov's 'Lolita' Continues to Fuel Cultural Debates on Art, Morality, and Interpretation</h2>

          <p>Marking its 70th anniversary, Vladimir Nabokov's novel "Lolita" remains a cultural touchstone, with its interpretation evolving significantly over the decades. Initially read by many as a scandalous but allegorical story of forbidden love, contemporary readings, influenced by the Me Too movement, now predominantly view it as a harrowing story of child sexual assault. The article explores how the novel acts as a barometer for cultural shifts, reflecting changing attitudes toward abuse, consent, and the moral responsibilities of art. Despite persistent arguments over its meaning, the book's complex prose and unreliable narrator ensure it continues to challenge and provoke readers.</p>
