          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will continue as chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, aims to reassure investors amidst disappointing earnings due to insurance losses from wildfires and concerns about tariffs. Buffett, 94, will still assist with major acquisition opportunities, while Abel, 62, will oversee company operations and capital deployment. This succession plan provides stability as Berkshire Hathaway manages its substantial cash reserves in potentially volatile markets.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline after OPEC+ countries agreed to increase production in June, adding 411,000 barrels per day to the market. This decision, following a similar production surge in May, has raised concerns about an oversupplied market amidst fears of a recession triggered by U.S. tariffs. Service firms like Baker Hughes anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment, and oil majors Chevron and Exxon have reported lower earnings compared to the previous year. Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. crude and Brent prices to average $59 and $63 per barrel this year.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Wally Lamb's novel, "The River Is Waiting," which follows a stay-at-home dad who is imprisoned for involuntary manslaughter after a tragic accident. The review critiques the protagonist's self-centeredness and the clich√©d portrayal of prison life. The reviewer finds that while the novel attempts to explore themes of guilt and redemption, it falls short due to a lack of authentic emotional depth and a satisfying resolution. The reviewer notes that Lamb has great sympathy for his character's plights, yet much of what occurs feels cliched, as does much of the language and dialogue.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxing star Naoya "Monster" Inoue retained his undisputed super bantamweight world championship by defeating Ramon Cardenas via an eighth-round technical knockout. Despite an early knockdown by Cardenas, Inoue rallied to dominate the fight, displaying his power and ruthlessness. The victory marks Inoue's triumphant return to the United States, and he plans to fight WBA interim super bantamweight champion Murodjon Akhmadaliev in Japan in September.

          <p>Jack Draper, a British men's number one tennis player, has shown significant progress on clay courts, reaching the final at the Madrid Open. His success marks a turning point after previous struggles on the surface, including a first-round defeat at the French Open. Draper's improved physical conditioning, aided by a new physio and fitness trainer, has been key to his success. Former British number one Tim Henman believes Draper's attributes are well-suited for clay, and Draper himself has gained greater belief in his body.</p>

          <p>Learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, as neuroscientists say people who speak multiple languages process information differently than those who speak one language. Learning a new language is like working out your brain. As muscles get stronger with physical training, neural pathways in the brain reshape when you learn a new language. The Broca's area located in the frontal lobe is primarily responsible for syntax and helps construct grammatically correct sentences and understand sentence structure. Learning languages as a child is an advantage as children's brains are more adaptable to neural plasticity and learning.</p>
