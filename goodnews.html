          <p>DNA tests have confirmed a 48-year-old man is the 140th "stolen grandchild" identified by the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo activist group in Argentina. He was born in a clandestine detention center in 1977 after his parents, left-wing activists, were "disappeared" by the military dictatorship. His older sister, who has been searching for him, expressed immense joy at the discovery. The case highlights the ongoing struggle for justice and identity for the estimated 500 infants stolen during the regime's "dirty war."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings about the economy. This anxiety is fueling a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," as consumers look to build emergency funds amid uncertainty. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive these habits, instead recommending intentional strategies. They suggest taking a "money temperature" to assess finances, using "reverse budgeting" to prioritize savings, and automating contributions to appropriate accounts to build wealth systematically.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a significant rally, CNBC's Jim Cramer believes GE Vernova's stock has more room to grow, countering institutional investors who may be selling due to tariff concerns. He highlighted a BMO Capital report that raised its price target, emphasizing the company's nearly $80 billion in service-related revenue, which is insulated from turbine equipment demand. Cramer suggests that the company could see more international orders amid trade negotiations and that new legislative changes could incentivize U.S. production expansion, making the stock's outlook favorable.

          <p>The team bus for the Wales women's national football team was involved in a traffic accident in Switzerland while en route to a training session for their Euro 2025 match against France. The Football Association of Wales confirmed that all players and staff on the bus were uninjured. However, the driver of the other vehicle involved was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. As a result of the crash, the team's scheduled training session at the stadium was canceled, though they trained later at their team base.</p>

          <p>A new provision in a recently signed budget bill establishes "Trump accounts," a government-seeded investment vehicle for children. For U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028, the government will deposit an initial $1,000 into these accounts, which parents can then contribute to annually. The funds grow tax-deferred but are taxed as regular income upon withdrawal after age 18, with some exceptions for education and home purchases. While experts note it's "free money," they also suggest that existing options like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer better tax advantages for specific goals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top White House economic advisor has dismissed concerns that the administration's new tariffs will lead to significant price increases for consumers. Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, compared the likelihood of tariff-driven inflation to rare events like "pandemics or meteors," stating there is no evidence of it happening so far. He pointed to a report showing that prices of imported goods fell between December and May. However, many economists argue that price hikes are still expected, citing implementation delays and corporate stockpiling as reasons for the current stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka fought back from the brink of a major upset to secure her place in the Wimbledon semi-finals. She defeated 37-year-old German veteran Laura Siegemund in a grueling three-set match, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. Siegemund's unconventional style, featuring slices and drop shots, frustrated the heavy favorite, who had to come from a break down twice in the final set. Sabalenka's grit and improved on-court composure were key to her survival in the nearly three-hour contest on Centre Court.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, conspiracy theories blaming the disaster on "cloud seeding" have circulated on social media, amplified by some political figures. However, meteorological experts have unequivocally debunked these claims as false. Scientists explain that cloud seeding cannot create massive storm systems and that any particles from recent operations would have dispersed long before the storm. The article clarifies that the flooding was caused by a convergence of natural weather phenomena and that such extreme rainfall events are expected to become more common due to climate change.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to his first-ever Wimbledon semi-final after a four-set victory over Karen Khachanov. The fifth seed dominated the first two sets before experiencing a sudden dip in the third, which he lost 1-6. Despite falling a break behind early in the fourth set and a brief malfunction of the electronic line-calling system, Fritz regained his composure. He played a nearly perfect tie-break to close out the match 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(4), setting up a clash with Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for two of the Taliban's most senior leaders, Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court found "reasonable grounds" to believe they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution through their systematic and severe restrictions on the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has barred girls from secondary education and women from most jobs. The warrants are a significant step in holding the regime accountable for what the UN has termed "gender apartheid."</p>

Sunak, who worked at the bank in the early 2000s before entering politics, will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical matters. His appointment was delayed by a government watchdog for one year after he left office due to risks of unfair access and influence. Sunak, who remains a member of parliament, has stated that his pay from the role will be donated to his numeracy charity.</p>
