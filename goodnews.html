          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for conflict in relationships, with tone of voice or attitude topping the list due to signaling contempt. Family relations often lead to arguments stemming from misalignments and unmet needs, while household chores become a source of tension due to the uneven distribution of labor and the "invisible load." Communication styles also contribute to conflicts, with ineffective engagement or hostility exacerbating initial issues. The article offers strategies for navigating these conflicts, such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, redistributing tasks, and using the "five-second rule" to prevent escalation.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students and faculty at Pomona College are advocating for reduced technology use on campus, reacting to the pervasiveness of technology and its perceived detrimental effects on academic and social life. Students are seeking more classes where electronic devices are banned, forming a "Luddite Club" for tech-free hangouts, and switching to flip phones. Some professors are limiting or banning electronic devices in their classes and curtailing student use of ChatGPT. The movement aims to reclaim the closely knit community and in-person learning experience that defines small residential liberal-arts colleges.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has put forward the country's "four core principles" as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea, while blaming regional tensions on external actors. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving positive outcomes through cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces. China formally presented its blueprint for cooperation in 2002 through an agreement with Asean, but its expansive claims are contested by several member states. Face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels have become more frequent since 2023.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that President Trump's policies have diminished the threat of "peaceful evolution" for China, a long-standing concern about American conspiracies aimed at subverting the Communist Party. The author notes that the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing others on governance, while China has emerged as a major economic and political power. This shift has altered the dynamics of the ideological Cold War, reducing the perceived threat of American influence.</p>

          <p>Arthur Sze's poem "Under a Supermoon" explores themes of reflection, perseverance, and the beauty of minutiae in life. The poem contrasts grand desires, such as twirling in space or plunging into the Mariana Trench, with the simple joys of everyday experiences. It celebrates the richness of sensory details, like the smell of split pi√±on and juniper, and recalls Blake's wisdom about fools becoming wise through persistence. The speaker finds solace in the darkening craters of the moon, the scent of apples, and the realization that life contains both explosions and the birthing of stars within it.</p>
