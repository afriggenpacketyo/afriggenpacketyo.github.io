        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to prevent employees from reporting workplace sexual misconduct or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void confidentiality clauses used to conceal such allegations, a practice highlighted by cases involving Harvey Weinstein and Mohamed Al Fayed. Campaigners have lauded the move as a significant step toward protecting victims and addressing power imbalances. The legal change aims to align the UK with countries like Ireland and the US, which have already implemented similar prohibitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has put forward a draft bill that would allow the government to reinstate military conscription during a national defense emergency. The plan is a compromise, designed to rapidly expand the armed forces in response to the changed security landscape in Europe, particularly Russian aggression. The bill aims to make voluntary service more attractive with higher pay, hoping to double the number of reservists to 200,000. This move comes as Germany seeks to meet new NATO troop requirements, which call for a total of 460,000 soldiers in a conflict scenario.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million deal with Nottingham Forest to acquire Swedish winger Anthony Elanga. The 23-year-old is being brought in to bolster Newcastle's attacking capabilities as the team prepares for its return to the Champions League. Elanga had a successful 2024-25 season, contributing six goals and eleven assists for Nottingham Forest. The transfer represents a significant profit for Forest, who originally signed the player from Manchester United for £15 million in 2023, where he had progressed through the youth academy.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense, an unexpected contender, is set to face Chelsea in the Club World Cup semi-finals. Led by charismatic manager Renato Gaúcho, the team has defied expectations, relying on tactical defensive solidity and the veteran leadership of 40-year-old defender Thiago Silva. Silva, a former Chelsea star, has been instrumental both on and off the pitch, delivering rousing team talks and demonstrating impressive tactical acumen. Despite being the underdog against the financially powerful English club, Fluminense's disciplined performance and key players have given them a credible chance to advance to the final.</p>

          <p>Recent export controls on rare earths by Beijing are accelerating international efforts to diversify the supply chain for these critical minerals. China has long dominated the market, but new projects are emerging globally to reduce this dependency. An Australian-listed company has begun exploration in Brazil, while U.S. firms have partnered with Kazakhstan's national geological company to develop a rare earth project there. These moves reflect a growing pushback against China's control over materials essential for many modern technologies, though analysts note that Beijing still holds a very strong position in the sector.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels defeated the Texas Rangers 6-5 after Nolan Schanuel drew a bases-loaded, walk-off walk in the bottom of the ninth inning. Veteran catcher Travis d’Arnaud played a key role in the victory, hitting a two-run home run against his former battery mate, Jacob deGrom. D'Arnaud later hit a crucial game-tying double in the sixth inning, setting the stage for the late-game heroics. The win was a much-needed boost for the Angels, who had previously suffered three consecutive one-run losses, and it showcased the team's resilience in a tight divisional matchup.</p>

This new drug, developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, addresses a critical treatment gap for the most vulnerable population.

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices have recently formed a "golden cross," a technical chart pattern where the 50-day moving average rises above the 200-day moving average. This event, also observed in the MSCI World Index for the first time since January 2023, is often interpreted by analysts as a signal of a potential long-term bull market. Historical data suggests that this pattern has frequently preceded periods of significant market gains, with the S&P 500 rising in the following year 88% of the time since 1975.

          <p>Singapore is emerging as an increasingly popular destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Some Chinese students currently in the U.S. cite difficulties adjusting to cultural differences and parental safety concerns as reasons for considering a move to Singapore for postgraduate studies. The island nation's cultural similarities, safe environment, and economic openness are significant draws. Industry insiders predict that Singapore's universities may see a rise in applications from China due to the growing uncertainty and instability perceived in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) appears to be phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. Sources confirmed the change, which has been observed at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, with reports of the same policy at LAX and LaGuardia. The rule, which does not affect TSA PreCheck members, was officially implemented nationwide in 2006 following the failed 2001 "shoe bomber" attempt. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently amend a rule to protect tenants from "renovictions," where landlords evict residents under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The new ordinance will prevent landlords from using a remodel as a "just cause" for eviction unless they have an official order from a government agency to vacate the unit for safety reasons. The city is also developing rules to require landlords to provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate renovations, ensuring they can return to their original unit afterward.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa in an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector. The move has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings, particularly from European countries included in the new policy. While most visitors are still domestic tourists, tour guides are preparing for a larger influx of international travelers. The policy notably excludes major African nations and offers a more restrictive transit option for citizens of the US, UK, and Canada.</p>
