          <p>Bath & Body Works has named Daniel Heaf as its new CEO, succeeding Gina Boswell, effective immediately. Heaf, previously Nike's chief strategy and transformation officer, joins the company as it seeks to accelerate growth, resonate with younger demographics, and expand internationally.

          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year due to concerns about rising inflation. Bostic noted that tariffs have been larger than expected and are influencing inflation expectations.

Bostic, who is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, acknowledged that even reduced tariffs are economically significant.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the current price of gold, noting it was $3,175.87 per ounce as of May 16, 2025, and explains the various factors that influence its fluctuation. These factors include supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, making it an attractive investment during times of economic uncertainty.

          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to fall by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This decrease, nearly 7%, would result in a typical annual bill of ¬£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. While a positive development, analysts caution that prices remain significantly above pre-decade levels, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability. The Energy Saving Trust emphasizes the need for government policy action to upgrade homes and reduce energy bills on a larger scale.</p>

It highlights examples such as the memorial of Sir John Finch and Sir Thomas Baines, Renaissance-era doctors who lived and worked together, and the writings of Michel de Montaigne on his friendship with √âtienne de La Bo√©tie. The article further discusses how societal views shifted, elevating women's friendships in the 18th and 19th centuries while simultaneously fostering self-consciousness around male intimacy, influencing modern expectations and expressions of friendship.</p>
