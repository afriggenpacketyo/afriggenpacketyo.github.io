          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life after multiple fires at properties connected to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The incidents include a fire at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, a small fire at a property in Islington where he lived in the 1990s, and a car fire on the same street as the Kentish Town home. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to Starmer's high profile, and they are treating the fires as suspicious, conducting house-to-house inquiries and reviewing footage to gather more information. The fires caused damage to the properties but no injuries were reported. Optimism score of 60.</p>

His exoneration came about due to DNA evidence, which was not available during his initial appeal in 2008. The Crown Prosecution Service did not contest the appeal, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) will feel it has clawed back some respect after the battering it has received over its catastrophic mishandling of the Andy Malkinson case.

          <p>Bernalillo County sheriff's deputies in New Mexico used a drone to de-escalate a standoff with two young boys holding a loaded handgun. The drone provided a key vantage point, allowing deputies to communicate with the 9-year-old and 7-year-old boys. After talking to the boys for about five minutes, deputies fired a non-lethal projectile and moved in to grab the gun. Sheriff John Allen credited the drone program for preventing a potentially deadly force confrontation, noting the department has responded to the home over 50 times due to domestic violence issues. Optimism score of 60.</p>

          <p>Hay fever season has started early and is particularly severe in 2025, affecting millions in the UK. Unusually high pollen counts, triggered by a mix of perfect spring weather and an intense birch pollen spike, have caused symptoms to appear weeks ahead of schedule. Grass pollen is now on the rise, meaning symptoms will likely persist over the coming weeks. Experts advise reducing exposure by monitoring pollen forecasts, wearing protective gear, and modifying washing routines. Optimism score of 65.</p>
