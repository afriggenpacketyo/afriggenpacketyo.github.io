          <p>Automaker Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, which is a major local employer with 1,300 jobs. The urgent meeting was called after reports suggested that Lotus's Chinese owner, Geely, was exploring moving production to the United States to circumvent tariffs. The company, which had paused production due to the tariffs, insists that the UK remains the heart of its brand and is preparing to resume operations as the duties are reduced.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new strategy to tackle obesity by partnering with supermarkets and food manufacturers to make healthy options more appealing to consumers. Rather than imposing mandatory regulations, the plan relies on voluntary collaboration, which could involve promotions on healthy food, changes to loyalty programs, or different in-store layouts. This approach is part of a wider 10-year plan for the NHS and aims to improve public health by making healthier eating more accessible and affordable.</p>

          <p>A psychologist suggests that couples can gauge their relationship health by asking themselves four critical questions about their dynamic. These questions explore whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, maintain genuine curiosity about each other, and consistently take accountability for their mistakes. According to the article, answering "no" to these questions can be a strong indicator of underlying unhappiness, even if it hasn't been consciously acknowledged by the individuals involved.</p>

          <p>An essay posits that while statistics show Gen Z is having less sex, they are actually leading a new sexual revolution by fundamentally challenging its political and social definitions. The piece contrasts the "hookup culture" panic that surrounded millennials with the current "sex recession" narrative about Gen Z. It argues that this generation, shaped by the post-Roe era and online activism, is more focused on redefining concepts of sex, consent, and gender than any before it, infusing their personal lives with political meaning.</p>

To identify the right fit, Jain assesses how candidates describe solving past problems, looking for a detailed understanding of the process and a genuine enthusiasm for all aspects of the work.</p>
