          <p>As schools resume, parent WhatsApp groups are reigniting discussions about their utility and drawbacks. While some parents find them helpful for coordinating school events and sharing information, others, like Claire Berry, choose to leave due to competitive parenting, divisive policy debates, and overwhelming notifications. These groups can create unnecessary anxiety, polarize opinions, and disproportionately burden mothers with school administration. Experts suggest setting clear boundaries for engagement, recognizing that while useful for some, they can also become sources of stress and conflict for both parents and school staff.</p>

The 32-year-old recorded a long jump of 6.42m and expressed disappointment over a marginally fouled bigger leap. Fellow British athletes Keely Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell also progressed to the women's 800m final, aiming for a historic one-two finish.

          <p>Taiwan unveiled its most ambitious arms fair yet, highlighting two flagship projects that demonstrate its push for defense self-reliance and deepening cooperation with American firms. The Taipei Aerospace and Defense Technology Exhibition featured the island's first locally built anti-ballistic missile system, Chiang-Kong, designed to intercept enemy ballistic missiles at high altitudes. Additionally, a cruise missile co-developed with a US defense firm was showcased, signaling a dual strategy to deter Beijing's growing military pressure. This biennial event underscores Taiwan's efforts to expand its defense industry amid heightened cross-strait tensions.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, a significant political contest often seen as a bellwether for the current presidential administration's policies. Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger are the contenders, with Spanberger currently favored in some polls. National issues, particularly the Trump administration's federal workforce cuts, are central to the campaign, given Virginia's large federal employee population. Spanberger critiques the financial impact of Washington's policies, while Earle-Sears emphasizes job creation and ties herself to the popular term-limited Governor Youngkin.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, detained by the Taliban for nearly eight months, have been freed and emotionally reunited with their daughter in Qatar. The couple, who lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades running a charitable program, were stopped on February 1st, with the Taliban citing unspecified broken Afghan laws. Their release was secured through Qatari mediation, following months of public lobbying by their family who described harrowing conditions and deteriorating health during their detention. The family expressed immense gratitude and relief, looking forward to their parents' recovery and return to the UK.</p>

          <p>The High Seas Treaty, a global agreement aimed at protecting the world's oceans and reversing marine life damage, has achieved its 60th ratification by Morocco, ensuring it will become international law in January. This landmark deal, two decades in the making, will enable the creation of marine protected areas in international waters. Environmentalists commend this "monumental achievement" as proof of international cooperation for environmental protection. With nearly 10% of marine species at risk of extinction, the treaty commits nations to protect 30% of high seas by 2030, a crucial step for ocean health and global ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a 37-year-old principal executive of Amarvel Biotech in Wuhan, China, has been sentenced to 25 years in a US prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and his marketing manager, Yiyi Chen (sentenced to 15 years), were convicted of fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering. The US Justice Department stated that the company acted as a "pipeline of poison," disguising hundreds of kilos of precursors as everyday goods. This case marks the first time Chinese companies have been charged for directly trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals into the US, highlighting a direct effort to combat the opioid crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's suggestions that critical TV networks should lose their licenses and the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, questions arise about the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) power. The FCC, established in 1934, primarily regulates local TV and radio stations, not national networks directly, and sets rules for obscenity and decency. While it can influence mergers by denying license transfers, the FCC is legally barred from preventing specific viewpoints. Experts note that despite broad rules allowing significant leeway, enforcement of licensing regulations has decreased since the 1980s, though the theoretical power to rescind licenses remains.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a "productive" phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, stating they approved a deal for TikTok's US operations. Trump indicated the deal would involve a sale to US investors, with Oracle reportedly included, and the US maintaining "very tight control" over the app. However, Beijing's official state news agency, Xinhua, offered a less conclusive report, stating Xi "welcomes negotiations" and emphasizing adherence to Chinese laws. A ByteDance statement also cast doubt on a finalized deal, highlighting ongoing complexities regarding the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm and broader US-China tech tensions.</p>

Despite societal pressure to capitalize on his height in basketball, Wilmore, 24, realized his true calling was to help others. He is now training at a police academy in Kemah, Texas, where Chief Raymond Garivey is making accommodations for his unique stature, including finding a suitable uniform and patrol car. Wilmore's dedication to service is evident, as he states he would turn down an NBA offer to remain in Kemah, committed to the "thin blue line."</p>

The article critiques Trump's complaints about media bias and his administration's actions regarding healthcare and climate science, while also mocking the idea of unquestioning loyalty. It highlights the irony of Trump's "TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!" hats and suggests Kimmel should wear a "KIMMEL WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!" hat if he returns. The piece uses humor to comment on political discourse, free speech concerns, and the challenges of finding truth in a polarized environment.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a crucial testing ground for Chinese exporters pivoting their focus to Southeast Asia. Facing slowing demand in Western markets, many companies view the region's fast-growing economies and young consumer base as a significant opportunity for expansion. Li Wenqi, an electric scooter manufacturer, exemplifies this shift, noting the saturation of Western markets and geopolitical instability elsewhere. The annual event allows Chinese firms to court new buyers and establish a stronger presence in Southeast Asia, signaling a strategic reorientation in their global market ambitions.

          <p>A US federal judge dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the complaint "decidedly improper and impermissible." Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and filled with "tedious and burdensome" language unrelated to legal merits. The judge granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint, emphasizing that a lawsuit is not a "megaphone for public relations." The Times welcomed the ruling, asserting the original complaint was a political document designed to stifle independent reporting.</p>
