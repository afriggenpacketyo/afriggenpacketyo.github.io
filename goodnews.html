          <h2>Musk Reverses Course on SpaceX Dragon Decommissioning Amid Trump Feud</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 22:39:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts. This was sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill, leading to a public exchange of insults. However, Musk later retracted the decommissioning plan after receiving advice from an X user, showcasing the volatility of the situation. The Dragon spacecraft is critical as the only U.S. option for transporting crew to and from the International Space Station, and NASA affirmed it would continue working with industry partners to meet space objectives. The situation highlights the complex relationship between government contracts and private space exploration efforts, and it is unclear whether Trump will retaliate against Musk. Optimism surrounding the continuity of the SpaceX program remains, even with the controversy. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's proclamation that sought to bar Harvard University's international students from entering the country. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury." Harvard had sued to block the proclamation, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The judge's order prevents the government from enforcing the proclamation, which Trump justified by claiming Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students. The move marks an escalation in the ongoing feud between the Trump administration and Harvard.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retailers and food brands are increasingly offering products with fewer ingredients, driven by growing consumer concern about ultra-processed foods. This trend is exemplified by M&S's "Only" range and THIS's "Super Superfoods" range. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on ingredient count can lead to the omission of fortified nutrients, potentially harming public health. Experts suggest that simplifying formulas and utilizing new processing technologies can help create less processed products without compromising nutritional value.</p>
