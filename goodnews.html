          <p>Veteran golfer Darren Clarke has returned to Royal Portrush for The Open, holding high hopes for Rory McIlroy, whose early development he significantly supported. Clarke, a 2011 Open champion, expressed immense pride watching McIlroy complete his set of majors at the Masters this year. Despite a frustrating triple-bogey in 2019 that cost him the cut at Portrush, Clarke remains fiercely competitive and is determined to savor this Open, which he acknowledges could be his last. He also highlighted the profound significance of the Open's return to Northern Ireland after decades, reflecting on its role in showcasing the region's progress.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it would include a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the U.S. and grant American firms "full access" to Indonesia's market. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed a "very good call" with Trump, agreeing to a "new era of mutual benefit" in trade relations, though without detailing the tariff rate. As part of the deal, Trump claimed Indonesia committed to significant purchases of U.S. energy, agricultural products, and Boeing jets. This article highlights the unconventional nature of Trump's trade negotiations, similar to a recent deal with Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National League clinched victory in Major League Baseball's 95th All-Star Game, triumphing in the inaugural home run swing-off after the game ended in a 6-6 tie. Dodgers' veteran third base coach Dino Ebel unexpectedly became a central figure, pitching to the NL batters in the decisive tie-breaker. Kyle Schwarber, who went 3-for-3 in the swing-off, secured the win for the NL and earned All-Star Game MVP honors. This new format, designed to add excitement, successfully energized both the stands and the dugouts, providing a dramatic and memorable conclusion to the Midsummer Classic.</p>
