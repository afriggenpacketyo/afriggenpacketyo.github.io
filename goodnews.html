          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has signaled a desire to mend relations with Canada during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand in Beijing. Wang stated that China is prepared to restart dialogue at all levels and work towards rebuilding trust, describing the visit as a potential "fresh start." This development suggests a significant diplomatic shift aimed at moving past recent tensions. Analysts view this as a pragmatic move by Ottawa, creating an opportunity to restore stability to the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the greatest individual postseason performances in baseball history, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out 10 batters while allowing only two hits over six shutout innings. His dominant two-way display secured a four-game sweep of the National League Championship Series and earned him the series MVP award. The Dodgers will now attempt to become the first team to win back-to-back World Series titles in 25 years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the cumulative tariffs on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," even while defending his administration's aggressive trade policies. His comments come as US and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade talks next week in Malaysia, aimed at de-escalating the ongoing economic conflict. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to negotiate a potential truce before a key agreement expires on November 10th. The talks follow China's recent expansion of export controls on critical rare earth minerals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate the diagnosis of more than 50 types of cancer. Results from a North American trial of 25,000 adults showed the test successfully identified cancer in many cases, with over half detected at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers found were types that currently have no routine screening programs, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer. The test, which detects fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, is now undergoing a large-scale trial with the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>A weekend holiday trip inadvertently saved Charlotte Morjaria's life after a minor accident led to the discovery of a cancerous tumor. The 31-year-old from Newport went to the hospital believing she had a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game. A precautionary CT scan revealed a large, cancerous mass on her kidney, of which she had been completely unaware. Following the diagnosis of a rare kidney cancer, she underwent surgery to have the kidney removed and is now cancer-free, crediting the "drunken mishap" for her life-saving diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, has stated that Donald Trump is the "only one who can force" Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, Stubb argued that what is needed is the threat of a "stick" rather than the promise of a "carrot" to compel Russia to seek peace. His comments provide an external diplomatic perspective on Trump's potential role in the conflict, suggesting that the US president's approach could be more effective at advancing peace negotiations than previous efforts.</p>
