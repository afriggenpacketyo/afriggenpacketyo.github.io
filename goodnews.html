        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to withhold federal grant money from over 30 cities and counties designated as "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The ruling protects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants that the administration sought to deny due to these cities' policies of not fully cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. This decision is part of a larger legal battle, as the Department of Justice has also challenged sanctuary policies in various states and cities, particularly those limiting immigration officials' access to courthouses. The legal fight underscores the ongoing tension between federal immigration priorities and local law enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted again on Hawaii's Big Island, sending fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air. The eruption, which began Friday morning, is contained within the summit crater and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular and safe viewing opportunity for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, part of an ongoing pattern where magma accumulates and is forcefully released. Scientists continue to monitor the volcano's activity, which provides valuable data and aligns with Native Hawaiian traditions viewing the lava as the work of the goddess Pele.</p>

Trump stated he has about two weeks to decide on the U.S. approach, which could involve sanctions, tariffs, or non-intervention in the ongoing conflict. Domestically, the administration continued its crime crackdown in Washington D.C., with the president joining a ride-along with police and National Guard troops. Additionally, the White House announced that the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will be held at the Kennedy Center in December, highlighting a mix of major diplomatic and domestic activities.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment (ROI), according to The Princeton Review. The rankings considered factors such as academics, financial aid, and the overall cost of attendance relative to graduates' future earnings. Georgia Tech's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields contributes to the high salaries its alumni command, making it a top value proposition for students. The report highlights how certain public universities can provide a high-quality education and strong career prospects at a relatively lower cost than many private institutions.

          <p>A 71-year-old restaurant owner who had lost movement in his left arm and leg after a stroke has experienced significant recovery thanks to a new medical technology. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. After the implant surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, the patient, Tommy Fello, made more progress in four months than he had previously, regaining function and eliminating chronic pain in his arm. This first-of-its-kind technology offers new hope for stroke survivors whose recovery has plateaued with traditional rehabilitation methods.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With trillions of dollars in real estate expected to be passed down from older generations, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize taxes and family conflicts. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death to allow heirs to benefit from a "step-up in basis," which reduces capital gains taxes if the property is sold. Placing homes in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) can protect the asset from lawsuits and creditors. It is also crucial for parents to create a clear operating agreement for the property's use and to set aside liquid assets to cover ongoing expenses like maintenance and insurance.

          <p>The latest season of the animated show "South Park" is garnering record ratings for its direct and scathing critique of the Trump administration, featuring parodies of figures like President Trump, Kristi Noem, and JD Vance. This aggressive satirical approach comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, has been under political pressure from the administration. Despite this, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are leveraging their creative freedom, bolstered by a new billion-dollar streaming deal with Paramount+. Media analysts suggest the show's financial success and reputation for being "equal opportunity offenders" are providing it with a unique level of protection to speak truth to power.</p>

          <p>In the wake of increasingly destructive hurricanes like Ian, Florida is seeing a shift towards more resilient construction and community planning. Some residents are moving to inland, purpose-built towns like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features like impact-resistant windows, native landscaping for water absorption, and robust infrastructure that withstood a direct hit from Hurricane Ian. In other areas, like Miami's Coconut Grove, city programs and nonprofits are helping low-income residents rebuild their homes at higher elevations and with stronger materials. These efforts reflect a growing recognition of the need to adapt to a future with more frequent and intense storms.</p>

He was able to complete his education through a new compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of the Dozier and Okeechobee schools.

          <p>A recent survey by Empower found that Americans, on average, believe the ideal retirement age is 58, which is significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors caution that retiring this early requires substantial savings to cover a potentially 30- to 40-year period without work, including the years before Medicare eligibility at 65. Many people who retire early do so for unplanned reasons like health or employment issues, rather than financial stability. Experts stress the importance of aggressive, early saving and careful planning to avoid outliving retirement funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists are highlighting a key benefit of tinted sunscreens: they protect against visible light, which standard sunscreens do not. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, the same pigment that gives the products their color. While regular sunscreens focus on blocking UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, the addition of iron oxide in tinted formulas provides a more comprehensive defense against light-induced skin damage, addressing cosmetic concerns that can have a significant psychosocial impact.</p>
