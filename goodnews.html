          <p>Scottie Scheffler won his first Open Championship at Royal Portrush, finishing four shots clear of the competition. The world number one golfer established a commanding lead early in the final round, effectively ending the suspense and securing his fourth major title. This victory, his second major of the year, adds to growing comparisons with Tiger Woods, as Scheffler now only needs the US Open to complete a career Grand Slam. The win came despite hometown favorite Rory McIlroy's emotional finish before a supportive crowd.</p>

          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens achieved his first-ever stage win at the Tour de France, breaking away to claim victory on stage 15. Riding for UAE Team Emirates, Wellens is typically a support rider for race leader Tadej Pogacar but was given the freedom to attack on the day's final climb. He finished one minute and 28 seconds ahead of the nearest chaser, marking the fifth stage win for his team in this year's race. The victory was a celebrated moment for the 34-year-old veteran rider, while Pogacar successfully maintained his substantial overall lead.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has set a target to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030, marking the first time the government has made such a specific commitment. The pledge comes amid public outrage over the pollution of UK waterways and follows new data showing serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024. The minister acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that the industry's regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." This plan is part of a broader effort to overhaul the sector, backed by a £104 billion investment plan.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance, known for his memoir about the Appalachian "hillbillies," is reportedly planning a family holiday in the Cotswolds region of England. The trip is expected to take place next month, following President Trump's visit to Scotland. This comes despite Vance's previous critical remarks about Europe, including a statement that London was "not English any more" and accusations that the UK and Scottish governments suppress free speech. The planned visit highlights a contrast between his political rhetoric and personal travel choices, occurring as tourism from the UK to the US has declined.</p>

          <p>Scottish ultra-runner Anna Rutherford achieved a remarkable victory in a 100-mile race, finishing more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor. The 43-year-old mother-of-three completed the Rat Race from Northumberland to Edinburgh in just 17 hours and 23 minutes. She ran the final 50 miles of the coastal route entirely by herself, at one point singing Dolly Parton songs to keep her spirits up. Her dominant performance was so significant that she had already returned to her home in Peebles by the time the rest of the 600 competitors began finishing.</p>

          <p>David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, argues that finding "neutral ground" is more important than searching for "common ground" in a divided America. In his new book, Litt describes how learning to surf with his politically opposite brother-in-law allowed them to build a friendship despite their disagreements on major issues. He suggests that focusing on a shared activity, rather than forcing political consensus, can foster mutual respect and lead to more genuine discussions. This approach, he believes, allows people to connect as humans first, making it possible to disagree without being disagreeable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill for a child's lifelong success is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. She argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this crucial skill, parents should validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build genuine resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence that protects mental health into adulthood.</p>

          <p>An infectious disease physician and researcher is correcting the record on recent public statements about vaccine safety made by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article refutes claims that children receive 92 mandatory shots, that only COVID-19 vaccines were tested against placebos, and that vaccine advisory committees have pervasive financial conflicts of interest. Citing extensive data, the author explains that the childhood vaccine schedule is safe, all routine vaccines have undergone rigorous placebo-controlled trials, and robust surveillance systems continuously monitor for adverse events. The piece aims to counter misinformation with established scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, a face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to happen this year, potentially in conjunction with the APEC summit in South Korea. The meeting could take place either as a visit to China before the summit or on its sidelines in late October. This development follows stabilizing efforts in U.S.-China relations, including a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats and a preliminary trade deal. Both sides have reportedly expressed a strong desire for the presidential meeting to occur, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a comeback as the famous road's 100th anniversary approaches in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town withered after being bypassed by a new interstate in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are planning events, tours, and restoration projects to attract the thousands of tourists expected to travel the route for the centennial. They hope the anniversary will breathe new life into their community, which they see as a slice of Americana "frozen in time."</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues for a New Method of Measuring the U.S. Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:00:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that traditional methods for measuring the U.S. labor market, such as jobs reports and unemployment rates, are becoming obsolete. With the rise of the "gig economy," remote work, and "over-employed" individuals holding multiple jobs or side hustles, simply counting jobs no longer provides an accurate picture of economic health. The author suggests a shift towards measuring income, proposing a metric that tracks the percentage of the population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold from all sources. This, the article contends, would offer a more relevant understanding of the modern workforce.</p>
