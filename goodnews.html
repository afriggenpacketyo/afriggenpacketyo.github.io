          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has praised US President Donald Trump's diplomatic actions, stating they have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." This statement followed a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which did not result in a formal ceasefire agreement. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that the UK's support for Ukraine remains steadfast until Russia's aggression ceases.</p>

          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet that had been lost 11 years prior by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan. The wallet, belonging to retired autoworker Richard Guilford, had apparently slipped from his pocket and fallen into the airbox of a 2015 Ford Edge he was working on in 2014. After finding the owner's Ford employee ID, the mechanic located him on Facebook and mailed the wallet, which still contained $15 cash and unexpired gift cards, back to him.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a unique, single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" that rotates to optimize flight across different speeds. The design allows the wing to be perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift at low speeds, pivot to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shockwaves at transonic speeds, and align parallel with the fuselage at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5. This innovative approach aims to solve long-standing aerodynamic challenges, potentially realizing a concept once explored by NASA for creating highly versatile and efficient high-speed aircraft.</p>

After purchasing the abandoned property in 2017, former software CEO Mike Conner undertook a challenging five-year project to make the off-grid island habitable, which included installing running water and electricity. The historic 100-man fort now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub, reviving its past reputation as a unique venue for exclusive events.</p>

          <p>As UK families face the financial pressure of feeding children at home during the six-week summer holidays, many are adopting meticulous planning and creative cooking techniques. Parents are using strategies like buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items to freeze, batch cooking meals, and organizing their refrigerators to minimize food waste. With food prices rising and school-subsidized meals unavailable, these tactics, along with support from local food pantries and council vouchers, are crucial for managing household budgets during the extended break from school.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, as 11-year-olds returning to school after a major COVID-19 lockdown. The time capsule project, initiated by their teacher, captured their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. Reading the letters back, the now 16-year-old students reflected on their personal growth, the challenges of their disrupted education, and the youthful questions they had about whether they would have a girlfriend or achieve their dreams.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, offering authentic, regionally diverse cuisine that moves far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition in their home market, brands specializing in fiery Hunanese dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using Singapore as a launchpad for global expansion. These restaurants aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese food as low-brow by providing immersive dining experiences that showcase the sophistication and variety of China's gastronomic culture, potentially serving as a form of "ping-pong diplomacy."</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" captures the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, a period that represented his last major burst of creativity. The collection includes his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage was ending, showcasing his evolution as an expressive singer in middle age. This era was also marked by a significant missed opportunity, as Presley was considered for, but ultimately did not get, a starring role opposite Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," a disappointment some believe hastened his career's decline before his death in 1977.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The late Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, revealed that once he became wealthy, he stopped carrying insurance on assets he could afford to replace, such as cars and houses. He argued that self-insuring is the logical approach for intelligent people who can absorb the financial impact of a loss, as it avoids the "waste" of dealing with insurance companies and paying for the fraudulent claims of others. While acknowledging that Berkshire Hathaway is a major insurance provider, Munger maintained that for those with sufficient wealth, avoiding the claims process and unnecessary premiums is the most efficient strategy.
