          <p>Macy's exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, causing its stock to rise significantly. The retailer attributed the positive performance to revamped stores and strong sales in categories like denim and women's apparel. Consequently, the company has raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, expressing cautious optimism despite potential headwinds from tariffs. The report also highlighted growth across its other brands, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, and an increase in credit card revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed edible microbeads made from green tea, vitamin E, and seaweed that show potential for aiding weight loss. In a study on rats fed a high-fat diet, the microbeads led to a 17% reduction in body weight by blocking fat absorption in the gut. The beads, which are nearly flavorless, reportedly caused fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the FDA-approved drug orlistat. While the components are individually FDA-approved, the formulation awaits regulatory clearance, with human clinical trials currently underway.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley analysis suggests that China's major property developers are poised for a business recovery in the latter half of the year, following a challenging first half. The report predicts that the pace of sales and profitability decline will slow significantly, with an anticipated 2% drop for the rest of the year, culminating in a 10% decrease overall. The bank's positive outlook is based on developers' guidance, expectations of margin recovery, and a large inventory of completed homes in major cities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>English Women's Football Leagues to Introduce Minimum Salaries for Players</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 07:01:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, professional women's football in England will implement minimum salaries for players in the top two divisions, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2. The new requirement, introduced by the governing body WSL Football, aims to ensure all players can earn a full-time wage from the sport, eliminating the need for part-time jobs. The salary thresholds will be determined based on factors like age, league, and experience, following consultation with the Professional Footballers’ Association. This move is part of a broader effort to professionalize the game, which also includes increased standards for club facilities and player welfare.</p>

          <p>A sports columnist is making a bold prediction that the Los Angeles Rams will advance to the Super Bowl this season, citing several key improvements and strategic advantages. The optimism is fueled by the acquisition of receiver Davante Adams, the return of center Coleman Shelton to bolster the offensive line, and the signing of lineman Poona Ford to strengthen the run defense. The article suggests that with a healthy Matthew Stafford, the coaching of Sean McVay, and a relatively favorable schedule, the team has all the necessary components for a deep playoff run and a championship appearance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to a common narrative that marriage and motherhood lead to unhappiness for women, a new survey indicates that married mothers are the happiest demographic among American women aged 25 to 55. The research found that 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to smaller percentages for married women without children, unmarried mothers, and unmarried childless women. This group also reported the highest likelihood of finding life enjoyable and having a clear sense of purpose and meaning. The findings align with other major surveys, challenging prevailing negative messages about family life.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Erik Kramer is sharing his story of surviving a suicide attempt and subsequent financial abuse in a new documentary podcast. After a 2015 suicide attempt left him with diminished mental capacity, a woman he had previously dated re-entered his life, secretly married him, and systematically stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from his savings. Kramer's ordeal sheds light on the challenges of mental health and the vulnerability of those recovering from trauma. Now recovered, Kramer advocates for mental health awareness and speaks about the warning signs of depression, using his extraordinary survival story as a platform for helping others.</p>

          <p>After decades of costly temporary repairs, the California Department of Transportation is moving forward with a plan to build a $2.1 billion tunnel to bypass Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile section of Highway 101. This stretch of road, built on active landslides, is the only viable link for Del Norte County to the rest of the state and has been plagued by closures and instability for over 50 years. The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel through the redwoods would provide a permanent, safer route, though securing funding remains a major challenge. The project highlights the struggle of remote communities to address critical infrastructure needs.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld's program "Gutfeld!" on Fox News has become a dominant force in late-night television, attracting over 3 million nightly viewers and topping the ratings in its 10 p.m. time slot. The show's success is attributed to its irreverent and unpredictable comedic style, which offers a conservative-leaning alternative to mainstream late-night hosts. Gutfeld, who also co-hosts "The Five," argues that other late-night shows alienated a large portion of the country, creating an opportunity he was able to capitalize on. His approach focuses on humor and entertainment, aiming to send viewers to bed happy rather than enraged by politics.</p>

          <h2>Advancements in Space Medicine Crucial for Future Human Travel to Mars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While colonizing Mars is a long-term goal for figures like Elon Musk and NASA, significant hurdles in space medicine must be overcome before humans can safely make the journey. The human body is ill-suited for long-duration spaceflight, facing risks like bone density loss, muscle atrophy, and heightened cancer risk from radiation. The nascent field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, but research is limited by the small number of astronauts who have traveled to space. Future advances, potentially involving AI diagnostics and personalized countermeasures, are essential to make interplanetary travel a viable reality for a broader population.</p>
