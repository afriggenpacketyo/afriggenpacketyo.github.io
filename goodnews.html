          <p>Joseph Nye, a Harvard scholar renowned for his work on international relations and the concept of "soft power," has passed away at the age of 88. Nye significantly influenced the U.S.-Japan alliance and served as dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. His theory of soft power highlighted the impact of cultural and nonmilitary strengths in international relations. Nye also co-authored reports with Richard Armitage to improve the U.S.-Japan relationship, with the latest report issued in April of last year calling for a more integrated partnership amid global security challenges.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce a framework for a trade agreement with the UK, marking the first such deal since imposing sweeping tariffs. Specifics remain unclear, and any agreement requires congressional approval. The US and UK have been in talks for weeks, discussing tariff reductions on US cars and farm products and lower taxes on US tech companies. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has prioritized an agreement with the EU, potentially aligning British standards with European ones.</p>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is teaching an online writing course, prompting debate about the ethics of resurrecting deceased artists. While Christie's estate supports the project, some ethicists question the consent and authenticity of using AI to represent her. The course uses Christie's own words and writings, but critics argue that it is still a deepfake that could blur the lines between fact and fiction. Others contend that the project is a creative way to educate and entertain, drawing from her existing work without harming her reputation.</p>
