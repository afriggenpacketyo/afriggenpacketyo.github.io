          <p>Shares for Oracle saw a significant 22% increase in extended trading after the company announced substantial future growth driven by new cloud contracts, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector. This optimism overshadowed the fact that both its quarterly earnings and revenue fell slightly short of analyst expectations. The company highlighted a massive 359% year-over-year increase in its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue, now totaling $455 billion. Key deals, including one with OpenAI and making Google's Gemini AI models available on its infrastructure, have positioned Oracle as a major beneficiary of the ongoing AI boom.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge concerning the broad tariffs imposed by President Trump through executive order, which two lower courts have already deemed illegal. The administration argues the tariffs are a critical tool for national security and economic stability, citing historical precedent and their role in combating fentanyl trafficking and trade deficits. However, a coalition of businesses and states contends that the president has overstepped congressional authority, inflicting significant harm on American businesses, particularly small ones. The case poses fundamental questions about the separation of powers and the extent of presidential authority over the economy.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was taken into custody for five hours following a dispute with three women in Los Angeles. The incident occurred while Cruz was washing his car and the women parked extremely close to him, refusing his request to move their vehicle. According to his agent, the women began recording him, and as Cruz turned to ask them to stop, some water from the hose he was holding may have inadvertently splashed them. The women reported an alleged assault to the police, leading to his detention, though no charges have been filed and his agent expects the case to be dropped.</p>

The contest is seen as significant for the future direction of the Labour government, with contenders representing different wings of the party.

          <h2>Italian Journalist Responds to Criticism After Excluding Ayo Edebiri from Question on #MeToo and Black Lives Matter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Italian journalist has defended herself against accusations of racism and cyberbullying after a video of her excluding actress Ayo Edebiri from a question went viral. During a press event for the film "After the Hunt," the journalist directed a question to Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield about what was lost in the "politically correct era" now that "the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matters are done."

          <h2>Chief Justice Roberts Temporarily Blocks Order Requiring Trump Administration to Release Foreign Aid Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 16:21:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has issued a temporary stay on a lower court ruling that would have compelled the Trump administration to unfreeze and spend over $4 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid. The administrative stay provides the Supreme Court more time to consider the Justice Department's emergency request to halt the order. The administration is attempting to claw back the funds through a rarely used "pocket rescission" maneuver, arguing that the lower court's decision infringes on the separation of powers. This legal battle is part of a broader conflict over the president's authority to withhold funds appropriated by Congress for various programs.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Geographic Variation in Benefits from New Federal Tax Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 16:07:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that a new tax law signed by President Trump could provide an average tax cut of $3,752 for filers in 2026, but the benefits will vary significantly by state. Residents of Wyoming are projected to see the largest average reduction at $5,374, while those in Mississippi and West Virginia will likely see the smallest cuts. These geographic disparities are primarily due to differences in average state incomes, as the law favors higher-income households. Provisions such as the increased cap for state and local tax deductions will also provide greater benefits to residents in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent technology conference, Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian detailed how the company is successfully generating billions in revenue from its artificial intelligence services. He explained that monetization occurs through three primary channels: consumption-based payments for AI infrastructure, subscription fees for products like Google Workspace and Gemini, and upselling customers to higher-priced tiers and additional services. Kurian noted that the division's backlog of customer demand, now at $106 billion, is growing faster than its revenue, with over half expected to convert to revenue in the next two years. This strategy has contributed to a 32% year-over-year revenue increase for the cloud computing business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has quickly appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new manager, just hours after announcing the departure of Nuno Espírito Santo. Nuno's 21-month tenure ended following a period of public friction with the club's ownership over the pace of transfer business and a disappointing home defeat. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham in June despite winning the Europa League, was selected due to his existing positive relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. The club stated that the new manager has the credentials to help them challenge for trophies, building on the progress made under Nuno, who led the team to a European campaign.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation, including the potential relaunch of inspections at Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, brokered with help from Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog in July following an air war with Israel and the U.S. that targeted its nuclear sites. This development is a crucial step towards transparency, as the IAEA had expressed serious concern over its inability to verify Iran's stockpile of near bomb-grade uranium since the conflict. The agreement arrives at a sensitive time, as European powers have begun reimposing sanctions on Iran for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's Erling Haaland continues to break goalscoring records, recently netting five goals in a single match for Norway. An analysis of his performance reveals that his phenomenal success is due less to superior finishing ability and more to his extraordinary talent for creating high-quality scoring opportunities. Compared to the average player, his finishing accounts for only a small fraction of his goal tally. Instead, his unique combination of strength, speed, anticipation, and movement allows him to get into better scoring positions more frequently than other elite strikers, such as his predecessor at Manchester City, Sergio Agüero.</p>

The decision follows a recent controversy where the company faced widespread backlash, including from President Donald Trump, for introducing a new, more modern logo that removed its "Old Country Store" branding and "Uncle Herschel" character. Although the company quickly reverted to its old logo, it had also been testing updated restaurant layouts in a few locations.
