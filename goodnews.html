          <p>The failed Soviet-era Venus mission probe, Cosmos 482, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere after spending 53 years in orbit. The spacecraft, originally intended to land on Venus, failed to leave Earth's orbit in 1972. Due to its design to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, there is a possibility that Cosmos 482 may survive its Earth re-entry. Experts predict it will re-enter in the early hours of May 10 (UTC), posing a minimal risk to people on Earth.</p>
