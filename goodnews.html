          <p>With schools resuming, parent WhatsApp groups have become a prominent feature, eliciting mixed reactions regarding their utility and impact. While these groups can facilitate information sharing and event coordination, many parents, such as Claire Berry, choose to leave them due to the overwhelming volume of messages, competitive parenting dynamics, and the potential for divisive discussions. Former headteacher Jen Clancy recognizes their value in reaching parents who might miss official communications but also notes the tendency for negative discourse and arguments to affect the school environment. The article delves into the inherent stresses of these informal communication systems, emphasizing the importance of establishing boundaries and fostering respectful engagement among parents.</p>

          <p>The BBC has introduced an engaging interactive tool, playfully named "Cooler Than Me?", which allows users to directly compare their local weather forecasts with those from various cities across the globe. This feature taps into Britain's national inclination for weather-related discussions, offering a unique perspective on global climate variations. By using this tool, individuals can explore whether their current conditions are indeed "cooler" or warmer than other locations, effectively becoming their own meteorologists. The article highlights the tool's ability to provide a broader context for daily weather observations and foster a deeper, more informed understanding of meteorological patterns worldwide.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) has actively collaborated with numerous companies to test advanced counter-small unmanned aerial system (C-sUAS) platforms, aiming to enhance protection for national security facilities against drone incursions. During the 'Falcon Peak 25.2' demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base, various anti-drone systems were evaluated, including an interceptor drone that effectively captured a "hostile" drone with a net. The article underscores the escalating challenge posed by drones, with an estimated 8,000 in U.S. airspace at any given time and over 350 incursions reported at military installations in 2024. USNORTHCOM's objective is to establish nationwide counter-drone response teams capable of addressing any incursion within 24 hours, acknowledging the potential for drones to be modified for nefarious purposes.</p>

          <p>The High Seas Treaty, a pivotal global agreement designed to safeguard the world's oceans and mitigate damage to marine ecosystems, has successfully crossed its critical ratification threshold. With Morocco's 60th ratification, the treaty is now set to officially become international law in January, marking a significant environmental milestone. This landmark accord, developed over two decades, will enable the creation of marine protected areas across international waters, which encompass more than two-thirds of the global ocean. Environmental organizations have hailed this achievement as "monumental," demonstrating that countries can effectively collaborate to address pressing threats like overfishing, pollution, and climate change to conserve marine biodiversity.</p>

          <p>This article explains the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) role and authority regarding broadcast licenses and content regulation, particularly in light of President Trump's suggestions to revoke licenses for critical networks. Established in 1934, the FCC primarily regulates local TV and radio stations, setting rules for obscenity and decency, but generally not directly overseeing national networks or online content. The article details how the FCC's chairman, Brendan Carr, threatened action against ABC following Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, raising questions about government censorship. It clarifies that while the FCC can sanction stations, its power to control content or revoke licenses for specific viewpoints is legally constrained, though its rules are broad.</p>
