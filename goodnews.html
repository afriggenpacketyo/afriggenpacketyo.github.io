          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a "planned partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp., which aims to acquire the company. Trump assured reporters that the deal is structured to ensure U.S. control, emphasizing that it is an investment and partial ownership, but the company will be controlled by the U.S.A. He also mentioned the partnership is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and provide a $14 billion boost to the economy, with Nippon Steel's investment occurring over the next 14 months.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. The company attributes this increase to its more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in its detection systems. Tripadvisor's system relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions, categorized as boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews. The company uses AI and behavioral biometrics to detect patterns and penalizes violators by lowering their rankings or adding a warning badge to their listing.</p>
