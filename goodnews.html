          <p>China is strategically embedding robotics into its societal and economic fabric, aiming for comprehensive technological independence in artificial intelligence. Last year, the country installed nearly 300,000 new robots, surpassing the rest of the world combined, signaling a drive beyond industrial efficiency. Government initiatives, such as Made in China 2025 and the AI Plus action plan, promote widespread robotics adoption across diverse sectors from manufacturing to healthcare. This cohesive, long-term policy framework cultivates immense domestic demand for advanced AI capabilities, fostering a robust market for indigenous AI chips and infrastructure, as Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperPoD demonstrates. This article highlights a distinct public-private collaboration model, contrasting with Western approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's plan to reduce disaster relief and anti-terrorism funding for states with "sanctuary" policies. California, along with ten other states and the District of Columbia, successfully argued that these cuts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, were an illegal attempt to tie grant funding to immigration policies. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta lauded the decision as a win against unlawful power grabs, emphasizing that homeland security funding is crucial for community safety and should not be politicized. This article underscores ongoing legal battles over state sovereignty and federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is exploring a motion to commission a study on the effects of establishing a minimum wage of over $32 an hour for workers on residential construction projects. The proposal also includes an additional $7.65 per hour healthcare credit, aiming to attract workers to an industry facing severe labor shortages. Backers argue that increased wages and benefits are essential to protect often non-union, foreign-born construction workers vulnerable to exploitation and to address the city's need to rebuild housing units.

          <p>Nike posted a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding expectations, yet its profits fell by 31% and gross margin dropped. This indicates that while the company is generating momentum, its turnaround strategy, which involves clearing old inventory through discounting, is still impacting profitability. CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged progress in wholesale, running, and North America, but noted struggles in other areas like direct sales and China. This article suggests that Nike's efforts to reignite innovation and regain market share are a complex process with non-linear recovery.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed SB 53, a new law requiring "frontier" AI model developers to publish transparency reports and safety frameworks. This legislation aims to address potential "catastrophic risks" from AI, such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks, by mandating companies report critical safety incidents and establishing whistleblower protections. The article notes that while this single state law may not prevent all disasters, it represents a significant effort to regulate fast-moving technology and hold companies accountable for AI safety. The law defines catastrophic risk as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages.</p>
