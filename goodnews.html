          <p>Liverpool Football Club has reportedly reached an agreement to sign German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of ¬£116 million. The deal includes a guaranteed ¬£100 million with an additional ¬£16 million contingent on the Reds achieving sustained success at the elite level. If achieved, the bonus payments would make this a British record transfer, surpassing Chelsea's signing of Enzo Fernandez. This move signals Liverpool's intent to strengthen their squad with a highly-rated young talent.</p>

His invention of the barley abrasion process earned him international recognition, while his leadership of Edinburgh's Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group highlighted his commitment to social justice.

          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months, reflecting the dollar's recent decline. The People's Bank of China fixed the midpoint rate at 7.1772 per US dollar, the highest since late March, as the US dollar index fell to a three-year low. This decline follows lower-than-expected producer price index data in the US, leading to increased expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policy and debt levels have also contributed to the dollar's weakness, bolstering the yuan's relative strength. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists assert that the recent decline in white-collar job openings is primarily due to structural economic issues rather than the displacement of workers by artificial intelligence. Despite a decrease in hiring within professional and business services, sectors like healthcare, construction, and manufacturing are experiencing job growth. Experts emphasize that AI technology is still in its early stages and requires human intervention to execute key skills effectively. While acknowledging the potential for future transformation, economists suggest that the current decline is more closely tied to broader economic factors than to AI-driven disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The Strait of Hormuz sees approximately 20 million barrels of oil and oil products pass through daily, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Experts argue that impeding oil passage would not benefit Iran, especially since Iranian oil infrastructure has not been directly targeted. Moreover, such action could provoke further retaliation and draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer, which relies on stable oil flows and prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Attenborough's Ocean film is praised for its blunt portrayal of the plunder of the seas, highlighting the urgent need for marine conservation. The film emphasizes the primary cause of marine destruction: the fishing industry, and challenges the notion that environmental issues turn away viewers. A proposed ban on bottom trawling in marine protected areas is welcomed but considered the bare minimum. The author calls for a reversal of the presumption of exploitation, advocating for protection as the default state of the seas, with limited fishing activities permitted in the least fragile areas, with local coastal communities prioritized.</p>

Concerns around mental health and financial worries are key issues for young men, according to a recent report by the Speaking with American Men (SAM) project.
