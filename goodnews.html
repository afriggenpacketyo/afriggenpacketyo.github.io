          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled by a beach umbrella pole in a bizarre accident. The teen, identified only as Alex, was attempting to secure the umbrella when a gust of wind pulled her off the lifeguard stand, causing her to land on the pole which went through her armpit. Remarkably, the pole missed all major arteries and nerves by a fraction of a centimeter. First responders had to use a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport, and throughout the ordeal, Alex remained surprisingly calm, a trait her colleagues attributed to her lifeguard training.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has directly imaged a potential new planet outside our solar system. The exoplanet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn's, orbiting a young star. Scientists utilized a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph, which blocks the star's bright light to reveal fainter nearby objects. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered planet, marking a significant achievement for the telescope.</p>

          <p>The victory of self-described Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary has intensified the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party. Mamdani's win over a more established, moderate candidate highlights the party's ideological divide between its progressive and centrist wings. His campaign, focused on affordability with proposals like free childcare and rent freezes, energised younger voters, raising questions about whether his playbook represents a viable path forward for Democrats nationally. While some party leaders have praised his win, others have expressed concern over his progressive platform, reflecting the party's broader identity struggle.</p>

He characterized Mamdani, a self-described Democratic socialist, as an inexperienced lawmaker making "empty promises." Adams, who is now running as an independent, aims to convince voters that his practical approach is more effective than his opponent's progressive and socialist ideals.</p>

The clarification came after President Donald Trump made a sudden announcement at an event, stating, "we just signed with China yesterday." An administration official later explained that the two nations had reached an "additional understanding for a framework" based on talks that began last month in Geneva.

          <p>A California appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a top advisor to former L.A. County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n. Teran was accused of illegally downloading confidential police records from the Sheriff's Department and using them in her role at the D.A.'s office. In a stinging rebuke to the prosecution, the court ruled that her actions were not criminal because the documents she accessed were publicly available court records. The case had been highly politicized, with critics charging that it was a vindictive prosecution aimed at undermining Gasc√≥n's police accountability efforts.</p>

However, this article advises consumers to take three crucial steps before applying. First, individuals should honestly determine if they truly need such a program, as it can take years and damage their credit score. Second, they should explore all alternatives, such as debt management plans or consolidation loans, which may be more suitable.
