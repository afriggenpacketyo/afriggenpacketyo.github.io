          <p>NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen are in last-minute negotiations to avert a strike that could impact over 300,000 commuters. The union is seeking pay raises, citing a five-year wage freeze, while NJ Transit aims for a fair wage that is reasonable for fare riders and taxpayers. A contingency plan, accommodating only 20% of daily riders, will include cross-honoring rail tickets on buses, light rail lines, and the MTA. Governor Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike commences, and commuters are urged to work from home if possible. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have ignited internal debate about potentially outsourcing the AI industry. The deals, negotiated by administration officials with ties to Silicon Valley, aim to boost American AI companies and expand their reach. However, critics fear inadequate protections could allow the technology to benefit China, and that these deals might lead to the world's largest data centers being located in the Middle East instead of the United States. The administration defends the agreements as necessary to win the AI race and ensure American technology remains at the forefront. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 years ago. These migrations were facilitated by the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents when sea levels were lower. The study, published in the journal Science, analyzed fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. This suggests that genetic exchanges occurred in both directions across the land bridge. </p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court is considering Donald Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order, a move that directly contradicts the 14th Amendment. The court is also examining whether federal judges should be able to issue nationwide injunctions that restrict the president's authority. The administration argues that these injunctions unfairly tie the president's hands, while critics contend they are necessary to check executive power and uphold the Constitution.

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million.

The event is intended to honor all who have served since the nation's founding, but has drawn criticism from Democrats who deem it a wasteful display of ego.

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This contraction, exceeding economists' expectations, is attributed to uncertainties stemming from President Trump's trade policies. The Bank of Japan has warned of potential economic moderation due to global trade policies, and the country is currently engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. Despite these concerns, the central bank is likely to continue raising its policy rate, driven by inflation surpassing the 2% target for three consecutive years. </p>
