        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a dominant performance, scoring eight tries to defeat the Western Force in Perth. The victory showcased the team's potent attacking style under coach Andy Farrell, though it was marred by some concerns. Key scrum-half Tomos Williams left the match with a hamstring injury, potentially requiring a replacement to be called up. The team also struggled with discipline, conceding numerous penalties in the first half, an issue Farrell attributed to over-eagerness. Despite these challenges, the performance of players like Joe McCarthy and the team's ambitious strategy signal a promising start to the tour.</p>

          <p>Germany is preparing to launch a parliamentary inquiry commission to review its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, as former Health Minister Jens Spahn faces criticism over mask procurement. Spahn is under fire for ordering overpriced masks that were never paid for, potentially costing taxpayers billions. The new inquiry, supported by governing parties and scientists, aims to rebuild public trust and learn lessons for future crises. It will examine the government's decision-making processes, the role of scientific advice, and the coordination between federal and state authorities during lockdowns. The commission is expected to begin its work in September 2025.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the film "Rust" against the movie's producers, including Alec Baldwin. The lawsuit alleged negligence leading to emotional distress following the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. The plaintiffs, who witnessed the incident, claimed producers failed to adhere to industry safety standards. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. This civil case resolution is separate from the criminal proceedings, which saw armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed convicted of involuntary manslaughter, while a similar charge against Baldwin was dismissed.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris delivered a stunning qualifying performance to secure pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing his nearest competitor by more than half a second. Norris's exceptional lap placed him ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in second and his own teammate, championship leader Oscar Piastri, in third. The result is a significant boost for Norris, who is looking to close the points gap to Piastri in the driver's standings. Ferrari's strong showing, with both cars in the top four, suggests their recent car upgrades are effective, setting the stage for a competitive race against the dominant McLaren team.</p>

          <p>British authorities have made one of the country's largest-ever drug seizures, confiscating 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The massive haul, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million ($132 million), was discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The seizure was the result of an intelligence-led operation by the UK Border Force. Officials noted that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle cocaine into the UK, which is one of Europe's largest markets for the drug. This bust highlights ongoing efforts to dismantle international drug trafficking operations.</p>

Festivities began on Thursday and culminated in the Friday wedding, which took place amid tight security on one of the Venetian islands. The high-profile gathering also drew some local protests from residents concerned about the impact of over-tourism and a campaign called "No Space for Bezos." This marks the second marriage for both the 61-year-old billionaire and the 55-year-old media personality.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying threats of "legal consequences" from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a police ban issued under a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. Attendees, including EU officials and MEPs showing solidarity, risked fines and potential prison sentences for organizing. Participants expressed their desire for a diverse and tolerant Hungary, protesting the law which they argue infringes on fundamental human rights. The large turnout was seen by organizers as a powerful symbol of civil society's strength against increasing government pressure.</p>

This comes after Nagasaki's city government did not invite Israel to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a move that prompted G7 ambassadors to withdraw in solidarity. For this year's event, the city has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions. The Israeli ambassador stated his attendance will show respect for the Japanese people and a mutual understanding of peace. Russia has also confirmed its attendance for the first time since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed new international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer of eel. The proposal, submitted under the CITES treaty for endangered species, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for all eel transactions if adopted. Scheduled to take effect in June 2027, the measure aims to protect dwindling eel populations by regulating the global market. Japan has argued against the curbs, which would significantly impact its domestic supply and culinary traditions. The proposal will be debated at the upcoming CITES conference.</p>

          <h2>Gas Prices Expected to Fall, Potentially Leading to Cheapest Summer Since 2021</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that U.S. gas prices are set to decline, potentially making this the cheapest summer for fuel since 2021. According to one analyst, the national average could fall below $3 a gallon by September. A recent price spike, driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to reverse now that a ceasefire is in place, allowing prices to resume a gradual downward trend. This typical summer decline is attributed to increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early travel peaks. Adjusted for inflation, current gas prices are already near 20-year lows, consuming a smaller portion of American incomes. (not investment advice)</p>
