        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cooper Flagg, a highly anticipated prospect, is likely to be the first overall pick in the upcoming NBA Draft after the Dallas Mavericks won the NBA Draft lottery. Flagg, who played for Duke, led the team in multiple statistical categories and earned the Naismith Player of the Year Award as a freshman. The Mavericks' victory in the lottery is seen as a positive turn after trading Luka Donƒçiƒá and facing fan criticism. The NBA Draft is scheduled for June 25, where Flagg's official destination will be confirmed.</p>

          <p>President Trump endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, solidifying Ciattarelli's position in the upcoming primary. Ciattarelli, who previously distanced himself from Trump, has openly courted the president's support, a move that could prove risky in the traditionally left-leaning state. Trump acknowledged Ciattarelli's initial reluctance but praised his current full support. The endorsement comes shortly before a debate among Democratic candidates, highlighting the competitive nature of the gubernatorial race.</p>

          <p>A group of 59 white South Africans arrived in the US after their refugee applications were expedited under President Trump's plan, citing racial discrimination. The South African government denies these claims, stating that the group does not meet the criteria for refugee status. This decision has sparked controversy, with critics accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy and unequal treatment, as other refugees face indefinite suspension. The US has also criticized South Africa's land reform policies, further straining bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) lifted its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January due to allegations of inciting sedition and interfering in internal affairs. The PA's attorney general stated that a court would issue an order to that effect, but provided no details about what had changed since the ban was implemented. The PA, dominated by the Fatah party, has long had strained relations with Al Jazeera, which it has accused of supporting Hamas.</p>

          <p>News of a US agreement with China to temporarily ease tariffs sent stocks soaring, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing significant gains. The agreement, struck in Switzerland, will lower tariffs by 115% for 90 days. While investors cheered the market rally, some cautioned that volatility could return as the tariff pause nears its end in August. The news also eased fears that tariffs could push the U.S. into a serious slump.</p>

          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at New Jersey's Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the Biden administration for not better equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia and announced plans to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system. The FAA restricted traffic into Newark after previous incidents, leading to cancellations and delays.
