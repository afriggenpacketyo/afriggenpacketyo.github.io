          <p>East Los Angeles residents defiantly celebrated their 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade amidst the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown and recent Supreme Court rulings authorizing "roving patrols" by federal agents. Despite fears stoked by ongoing ICE raids, which have targeted individuals based on appearance or language, many felt it was crucial to participate and assert their rights and cultural pride. Mayor Karen Bass expressed strong opposition to the raids, emphasizing Los Angeles' identity as a city of immigrants and denouncing the targeting of Latino residents as abhorrent. The event, though possibly less attended, radiated joy and resistance, uniting diverse communities in a vibrant display of heritage.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Chinese scholar, argues that China must develop its own knowledge system for AI, moving beyond Western-centric theories. He expresses concern about "intellectual colonialism" in the AI era, noting that Western social science theories, while influential, are based on Western practices and fail to adequately explain civilizations like Confucian, Islamic, or Indian societies. Zheng asserts that the meaning of society and technology is shaped by humanities and social sciences, urging China to embrace its secular civilization to play a proper role in the international order. This perspective advocates for a distinct, culturally rooted approach to AI development.</p>
