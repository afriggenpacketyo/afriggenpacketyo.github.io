          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 04:37:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures indicating a drop in vacancies and a slight decrease in payroll numbers. Job openings fell by 5.8% to 718,000 between May and July, reaching their lowest point since early 2021, primarily in the hospitality and retail sectors. Despite this slowdown, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Economists suggest this gradual cooling may be a sign that the economic pressures from increased business taxes and the minimum wage are beginning to stabilize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is actively exploring a potential deal to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze. The move is part of an effort to strengthen their attacking options, especially after key midfielder James Maddison was sidelined with a long-term knee injury. Eze, who scored 14 goals for Palace last season and was part of England's Euro 2024 squad, has emerged as a primary target for the club. While Spurs are also in discussions for Manchester City's Savinho, sources indicate that interest in Eze is serious, though it remains unconfirmed if both players will be pursued.</p>

          <p>An American teenage pilot, Ethan Guo, who was stranded on a remote Antarctic island since June, has had all charges against him dropped. The 19-year-old was detained by Chilean authorities and accused of providing false flight plan information after illegally landing his plane in Chilean territory during a solo flight to all seven continents. A judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo, who was attempting to become the youngest person to complete the flight challenge for charity, is now awaiting approval to continue his mission.</p>

The smuggled animals, primarily eastern box and three-toed box turtles, are native to the U.S. and highly valued as status symbols in the pet trade in China. The seized turtles have an estimated market value of $1.4 million. The man, who also shipped other reptiles including venomous snakes, faces up to five years in prison, highlighting ongoing efforts to combat the illegal international wildlife trade.</p>

The company is shifting its focus from shopping to "experiences," launching new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium.

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for another 90 days, narrowly avoiding a new round of tariff hikes. The agreement keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations on "remedying trade imbalances" and other economic issues, while China called for the U.S. to lift its "unreasonable" restrictions. While the truce averts immediate escalation, it prolongs uncertainty for businesses, and significant trade disputes over technology, rare earths, and TikTok remain unresolved between the two economic superpowers.

          <p>A three-year-old mystery surrounding the disappearance of cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of his killer's girlfriend. After her boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he took her to the remote location where he and his brother had buried the body. The girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, secretly dropped a Red Bull can at the shallow grave to mark the spot and later alerted the police. This crucial clue led investigators to recover Parsons' body, bringing a long-awaited resolution to his family, who expressed immense gratitude for her actions.</p>

          <p>Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he agreed to join Manchester United back in 2012 and was keen to play for manager Sir Alex Ferguson. However, the move from Borussia Dortmund never materialized because the German club refused to sell him, believing they could earn more by keeping him for another couple of years. Despite missing the chance to play in the Premier League, Lewandowski expressed no major regrets, stating he is very happy with his decorated career at top European clubs. He also reflected on the influence of his former Dortmund manager, Jürgen Klopp, whom he described as a father-like figure.</p>

          <p>Two anglers in Delaware have set new state records after catching exceptionally large specimens of two invasive fish species. One fisherman reeled in a 33-pound flathead catfish, while another landed a 15-pound northern snakehead. Both species, native to other regions, pose a significant threat to Delaware's native aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting local wildlife like largemouth bass. The state's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) is actively encouraging anglers to catch and kill these invasive fish as a method of population control to help protect and restore the natural balance of local waterways.</p>

          <p>In the trial for California's lawsuit against the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, a commanding general testified he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit questions whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars domestic military law enforcement. The Trump administration justified the action under a law allowing the president to use the Guard during a "rebellion." Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman's testimony challenges a key part of the federal government's legal argument, adding a significant development to the ongoing legal battle over presidential power and military deployment within the U.S.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Lula da Silva held a phone call to discuss strengthening their bilateral relationship, which Xi described as being at its "best ever." The call, requested by Lula, took place shortly after the U.S. extended a trade truce with China but did not offer similar relief to other nations, highlighting a difference in treatment. Xi emphasized that the two nations should work together to set an example of solidarity and self-reliance for the Global South. This conversation signals a strategic alignment between the two countries in response to ongoing global trade dynamics and U.S. economic policies.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian technology firm has released video showing its "Sting" interceptor drone reaching speeds of up to 195 miles per hour, roughly the velocity of a bullet train. This low-cost, $2,500 first-person-view (FPV) drone is specifically designed to chase down and destroy the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions used by Russia. Speed is a critical factor for these interceptors, as they must catch the Shaheds, which fly at over 100 mph. Ukraine is increasingly relying on this innovative, low-cost technology to bolster its air defenses against Russia's large-scale drone attacks, with a national goal of building 1,000 such drones daily.</p>
