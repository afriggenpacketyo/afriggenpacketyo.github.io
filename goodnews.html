          <p>Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates discussed President Trump's foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East, noting both opportunities and challenges. Gates highlighted the weakened state of Iran due to Israeli attacks and the potential for a nuclear deal, emphasizing that Iran must cease all enrichment activities. He also addressed the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, suggesting that while cutting off military supplies to Israel would be difficult politically, pressure should be applied to end the war in Gaza. Gates further commented on the situation in Ukraine, expressing skepticism about Putin's intentions and advising President Trump to leverage pressure in any potential meetings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, has emerged as the frontrunner in the first round of Poland's presidential election, though falling short of a majority. Trzaskowski, representing Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Platform, is set to compete in a runoff against Karol Nowrocki, backed by the hard-right Law and Justice party. The election is viewed as a crucial test of Tusk's ability to reverse hard-right policies implemented by the previous administration. The outcome will significantly impact Tusk's agenda, given the presidency's veto powers, as he seeks to restore judicial independence, media pluralism, and civil rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes in Sunday's election but will fall short of an outright majority. This election, the third in as many years, aims to bring stability to Portugal, one of the EU's poorest countries. The AD will need to negotiate with smaller parties to secure a majority in parliament, while the far-right Chega party is expected to perform strongly. Key issues dominating the election include housing and immigration, reflecting long-term political instability and economic challenges in Portugal.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's recent FA Cup victory has ignited discussions about their growing dominance in women's football, raising questions about whether any team can challenge their supremacy. With significant investment, including a world-record transfer fee for Naomi Girma, and the return of Sam Kerr from injury, Chelsea's future looks promising. While Manchester United aims to compete, they face financial constraints and need further investment to close the gap. The manager of Chelsea says that if there is more competition, they are able to perform better and that they want to be at the top of the league and bring everyone with them.</p>
