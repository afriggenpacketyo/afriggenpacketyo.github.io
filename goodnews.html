Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins were also left out of the matchday squad, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting his omission is related to his fitness. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, has not yet played under Tuchel after missing the German's first camp due to injury.
