          <p>Meta has signed a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase nuclear power, securing the future of Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which was at risk of closing. This deal highlights the increasing energy demands of AI data centers, benefiting companies like GE Vernova and Eaton. The agreement involves Meta buying approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy starting in June 2027, underscoring the critical role of reliable power sources for supporting AI infrastructure. The agreement points to the growing power needs of AI data centers, hence why portfolio names GE Vernova and Eaton ‚Äî which both benefit from that trend ‚Äî are also higher Tuesday on the news. </p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison for a murder he was wrongly convicted of due to the misconduct of former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell, the 51st person exonerated in a case involving Guevara, was initially a shooting victim who was then framed for an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify a suspect chosen by Guevara. While his murder conviction was previously overturned, a carjacking conviction remained until a judge vacated it, citing Guevara's pattern of misconduct. Prosecutors subsequently dropped the carjacking charge, fully exonerating McDowell.</p>

          <p>South Korea is anticipating a shift in leadership as exit polls indicate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party is likely to win the snap presidential election, triggered by the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee's victory would place the Democratic Party in control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since 2022. Lee, a veteran politician, has pledged to strengthen the U.S.-South Korea alliance and manage relations with China and Russia while prioritizing South Korea's national interests. He also faces ongoing criminal cases, including a property development scandal, but South Korean presidents have significant immunity from prosecution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a temporary pause on the garnishment of Social Security benefits for student loan borrowers in default. This decision reverses a policy that was implemented on May 5, which allowed the Education Department to collect overdue debts by garnishing federal payments, including Social Security checks. The department stated it is committed to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on fixed incomes, and will proactively reach out to recipients about affordable loan repayment options. The pause comes after a previous adjustment to clawback policies, reducing the amount taken from monthly checks to recover overpayments.</p>

          <p>An inmate in Wisconsin has confessed to writing letters threatening President Donald Trump in an attempt to frame Ramon Morales-Reyes, a migrant who was to testify against him in a trial. According to court documents, Demetric Deshawn Scott admitted to writing the letters to get Morales-Reyes deported, thus preventing him from testifying in a robbery case. Morales-Reyes was initially arrested by ICE agents after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of writing the threatening letters, but a handwriting test did not match the letters. Scott now faces charges including identity theft and felony intimidation of a witness.</p>

          <p>McDonald's will reintroduce snack wraps to its U.S. menu on July 10, seeking to boost sales after a sluggish start to the year. The fast-food chain discontinued the item in 2016 due to kitchen slowdowns, but customer demand has persisted over the years. The new snack wraps will feature McCrispy Strips and come in spicy and ranch flavors, aligning with McDonald's broader strategy to expand its chicken offerings. The return of snack wraps could potentially intensify competition in the fast-food chicken market, following Popeyes' recent announcement of its own chicken wraps.</p>

He served as mayor of Seongnam, where he implemented welfare programs despite opposition from the central government, and has pledged to address the country's partisan rifts.

The ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers was close to the March level, and analysts suggest the labor market is returning to more normal levels despite broader economic uncertainty.
