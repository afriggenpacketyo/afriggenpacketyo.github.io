          <p>President Trump has announced he is considering imposing a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, claiming the American film industry is "dying" due to incentives offered by other nations. Trump believes this is a national security threat, considering it "messaging and propaganda." He has authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin the process. Trump emphasized the desire for movies to be made in America again, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicating support for the initiative. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the Constitution during the 2020 election. In his acceptance speech, Pence emphasized the Constitution as the common ground binding Americans together. His remarks came shortly after an interview aired where Trump was noncommittal about whether everyone in the U.S. is entitled to due process, as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Pence's actions during the transfer of power and his willingness to challenge Trump's claims have positioned him as a defender of constitutional principles. Optimism score: 80</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory following scrutiny over experiments involving the brutal killing of thousands of beagles. This decision follows a report detailing the lab's alleged practices, including infecting beagles with pneumonia-causing bacteria and subjecting them to septic shock. Animal rights groups, like PETA, have praised the closure, with PETA highlighting Anthony Fauci's alleged approval of funding for tests in Tunisia where beagle puppies were drugged and their heads were locked in cages filled with hungry, infected sandflies. The company that bred the beagles for research, Envigo, pleaded guilty in 2024 to neglecting thousands of dogs at its Cumberland, Virginia, breeding facility. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed judicial nominations, stating that the administration is rapidly appointing judges who will not demand trials for every single illegal immigrant. Trump argued that providing trials for millions of people who have entered the country illegally is not feasible. He claimed that "radicalized" judges are delaying his administration's overhaul of U.S. immigration policies, which he considers his top priority. Trump also suggested that the Supreme Court would not support requiring trials for all illegal immigrants, as it would overwhelm the system. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies are influencing domestic political battles worldwide, with recent elections in Canada and Australia seeing centrists revived and parties borrowing from the MAGA playbook losing out. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an explicitly anti-Trump message. However, in Germany, the effect has been less direct, with Friedrich Merz able to push through spending limit suspensions by arguing that American commitment to mutual defense is uncertain. Britain is an exception, where Nigel Farage's party has scored significant gains despite Trump's ally struggling to fend off accusations that he sympathizes with President Vladimir V.

          <p>More American women are freezing their eggs to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures increasing significantly. Egg freezing for non-medical reasons became an accepted practice 12 years ago, and since then, demand has skyrocketed. This technology allows women to delay motherhood, with experts claiming it is as revolutionary as the pill was in the 1960s and 70s. However, there are concerns regarding the financial cost, medical risks, and the fact that it is not a guarantee, as well as the potential for private equity-backed fertility companies to prioritize profits over patient care.
