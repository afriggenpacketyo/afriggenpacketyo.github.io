          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has reduced its base interest rate for the first time this year, mirroring a similar 25-basis-point cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. This move is intended to lower borrowing costs to support businesses and ease the financial pressure on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's decision was prompted by signs of a softening U.S. labor market, as noted by Chairman Jerome Powell. This initial cut is widely seen by market analysts as the beginning of a rate-reduction cycle expected to continue into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a widely expected quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, bringing its benchmark rate to a target range of 4%-4.25%. Projections from committee members, known as the "dot plot," indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the move as a "risk management" cut aimed at sustaining economic expansion amid signs of a weakening labor market. However, the forecast of a slower pace of cuts in subsequent years created a mixed reaction in financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>
