          <p>Sovereignty secured a win at the 151st Kentucky Derby, outperforming 18 other horses on a wet track at Churchill Downs, with Journalism finishing in second place. Sovereignty's team, consisting of owner Godolphin, jockey Junior Alvarado, and trainer William Mott, will share a substantial portion of the $5 million prize. Journalism encountered difficulties early in the race, but Sovereignty, after finishing second in the Florida Derby and winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes, demonstrated strength and stamina, securing the win in 2:02.31 for the 1 1/4 mile race. Mott secured his first Derby win in 2019 under similar weather conditions, marking another victory on a sloppy track.</p>

The event, anticipated to be the pop star's largest show to date, is part of Rio's strategy to stimulate the local economy during the low season, with officials expecting an injection of approximately $100 million. Security measures were heightened with the deployment of thousands of military personnel, police officers, and firefighters, along with drones and surveillance technology. Lady Gaga's return to Brazil after over a decade was highly anticipated, as she had to cancel her appearance at the Rock in Rio festival in 2017 due to health concerns.</p>

          <p>A Florida homeowner discovered 98 iguana eggs in her backyard, prompting a call to Humane Iguana Control, revealing a record number of eggs from three interconnected iguana nests. Michael Ronquillo, owner of the control service, emphasized that iguanas pose health risks, cause property damage, and can compromise infrastructure by burrowing. He advised homeowners to flag potential burrows and contact professionals instead of attempting removal themselves, as iguanas are invasive, not native to Florida, and can be dangerous to handle. Iguanas arrived in Florida through the pet trade and cargo ships, thriving due to the warm climate and lack of natural predators.</p>

The legislation addresses concerns raised after the 2021 Surfside condo collapse, which prompted stricter requirements for inspections and reserve funding.
