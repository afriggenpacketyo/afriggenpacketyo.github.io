        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how to identify and manage friendships with "energy vampires" – individuals who drain your emotional and mental reserves. Common signs include excessive need for attention, constant complaining, and a lack of interest in your life, often leaving you feeling exhausted after interactions. Psychologists and journalists suggest that honest communication is crucial; expressing feelings of not being heard or having space can help maintain the friendship if the other person is receptive. If not, setting clear boundaries, reducing contact, or changing shared activities, like opting for walks over intense conversations, are recommended strategies to protect your well-being.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:30:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations for green marine fuels, particularly methanol, are heavily dependent on establishing a robust supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling operations, the challenge lies in creating a reliable system for importing, storing, and selling mainland-produced green methanol tax-free. This comes as CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, embarks on its maiden voyage with a quarter green methanol fuel mix, despite its higher cost. The company anticipates increasing green methanol usage from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has secured a significant victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections marred by claims of Russian interference. With 96% of votes counted, PAS neared 50%, far ahead of the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc. Sandu had warned of "massive Russian interference," and bomb scares were reported at polling stations internationally and domestically, leading to arrests for plotting unrest. This election is crucial for Moldova's path to EU integration, a process challenged by Russian influence, a pro-Russian breakaway region, and domestic issues like high prices and corruption.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading results on Monday as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) commenced its two-day policy meeting, where it is widely expected to maintain its cash rate at 3.6%. Analysts note growing tension in Australia's economic data, with August CPI suggesting upside risks to inflation alongside signs of softer employment and moderating wage growth. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix declined after a Friday record high, while South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq saw gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures indicated a higher opening, contrasting with the previous week's losses for major U.S. indexes despite a Friday rally driven by inflation data.

          <p>Tutu Atwell, previously a quiet presence this NFL season, emerged as the hero for the Los Angeles Rams, catching an 88-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford with under two minutes remaining to secure a 27-20 comeback win against the Indianapolis Colts. This pivotal play marked a significant moment for Atwell, who had seen limited targets in earlier games. Stafford also delivered touchdown passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, while Kam Curl contributed two interceptions, improving the Rams' record to 3-1. The team's strengthened run defense also contained Jonathan Taylor, positioning them as potential Super Bowl contenders despite ongoing inconsistencies.</p>

          <p>Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), transformed the mixed martial arts league from an unprofitable, unsanctioned sport into a global phenomenon worth over $15 billion. White's strategic risks, including securing early venues like Donald Trump's Taj Mahal and launching "The Ultimate Fighter" reality series, were pivotal to its growth. The UFC's unapologetically masculine brand and White's assertive leadership, including firing production staff, have resonated with a core demographic, leading to massive media rights deals. White maintains a friendship with former President Trump, who remains a loyal fan, and even plans to host a historic fight at the White House, showcasing the league's mainstream penetration.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring to manage overwhelming tourist numbers. With 2.6 million visitors last year, significantly outnumbering its 100 residents, the village faces issues like privacy invasion and overcrowding. The fee aims to control visitor flow and fund maintenance and infrastructure improvements, offering museum and windmill access as a sweetener. While some tourists express hesitation over the cost, local shop and restaurant owners fear a loss of business. The initiative highlights a growing global challenge for small, popular destinations grappling with overtourism.</p>

          <p>The kārearea, New Zealand's native falcon, has won the fiercely contested annual Bird of the Year election, triumphing over more conventionally "cute" contenders. This unique poll, run by Forest & Bird, draws attention to the country's highly threatened native bird species, 80% of which are in peril. Despite a history of controversies, including a bat winning in 2021 and fraudulent votes in 2018, this year's election saw over 75,000 votes, mostly from New Zealand. The majestic kārearea, known for its speed and hunting prowess, is a vulnerable species facing threats like electrocution and habitat loss, making its victory a significant moment for conservation awareness.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Labour Chancellor, is set to announce a new policy guaranteeing paid work placements for young people aged 18-24 who have been unemployed or out of education for 18 months. Those who refuse the offer without valid reason could face benefit sanctions. This initiative, building on a previous "youth guarantee," aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, which currently affects nearly a million young people. The scheme will involve private companies in providing placements to help build skills, with funding drawn from existing budgets. This policy reflects Labour's commitment to a society founded on "contribution" and ensuring "hard work is matched by fair reward."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to face the Cincinnati Reds in the National League wild-card series, following the Reds' dramatic clinch of the final playoff spot. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, despite claiming indifference to the opponent, acknowledges the Reds as a "gritty, hungry, younger group" that will be formidable. The Reds overcame long odds with a strong late-season surge, led by veteran manager Terry Francona. Key concerns for the Dodgers include the Reds' talented young shortstop Elly De La Cruz, former Dodger Gavin Lux, and a strong starting rotation featuring hard-throwing Hunter Greene. Recent playoff history also shows road teams often triumph in the best-of-three wild card format, signaling a challenging series for Los Angeles.</p>
