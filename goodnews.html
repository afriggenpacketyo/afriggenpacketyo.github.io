          <p>Top mathematician Shing-Tung Yau stated that mathematics plays a crucial role in the development of advanced weapons, following China's military parade in Tiananmen Square. Yau emphasized that a strong foundation in basic sciences is essential for a country to avoid being constrained by others in technology. The parade showcased China's latest arsenal of AI-powered vehicles, laser weapons, and information warfare equipment. Yau's comments underscore the strategic importance of mathematics and physics in modern warfare and technological advancement. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine supplements, popular among athletes, are gaining attention for potential benefits beyond muscle growth, including cognitive enhancement and blood sugar regulation. Research supports creatine's effectiveness in increasing lean muscle mass and improving athletic performance, particularly when combined with resistance training. While some studies suggest benefits for bone health and brain function, the evidence is still emerging. Experts recommend creatine monohydrate supplements certified by a third-party and advise consulting a doctor before use, especially for individuals with kidney disease. The overall consensus indicates that creatine is a low-risk supplement that may offer modest performance improvements, especially for vegans and vegetarians. </p>

          <p>A young bald eagle, exhibiting similarities to internet-famous eaglet Gizmo, visited the nest of bald eagle couple Jackie and Shadow in Big Bear. The juvenile eagle, with a dark tail and unique mouth shape like Gizmo, spent time in the couple's roost tree and nest. This visit is unusual for an eagle of nearly six months, as eaglets typically return to the nest only for a few weeks after their first flight. This event marks a peaceful moment after a nesting season filled with both joy and sorrow, including the loss of one eaglet during a storm. </p>

          <p>Elizabeth Gilbert, author of "Eat, Pray, Love," discusses her journey of recovery from sex and love addiction following the death of her partner, Rayya Elias. Gilbert realized she used romantic and sexual partners as a means of stimulation and sedation, constantly seeking external validation. Through recovery, she learned to build a healthy relationship with herself, taking accountability for her life and finding contentment in solitude. Gilbert now prioritizes self-care, creativity, and friendships, emphasizing that true fulfillment comes from within rather than relying on external relationships. </p>

          <p>The prevalence of students using AI to cheat is a growing concern, but research suggests that AI has changed the method rather than the amount of cheating. Studies indicate that cheating has been prevalent long before the advent of AI, with various factors influencing student behavior. As AI becomes more integrated into education, it is essential to unpack our understanding of cheating and how kids are using AI in school. There is a call for new skills in a world of AI, such as knowing when to strategically choose automation or evaluating trustworthiness of information from AI. </p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka's remarkable consistency in Grand Slam tournaments is tested as she enters another US Open semi-final against Jessica Pegula. Despite her powerful style and frequent semi-final appearances, Sabalenka's tendency to lose control in critical moments has limited her title wins. To overcome this, she has enlisted Max Mirnyi to her team, who emphasizes the importance of managing emotional ups and downs. Sabalenka's recent success in tie-break situations and a walkover in the quarter-finals may provide an advantage. </p>
