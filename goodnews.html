          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 16:36:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has spoken out about the recent trend of devaluing running backs' contracts in the NFL. He suggests that a few high-profile injuries to running backs who signed large deals created a narrative that teams used to suppress salaries for the position. Barkley argues that this justification is a tactic by owners and general managers to acquire elite talent at a lower cost. He contrasts this with how other positions, like wide receivers, are often signed to large contracts into their 30s without similar scrutiny if their performance declines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the DEA to reclassify psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in 'magic mushrooms.' Currently a Schedule I drug, the most restrictive category, it could be moved to Schedule II, acknowledging its potential medical value while still recognizing risks. This potential shift follows years of research suggesting psilocybin's benefits in treating mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. While advocates and some officials support expanded access for therapeutic use, some medical experts urge caution, citing a need for more high-quality studies.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the North Carolina coastline after bringing tropical storm conditions and significant storm surge to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., authorities are warning of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast for the remainder of the week. Evacuation orders were issued for parts of the Outer Banks due to the danger of coastal flooding. The storm is forecast to weaken and become post-tropical by the weekend as it moves toward Atlantic Canada.</p>

Observers are closely watching for any signals regarding future interest rate decisions, especially with recent data showing a slowdown in job growth alongside rising inflation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, debt forgiveness programs offer a potential solution for some struggling borrowers, but qualification is specific. Typically, candidates must have substantial unsecured debt, often over $7,500, and be experiencing verifiable financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency. Borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are also more likely to qualify, as creditors become more willing to negotiate a settlement to avoid a total loss. These programs can provide significant relief but may negatively impact a person's credit score. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New York Appeals Court Overturns Over $500 Million Fine in Trump Civil Fraud Case</h2>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in the civil fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million, was an "excessive fine" that violated the U.S. Constitution. However, the ruling upheld the underlying finding that Trump and other defendants committed business fraud by inflating asset values. The non-monetary sanctions, such as the installation of an independent monitor, were also upheld by the court.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that approximately 44% of American adults are now ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations behind this trend are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes. This shift in consumer behavior comes as many people are cutting back on dining out due to economic pressures. Restaurants' kids' meals typically offer simpler fare at a lower price point, making them an attractive option for budget-conscious adults or those seeking to manage their food intake, reflecting a broader adaptation to rising costs.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and digital services, is creating a surge in demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and HVAC technicians. However, the supply of these workers is dwindling as older generations retire and fewer young people enter the trades. This labor shortage poses a significant challenge for industries that rely on this expertise, with projections indicating hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs. To address the gap, some companies are turning to technology for efficiency, while trade unions are increasing recruitment efforts for apprenticeship programs.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's threats of tariffs to encourage domestic drug production, the timeline and complexity of building new pharmaceutical plants in the U.S. present significant hurdles. A new Fujifilm facility in North Carolina, which took five years and over $3 billion to develop, illustrates the long-term investment required for such projects. While some drugmakers like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson are increasing their U.S. manufacturing footprint, the process is slow due to high-tech requirements and rigorous regulatory approvals. This makes a rapid shift in the global pharmaceutical supply chain difficult to achieve. (not investment advice)</p>
