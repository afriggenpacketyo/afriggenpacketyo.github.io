          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he claims includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and significant Indonesian purchases of U.S. goods, including energy and Boeing jets. The deal would reportedly grant U.S. companies full market access with no tariffs on their exports to the Southeast Asian nation. However, Indonesian officials have not yet confirmed these terms, creating uncertainty around the agreement's finality. This follows a similar pattern to a recent trade announcement with Vietnam, where official confirmation has been slow to materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A procedural vote on key cryptocurrency legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, initially failed in the House after thirteen Republicans voted with Democrats to block it. Following the unexpected setback, President Trump met with eleven of the holdouts at the White House. He later announced that they had all agreed to reverse their position and would vote to advance the bill. This quick reversal highlights the president's significant influence over the Republican conference and revived the legislative push during the House's "Crypto Week." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to foster a new artificial intelligence economy. The investments will fund projects like AI-powering data centers and an energy innovation training center, aiming to leverage the state's energy resources and tech sector. The initiative, highlighted by Senator Dave McCormick and attended by Governor Josh Shapiro, is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. The event also drew protests, leading to police using pepper spray on demonstrators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, which began over a month ago amid protests. The Trump administration had federalized the troops against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom to protect federal property and immigration agents. Newsom responded to the partial withdrawal by calling for the remaining troops to also be returned to state control. The deployment had sparked a legal battle and was criticized by local leaders as an unnecessary political move that could escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>The House is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan Senate-passed bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue that by reducing the price volatility seen in other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions. The legislation would create consumer protections and define rules for banks and other institutions to issue their own stablecoins. This legislative push is part of a broader effort by the administration to support the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article for the Communist Party's main theoretical journal, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's commitment to economic globalization and free trade. He spoke out against rising unilateralism and protectionism, explicitly opposing the use of "unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure." The publication coincides with the opening of a major supply chain expo in China. This messaging positions China as a defender of the established global trade system, in contrast to the more protectionist policies being pursued by some Western nations, including the United States.</p>

          <p>A People's Daily article has urged local governments in China to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece highlights that since legal drafting authority was expanded to more cities in 2015, tailored local laws have become crucial tools for governance. It argues that creating stable, open legal frameworks allows market entities to operate effectively. This signals a top-down encouragement for localities to shift from relying on direct administrative orders to using the rule of law to manage economic issues and adapt to development needs.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort, marine scientists are crossbreeding resilient Elkhorn coral from Honduras with Florida's native population to help restore the state's devastated reefs. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical reef-building species, has been lost to warming oceans and disease. By introducing genetic diversity from the tougher Honduran corals, scientists hope the new "Flonduran" hybrids will be better able to survive future marine heatwaves. The first of these crossbred corals were recently planted off the Miami coast, a crucial step in protecting Florida's coastline from storm surge.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms, including an all-gold "Charger Power" look and a navy blue "Super Chargers" throwback. The gold uniforms, which will debut in October, have drawn mixed reactions online, with comparisons ranging from the Minions to a mustard bottle. The navy blue set is a modern take on the uniforms worn during the team's only Super Bowl appearance in the 1994 season. The team also announced it will now have the option to pair its regular powder blue jerseys with matching powder blue pants.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to use local currency, preserving foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar, and often acquire the gold at a discount. The trend, adopted by countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines, also supports the domestic mining industry. This shift is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire by central banks to bolster their reserves amid global geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants" to prevent confusion with doctors. The review, commissioned amid safety concerns, also suggests they should not diagnose patients and must wear standardized uniforms and badges for clarity. The recommendations follow cases where patients died after being seen by PAs they believed were doctors. The number of PAs and AAs is planned to grow significantly, making role clarity a critical issue.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. Opened in 1848, the Victorian glasshouse's ironwork is rusting due to the internal tropical conditions. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the structure, and moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.</p>

The advert for the drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, was found to breach rules regarding marketing food with unproven health benefits. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" wrongly implied the drink could treat anxiety, a prohibited claim.

          <p>Forty-six years after his execution, South Korea's former spy chief Kim Jae-gyu is being retried for the 1979 assassination of authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim, who was a longtime friend of the president, was convicted of insurrection, but his family argues he acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy. The retrial was granted based on evidence that Kim was tortured during the original investigation, which was conducted under martial law. The case re-examines a pivotal, and still polarizing, moment in the nation's history, forcing a reflection on dictatorship.</p>
