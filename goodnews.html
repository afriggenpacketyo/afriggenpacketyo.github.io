          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in harvesting "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, known for producing these Japanese plums believed to bring good luck in the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, carefully hand-picked the plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. The harvested plums will be pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, and drinking tea made from them on New Year's Day is thought to promote good health and ward off illness. The scouts expressed their enjoyment in contributing to this tradition.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has committed the UK to spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. The funds will be split, with 3.5% allocated to core defense and 1.5% to defense-related areas like resilience and security. This pledge aims to satisfy US President Trump's call for increased defense spending among NATO allies while offering EU countries flexibility in meeting the target. The government's National Security Strategy emphasizes the need for the UK to be more competitive in science, education, trade, and technology, promising new jobs and economic benefits for working people.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering requiring Google to make changes to its search services to ensure greater competition. The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes if a firm holds too much power in a market. Potential changes include "choice" screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers whose content appears in search results. While the CMA is not accusing Google of anti-competitive practices at this time, the investigation aims to promote a more open, competitive, and innovative online search market in the UK.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and foster political integration on the continent. The alliance functions as a collective security organization, providing mutual defense through military and political means if a member state is threatened. Article 5 of the NATO charter, the collective defense clause, states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all, prompting a collective response. The article has only been invoked once, by the United States after the 9/11 attacks, and the organization continues to evolve its role in response to contemporary security challenges.</p>

The markets are exhibiting signs of desensitization to policy changes, with limited reactions to the recent events. This is partly attributed to the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, which left no reported casualties.

She has garnered support from ministers and Prime Minister Starmer, who was unaware that such a law did not exist, and she also discussed her campaign with Queen Camilla. Fleet's personal experience drives her advocacy for protecting children and ensuring that sexual offenders do not have lifelong access to their victims through parental rights.</p>
