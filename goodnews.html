          <h2>Chinese Energy Investments in Africa Increasingly Focused on Renewables</h2>

          <p>A report by ODI Global indicates that China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power now constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with a significant portion directed towards renewable energy. The continent has also become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, experiencing a 153% surge in exports between 2020 and 2024, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This shift aligns with global trends as China committed to halting the funding of new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021.</p>

          <p>Three Chinese nationals have been arrested in Tokyo for allegedly running an illicit poker gambling den, suspected of earning over 60 million yen ($413,000) in less than a year. The suspects, including a 42-year-old resident of Tokyo's Kita Ward, are accused of collecting fees from patrons at a condominium in Toshima Ward. Police also arrested nine patrons for allegedly engaging in illegal gambling at the apartment, suspecting the operators received 5 percent of winnings as a fee, hosting around a dozen players per day. While one suspect admitted to the charge, the others claimed they were simply playing poker with friends.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems and are constantly bombarded with messages that they are not doing enough. She emphasizes that being a perfect mother is harmful and that flaws are an important part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to stop wondering if they are good enough, asserting that they already are. She highlights the historical tendency in psychiatry to blame mothers and urges for a shift in perspective to recognize and appreciate the contributions of mothers.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership believed Han had a better chance of winning the elections, but PPP members voted against the motion to switch candidates. Kim, a former labor activist, expressed his commitment to overcoming the current crisis facing the nation and leading South Korea towards becoming a greater nation. The PPP has been in turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the opposition Democratic Party's candidate, Lee Jae-myung, is currently leading in the polls.</p>

He loves the technology, power, and smooth driving experience of the Shark, which he finds far superior to his old VW Amarok. He also appreciates the low running costs due to his solar panels and the power outlets for tools. However, Dopson is concerned about the resale value of the Shark due to the rapid advancements in EV technology and the emergence of new competitors.

          <p>Sany Heavy Industry, a major Chinese heavy equipment manufacturer, plans to utilize up to US$1.5 billion from a proposed Hong Kong IPO to support global expansion. The company aims to double its overseas revenue to 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion) in the next three years, focusing on developing countries in Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa. Overseas revenue in 2024 rose 12 per cent year on year to 48.51 billion yuan, representing nearly 65 per cent of Sany's total revenue. The company will focus on building localized marketing channels rather than constructing new factories.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has begun redeveloping a two-kilometer expressway encircling the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, scheduled for completion by the 2040s. The Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the Tokyo Expressway, commonly known as the "KK Line," and is modeled after New York City's High Line. The walkway will include soil, trees, flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, event spaces, cafes, and food trucks. The project faces challenges such as heat countermeasures and structural integrity, with costs estimated at 14 billion yen ($97 million).</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Winning Streak Against Cy Young Winners Ends in Loss to Diamondbacks</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' perfect record against former Cy Young Award winners ended with a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a strong pitching performance from Dustin May. Corbin Burnes, the Diamondbacks' pitcher, threw seven shutout innings, limiting the Dodgers' offense. The loss highlighted a troubling trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records, going 3-8 in those contests since an 8-0 start to the season. The team will need a win on Sunday to avoid dropping a fourth-straight series against teams above .500.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising global uncertainties and trade tensions, Chinese consumers are increasingly choosing domestic brands as a reflection of national pride and cultural identity. This trend is driven by a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation and creativity on the global stage. This shift underscores the evolving nature of consumption in China, which is no longer solely based on practical needs but has become an emotional and cultural act. Market data supports this trend, with preference for domestic brands surging in sectors such as technology, fashion, and consumer goods.</p>
