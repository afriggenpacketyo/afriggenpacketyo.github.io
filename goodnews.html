          <p>Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is strategically expanding into the U.S. market by launching USAT, a new token specifically designed for American institutions and regulated under the GENIUS Act. This move is underscored by the appointment of Bo Hines, a former White House advisor, as CEO of Tether U.S., highlighting the company's commitment to regulatory engagement. USAT will be issued by Anchorage Digital and its reserves managed by Cantor Fitzgerald, aiming to integrate digital assets more deeply into the U.S. financial system. This initiative, which aligns with the goal of strengthening the U.S. dollar's digital dominance, represents a significant step for Tether's global presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched a new pilot program to accelerate the rollout of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis, with leading companies Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation participating. This initiative involves establishing at least five public-private partnerships with state and local governments to promote the safe usage of these advanced aircraft. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted the program's role in securing America's global leadership in transportation innovation. These efforts, spurred by a recent executive order from President Donald Trump, aim to bring supervised air taxi trials to the U.S. as early as next year, promising reduced emissions and eased traffic congestion.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is strategically buying an additional 80 shares of Boeing at approximately $217, aiming to increase its portfolio weighting to 1.4%. This decision capitalizes on a recent stock dip, which occurred after CEO Kelly Ortberg announced delays in the 777x certification process. The Trust views these delays as short-term buying opportunities, asserting that they will not fundamentally alter Boeing's long-term cash flow trajectory or its crucial role in trade discussions. The article highlights Boeing's improving balance sheet and evolving corporate culture, suggesting a positive turnaround is underway despite temporary challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Arriving by train, the Duke of Sussex expressed his commitment to doing "everything possible" to aid the recovery of injured military personnel and humanize their experiences. This marks his first visit to the capital, following a trip to Lviv in April, and comes as his Invictus Games Foundation continues its support for wounded veterans. His charitable foundation, Archewell, recently donated $500,000 to projects supporting injured children in Ukraine and Gaza, underscoring broader royal family support for Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Weight-Loss Drug Boom Reshapes Apparel Industry with 'Ozempic Effect'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 10:45:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is creating a noticeable "Ozempic effect" in the apparel industry, as evidenced by a surge in larger sizes at resale stores. Historically, larger sizes were in high demand, but now stores are seeing an abundance, while demand for smaller sizes increases. Retailers are reportedly adjusting inventory, with fewer extended sizes on racks and more online-only options. While the shift is primarily within the larger size range, experts warn against under-serving the plus-size market, which remains substantial. The long-term impact on manufacturing and pricing hinges on the drugs' continued accessibility and sustained demand.</p>

          <p>British-Belarusian dual citizen Julia Fenner, wife of a British diplomat, has been freed from prison in Belarus as part of a broader prisoner release deal negotiated by the U.S. with authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Fenner, who was given a long jail term after being detained in March 2024, was among 52 political prisoners released in exchange for the U.S. relieving some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia. UK Europe Minister Stephen Doughty lauded the release as a "significant breakthrough," though Belarus's exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya noted that over 1,000 political prisoners remain, describing the release as "forced deportation."</p>

          <p>The UK House of Lords has begun a two-day debate on the Assisted Dying Bill, marked by emotional personal testimonies from peers. Lord Charlie Falconer, the bill's sponsor, argued the current law causes "terrible suffering" and lacks compassion, urging the Lords to scrutinize rather than frustrate the Commons-passed legislation. Supporters, like Lord Forsyth of Drumlean and Lord Michael Dobbs, shared experiences of family members dying in agony, advocating for individual choice. Conversely, former Prime Minister Theresa May raised concerns about insufficient safeguards, the risk of normalizing suicide, and potential pressure on vulnerable individuals, warning of a "license to kill Bill" and blurring lines with euthanasia.</p>

          <p>Multifamily offices, representing high-net-worth investors, are increasingly directing capital into alternative investments, with commercial real estate (CRE) being a top priority. This model allows wealthy families to pool resources, share expertise, and access larger deals that might be out of reach individually, as exemplified by platforms like Realm. Travis King, Realm's CEO, notes that while institutions have significantly increased their CRE allocations, family offices are now seeking similar diversification. The article highlights opportunities in the office sector, where pricing has potentially bottomed out, while generally avoiding broad, over-invested categories like large-scale data centers, and notes that lower interest rates would boost transaction volume.
