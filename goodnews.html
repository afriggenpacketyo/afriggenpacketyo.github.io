          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. The judge determined that the protests, while containing inexcusable incidents, were not "significantly violent or disruptive" enough to justify the deployment without the state governor's approval, asserting Trump's claims were "untethered to the facts." This significant decision reinforces the constitutional principle of limiting federal military power in civil affairs and protects state sovereignty. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, celebrated the ruling, calling it a "wake-up call" for the Trump administration and emphasizing that local law enforcement is capable of maintaining peace.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers demonstrated remarkable resilience by staging a dramatic 5-3 comeback win against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. After falling behind 3-0 early in the second inning, Shohei Ohtani recovered to pitch six strong innings, allowing no further damage. The Dodgers' offense then steadily chipped away at the lead, culminating in Kiké Hernández's two-run double in the sixth. Teoscar Hernández delivered the decisive blow with a stadium-silencing, two-out, three-run home run in the seventh inning, securing an unexpected 1-0 series lead. This victory highlights the team's championship-winning composure and ability to perform under pressure.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 20:26:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Long queues, traditionally viewed as an inconvenience, are transforming into a popular social and experiential activity, particularly within British culture. People are increasingly willing to wait for hours, often overnight, for events such as new store openings, driven by the excitement, sense of camaraderie, and exclusivity of being among the first. Psychologists attribute this trend to the "anticipation" of a desired reward, which triggers dopamine release and fosters a feeling of shared experience. Brands are actively capitalizing on this by employing experiential marketing strategies, offering unique in-store experiences, complimentary gifts, and opportunities for social media content, effectively turning the act of queuing into an engaging and sought-after event for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest U.S. Lutheran denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a significant milestone. This event represents a move towards greater diversity within the predominantly white church, historically associated with Scandinavian and German roots. Curry, 53, who transitioned from Catholicism and public education to Lutheran ministry, aims to foster a more connected and welcoming church body. His leadership is anticipated to elevate the contributions of African Americans to Lutheranism globally and address ongoing challenges such as declining membership and theological debates over LGBTQ+ inclusion, reinforcing the denomination's commitment to evolving inclusivity.</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport in Lithuania was forced to temporarily close its airspace during the early hours of Sunday due to the suspected presence of unidentified balloons, leading to the redirection of several flights. This incident, which initially closed the airspace for a few hours, marks the latest in a series of European airport disruptions attributed to drone or balloon sightings, though the specific origin of these balloons remains unknown. Lithuania, a NATO member and strong supporter of Ukraine, had previously established a no-fly zone along its 679-km border with Belarus following earlier drone incursions. The event underscores persistent airspace security challenges and regional tensions, particularly given Vilnius's proximity to the Belarusian border.</p>

          <p>The previously winless UCLA football team achieved a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, marking a dramatic turnaround for their season. Interim playcaller Jerry Neuheisel, elevated just four days before the game, orchestrated an effective offensive strategy that saw the Bruins score on their first five drives. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a standout performance, accounting for five touchdowns—three rushing and two passing—and accumulating 128 rushing yards, including a nifty 52-yard gain. This unexpected win, which ended a four-game losing streak and defied all expectations, brought immense relief and celebration to the team and fans, potentially serving as a significant turning point in what had been a lost season.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Why University Students Frequently Contract 'Freshers' Flu'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," a collective term for various common cold viruses, rapidly spreads among university students due to a convergence of environmental and lifestyle factors. Thousands of students from diverse geographical locations gather in close quarters, such as packed lecture halls and shared kitchens, exposing them to a wide array of respiratory viruses their immune systems haven't previously encountered. Immunologists highlight that students' immune responses are often weakened by the typical freshers' week activities, including late nights, poor dietary habits, high stress levels, and insufficient sleep. This combination creates a highly susceptible population, making the illness hard to dodge. While generally not serious, symptoms can linger, and experts emphasize the importance of rest for recovery.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) holds a dominant position in the advanced processor market, generating 60% of its sales from cutting-edge 3nm and 5nm chips, and commanding an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced processors. The company has successfully pivoted its primary revenue driver from smartphones to high-performance computing, which now constitutes 60% of its sales, largely fueled by demand from North American AI technology giants. TSMC's established leadership in next-generation 2nm manufacturing further solidifies its competitive edge. This strategic positioning makes it a crucial player poised to benefit significantly from the projected multi-trillion-dollar investment in AI data center infrastructure over the coming years.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking a Trump administration initiative that sought to transfer unaccompanied immigrant children to adult detention centers once they turn 18. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that this policy directly violates a previous 2021 court order, which mandated that these individuals be released to the "least restrictive setting available" unless deemed a danger or flight risk. This ruling contributes to a series of legal battles against the administration's controversial immigration policies, which also reportedly include offering $2,500 stipends for voluntary self-deportation and renewed accusations of family separations. Immigration advocates contend these measures coerce vulnerable youth into relinquishing their legal protections and returning to unsafe conditions.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has achieved her long-held ambition by being elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on its 70th anniversary, placing her on course to become the country's first female prime minister. A staunch conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has held senior government roles and aims to revive "Abenomics" with high public spending and cheap borrowing. While known for her conservative views on traditional family structures, she has recently softened her stance, proposing policies to expand women's health services and improve childcare. Her historic victory, following two previous unsuccessful attempts, presents her with the challenge of leading a party grappling with voter trust and responding to a rising far-right.</p>

          <p>Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts have ignited title aspirations among their fervent fanbase after maintaining an unbeaten start to the season and securing a dramatic 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner. While head coach Derek McInnes cautions against premature title talk, he fully supports the fans' right to express excitement. This surging optimism is fueled by a substantial £10 million investment from owner Tony Bloom, who boldly predicted a challenge for second place this season, a prospect now appearing increasingly realistic. With rivals Rangers experiencing turmoil and Celtic yet to reach top form, supporters are enthusiastically embracing the club's stunning start, though some remain mindful of past late-season collapses.</p>
