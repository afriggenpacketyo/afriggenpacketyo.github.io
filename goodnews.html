          <p>The FBI has returned a stolen 16th-century document, signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, to the Mexican government. The manuscript page, penned in 1527, details payments for an expedition and is one of 15 pages believed to have been stolen from Mexico's national archives decades ago. It was located in the United States after the FBI's art crime team launched an investigation at Mexico's request. This act of cultural repatriation underscores ongoing cooperation between the two nations despite political tensions over other issues like trade and migration.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" branding deal, a move seen as a response to significant pressure from fans and human rights activists. The partnership drew criticism due to Rwanda's alleged funding of the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Instead of severing ties completely, Bayern will now focus on a football development partnership through its youth academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the original deal was a strategic move to expand into African markets, and the change reflects the powerful influence of fan sentiment in German football.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has developed a groundbreaking genomic tool that could revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of the disease. The technology, called "Uni-C," can analyze a patient's entire DNA from a few tumor cells in a blood sample in less than a day. This liquid biopsy method can decode multiple layers of genomic information, offering insights for early screening and personalized treatment. The speed and accuracy of the test promise to overcome the challenges posed by the scarcity of circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream.</p>

          <p>While 10,000 steps per day is a popular fitness goal, a comprehensive review of global data suggests that aiming for around 7,000 steps offers a more scientifically supported target for significant health benefits. Published in The Lancet, the study found that achieving 7,000 daily steps was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking only 2,000 steps. This step count was also linked to a reduced risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. Researchers note that while more steps are not harmful, the health returns diminish beyond this range.</p>

          <h2>UK Economic Growth Slows in Second Quarter but Exceeds Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 04:45:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the 0.7% expansion seen in the first quarter but better than the 0.1% forecast by economists. The services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest growth, while business investment and household spending saw declines. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "positive" but acknowledged more work is needed, while critics argue the pace of growth is too slow. Despite the better-than-expected performance, analysts express caution about maintaining this pace due to global economic weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, who faked his death and fled to Scotland to avoid prosecution, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a former girlfriend in Utah in 2008. The conviction followed a bizarre international manhunt that ended with his arrest in a Scottish hospital, where he claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight. Rossi was extradited to the U.S. earlier this year to face charges stemming from a DNA match on a decade-old sexual assault kit. He is scheduled to be sentenced in October and faces a separate trial for another sexual assault charge next month.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move aimed at bolstering Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts. Analysts suggest this action could have a positive side effect on China-U.S. relations, as the BLA has been responsible for fatal attacks targeting Chinese nationals and interests in the region. By targeting a mutual threat, the designation may create an opportunity for the two global powers to cooperate on counterterrorism through their shared partner, Pakistan, easing some of Beijing's long-held security concerns.</p>

          <p>BTECs are practical, career-focused qualifications in the UK, assessed through coursework, projects, and exams, and are available at levels equivalent to both GCSEs and A-levels. They serve as a popular route to university or direct employment in fields like health, science, and engineering. The Labour government recently reversed plans by the previous administration to scrap funding for 157 of these qualifications, preserving them alongside A-levels and the newer T-levels. This decision was welcomed by school leaders who argued that maintaining diverse post-16 educational pathways is crucial for meeting the needs of all students.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland have received their A-level results, which determine university admissions and future career paths. Grade boundaries, the minimum marks needed for each grade from A* to E, are set annually by exam boards and are now public. For students who did not get their desired grades, options include appealing through their school, considering a resit, or using the UCAS clearing process. Clearing matches students with university courses that still have available spaces and runs from July until late October.</p>

          <p>While Nvidia and AMD dominate the GPU market, Micron Technology is positioned to benefit significantly from the surge in AI infrastructure spending. The company produces high-bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions, which are critical for optimizing GPU performance and preventing data bottlenecks in AI data centers. The HBM market is projected to grow exponentially, and with only a few major players, Micron holds a strategic position. Despite its importance to the AI ecosystem, the article suggests Micron's stock is currently undervalued compared to its semiconductor peers, presenting a potential opportunity for investors.
