          <p>Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets has achieved a rare feat by winning both the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP and the Vezina Trophy as the league‚Äôs best goaltender, marking the first time a goalie has accomplished this since Carey Price in 2015. Hellebuyck led the Jets to the Presidents‚Äô Trophy for the best regular season and the William Jennings Trophy for the fewest goals allowed, although they lost in the second round of the playoffs to Dallas. Other award recipients include Nikita Kucherov, who won the Ted Lindsay Award, and Leon Draisaitl, who won the Rocket Richard Trophy.

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, especially with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining low. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, all eyes are on whether Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats, particularly as approval ratings for his Cabinet sometimes dip below the widely viewed "danger level" of 30 percent. Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, particularly those unaffiliated, and major issues at stake include rising living costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and regional concerns. Around 300 candidates are running in the election, making it the highest number of candidates in more than 30 years.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are increasingly focusing on overseas expansion to ensure their survival amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the United States. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to tariffs as high as 3,521 percent. To mitigate these challenges, Chinese firms are diversifying their production bases, with a significant portion of planned overseas capacity expansion directed towards the Middle East and Africa, followed by the U.S. and Europe. This strategic shift aims to localize production abroad, making exports viable despite high tariffs.</p>

          <p>LIV Golf star Patrick Reed made history at the U.S. Open by achieving an albatross, also known as a double eagle, a feat only accomplished by three other players in U.S. Open history. Reed's albatross occurred on the par-5 fourth hole at Oakmont Country Club, where he sank his second shot from 286 yards out. Despite the challenging conditions at Oakmont, with treacherous rough and glass-like greens, Reed's shot propelled him up the leaderboard. Other top golfers, including Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, struggled with the course's demanding conditions during the opening round.</p>

Thriston Lawrence of South Africa trails Spaun by one stroke, and Brooks Koepka is among those at two-under.

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for blood cancer, which delivers toxic drugs directly inside cancer cells. This therapy, known as belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt the progression of myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments, while also reducing side effects. The drug works by attaching a chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, allowing it to be absorbed by cancerous cells and release its toxic payload. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this therapy can halt the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with existing treatments, offering a significant improvement in patient outcomes.</p>

This move, reminiscent of his father's style, comes after Koizumi finished third in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, with analysts suggesting his communication skills and resemblance to his father could benefit the LDP in the upcoming national election. Koizumi has taken steps to release government stockpiled rice at reduced prices, drawing attention to controversial issues in the agricultural sector, and some analysts believe this could position him as a strong contender for future leadership.
