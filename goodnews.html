        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is heavily influenced by national political sentiment. A majority of "yes" voters cite opposition to the Trump administration and national Republicans as a key reason for their support. This group largely feels that the federal government treats California unfairly compared to other states. Conversely, those opposing the measure tend to view it as a state-level issue, expressing concerns about shifting power to urban areas and the financial cost. The poll suggests these national dynamics are currently giving the "yes" campaign a lead in the heavily Democratic state.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has announced a multi-year licensing deal with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, marking a first for a major sports league. The agreement provides the platforms with access to official NHL data and logos, while the league gains brand exposure and a suite of customer protections. The move is seen as a significant step for the burgeoning prediction market industry, which allows trading on the outcomes of various events and is regulated by the CFTC. However, the deal has drawn criticism from groups like the American Gaming Association, who argue these platforms amount to unregulated gambling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a wide-ranging discussion, filmmaker Ken Burns explores the competing narratives of the American Revolution, balancing its triumphal story of liberty with its tragic aspects of exclusion and hypocrisy. He argues for embracing the complexity of historical figures like George Washington and the unresolved contradictions of the era, which he believes still shape the nation's identity. Burns emphasizes that the Revolution was not just a fight for independence but also a bloody civil war and a world war, with profound consequences for enslaved people and Indigenous nations. He suggests that a clear-eyed view of this complicated past is essential for understanding contemporary America.</p>

          <p>Shares of GE Vernova saw a lift despite a wider market sell-off, following a report that its CEO has been in discussions with OpenAI's Sam Altman. While no deal has been announced, the talks suggest a potential partnership for OpenAI to secure electricity and power equipment, similar to its deals with chipmakers for computing power. This development provides a positive narrative for the energy company amid market concerns. Separately, Meta Platforms announced layoffs in its AI division and a new joint venture to finance a data center, signaling a strategic shift to de-risk its massive AI infrastructure spending.

          <h2>Homebuyers Face Dilemma of Locking Mortgage Rates Ahead of Anticipated Fed Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homebuyers and those looking to refinance are weighing the pros and cons of locking in current mortgage rates versus waiting for potential further drops. With the Federal Reserve expected to issue more rate cuts in late 2025, there is a chance for even lower rates, but this is not guaranteed. Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protects against unforeseen market spikes, which have occurred in the past even during periods of rate cuts. However, waiting could lead to additional savings, though unlocking a previously locked rate may incur a "float down" fee from the lender. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Western Alliance stated that an alleged loan fraud that caused a recent selloff in the regional bank's stock is believed to be an isolated issue. The bank had set aside $30 million for potential losses on a $98 million loan and sued the borrowers for alleged fraud related to collateral. CEO Kenneth Vecchione assured analysts that the bank has since reverified its major loan titles and found no other irregularities. The bank's third-quarter earnings did not reveal any new credit issues, helping to calm market fears about broader problems within its non-bank lending portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nia DaCosta's new film "Hedda" offers a vibrant and vicious modern take on Henrik Ibsen's 1891 play "Hedda Gabler," with Tessa Thompson delivering a marvelous performance in the title role. The adaptation cleverly shifts the setting to a single, debaucherous party in 1950s England, tightening the narrative and sharpening the character's rage against her constrained societal role. Thompson portrays Hedda as a clever, manipulative woman bored by her life, who takes out her frustrations by orchestrating chaos among her guests. The review praises the film's bold creative choices, including layering race and sexuality onto the original story, and its powerful, stylish execution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, there are specific rules and implications to understand. When both spouses are listed as co-borrowers and meet the age requirement of 62, they can remain in the home as long as one of them lives there and maintains it. The loan amount, however, is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which can result in access to a smaller amount of equity. This article outlines the process and advises couples to carefully weigh the benefits, like eliminating mortgage payments, against long-term implications for the surviving spouse.

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has confirmed that the league will not reconsider its choice of Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl halftime performer, despite backlash from Donald Trump and his supporters. Goodell stated the decision was "carefully thought through" and that criticism is common when selecting an artist for such a massive audience. He defended the choice by highlighting Bad Bunny's status as one of the world's most popular entertainers. The Puerto Rican artist, a vocal opponent of Trump, is expected to perform in Spanish, and Goodell expressed confidence that the show will be an "exciting and a united moment."</p>
