        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romania is holding a presidential election runoff after the initial vote was annulled due to irregularities, including alleged Russian interference. The previous election saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly leading in the first round. However, the constitutional court found issues with campaign financing and organization, leading to the annulment. Georgescu was subsequently banned from running in the rerun amidst investigations into the spread of pro-Georgescu messaging via social media, which prosecutors believe was part of a Russian hybrid attack, although Moscow denies any involvement. The runoff election will determine the country's next leader amid heightened political tensions.</p>

Smith was found in his home with a bullet lodged in his brain while his date, Leslie Reeves, was found dead. After undergoing brain surgery and being placed in a medically induced coma, Smith woke up with no memory of the shooting. Despite doctors' initial poor prognosis, Smith regained his strength through physical therapy, is back singing with his rock band, and proposed to his fianc√©e, Michelle Albrecht, and hopes to become a motivational speaker.</p>

          <p>Chris Smith, an Illinois man who was shot in the head, was found barely alive in his home alongside his dog, Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix. Tiki provided warmth to Smith during the 12 hours before he was rescued, potentially saving his life. Smith had been on a first date with Leslie Reeves, who was found dead at the scene. Smith has no memory of the incident, but his friend Dennis Hobson, an EMT, recounted finding Tiki huddled with him. The article also mentions the conviction of Robert Tarr, an ex-boyfriend of Reeves, for murder and attempted murder in the case.</p>

          <p>Germany and other EU countries are significantly increasing their military spending due to growing security concerns. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz aims to transform the Bundeswehr into the strongest conventional army in Europe, with plans to invest 5% of GDP in defense. France, the only EU state with a nuclear deterrent, is also increasing its defense budget. Poland is focused on developing the strongest land forces in Europe, while the UK is emphasizing high tech military advancements. Despite these investments, the global ranking of military strength is unlikely to change significantly in the medium term.</p>

The game also featured a strong performance from Angels catcher Logan O'Hoppe, who recorded a career-high five RBIs, and a three-run home run from Dodgers' Andy Pages.

          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of a new fiber-optic gyroscope that promises greater stability across a wide range of temperatures, potentially enhancing navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope uses changes in the movement of light within optical fibers to sense orientation and turning rates, making it a valuable component for inertial navigation systems. These systems are crucial for military and security applications because they do not rely on external signals like satellites, making them immune to interference.</p>

          <p>High demand for concerts and music festivals in mainland China and Hong Kong is driving a tourism spending spree. Fans are traveling across the country and from outside the region to attend live shows, leading local governments to bundle concert tickets with discounted accommodations and tourist attractions to boost domestic consumption. This trend aligns with Beijing's economic agenda to prioritize domestic consumption amid trade tensions. For example, tickets for comedian Jimmy O. Yang's shows in Hong Kong sold out quickly, while fans purchased travel packages that included airport transfers and guaranteed bookings.</p>

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes unpaid work is too lenient and wants to expand it by collaborating with councils and private companies. Offenders would not receive wages; instead, the money would go to a fund for victims' groups. This proposal aims to alleviate prison overcrowding and ensure that punishment is more than just a "slap on the wrist."</p>
