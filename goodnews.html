          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report that raised concerns about his mental acuity, months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from the interviews revealed Biden struggling to remember key dates and events, leading to questions about his fitness for office. Despite the report's findings, Biden asserted his competence and dismissed the need for Hur's recommendation. The report amplified Republican criticisms about Biden's mental fitness, while Democrats initially defended him before later calling for him to drop his re-election bid.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, reduced visibility to zero in some areas and disrupted travel, including a ground stop at Midway International Airport. Residents reported feeling the debris in their eyes as the dust storm blew through, creating an eerie and unprecedented scene. Skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes, marking a brief but impactful event.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's earlier announcement to shut down seven vehicle plants and reduce its global workforce by 20,000 jobs due to a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal year 2024. The plants under consideration are the Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant, which manufactures commercial vehicles, together accounting for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The final decision hinges on discussions with labor unions, parts suppliers, and local municipalities, while Nissan has already confirmed closures of overseas plants in India and Argentina.</p>
