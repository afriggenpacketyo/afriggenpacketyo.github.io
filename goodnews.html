          <p>Donald Trump is anticipated to announce a framework for a trade agreement with the UK, though specifics remain unclear and require Congressional approval. Discussions have involved lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as reducing taxes on US technology companies. However, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted lowering food production standards to facilitate trade of US agricultural products, prioritizing a separate agreement with the EU. A draft deal proposes reduced tariffs on British exports of steel, aluminum, and cars in exchange for a lower digital services tax.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has alarmed the British film industry, which is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes. British studios rely heavily on Hollywood blockbusters, and uncertainty about tariffs could reverse recent progress. The British government is in discussions with the US administration regarding the potential tariffs. Trade experts question the enforceability of film tariffs, given the increasingly international nature of film production, and suggest that increased American tax breaks are more likely.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie has been digitally reanimated to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro, using AI to create her likeness and a script based on her writings. While Christie's family supports the project and emphasizes that it uses her own words, ethicists raise concerns about consent and the potential for blurring the lines between reality and artificial representation. The use of AI to resurrect historical figures raises questions about authenticity and the ethics of speaking for the dead, even with the consent of their estate.</p>
