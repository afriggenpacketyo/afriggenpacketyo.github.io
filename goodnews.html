          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket has successfully launched a new international crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission, designated Crew-11, proceeded after a one-day delay due to unfavorable weather conditions. The crew, commanded by NASA's Zena Cardman, includes members from the U.S., Japan, and Russia, continuing international cooperation aboard the station. This launch is notable as Cardman and other crew members were reassigned to this flight following issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.</p>

          <p>A new application called Balance is using artificial intelligence to help parents monitor their children's mental health by analyzing their online habits and language patterns. Developed by security company Aura, the tool tracks a child's digital activity to detect anomalies that could signal stress or mood shifts, providing parents with reports to facilitate conversations. While some parents in a clinical study found it helpful for opening dialogue, critics argue that systemic change from lawmakers and tech companies is needed to truly protect children online.</p>

The session was less than ideal for the McLaren duo, as Norris made a mistake on his first fast lap and Piastri encountered heavy traffic. Meanwhile, four-time champion Max Verstappen struggled with his Red Bull car, finishing 14th and describing it as "undrivable." Verstappen is also under investigation by race stewards for allegedly throwing an object from his cockpit while on the track.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 reboot of "The Naked Gun," starring Liam Neeson, is reviewed as a welcome return to the genre of slapstick farce. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the film successfully casts Neeson in the deadpan comedic role of Frank Drebin Jr., a successor to Leslie Nielsen's iconic character. The article praises the movie for its commitment to a high joke-per-minute ratio and its refreshing, nonsensical fun amidst a landscape of serious summer blockbusters. The film's reliance on silly gags and one-liners is seen as a delightful throwback to a style of comedy that has become rare in modern cinema.</p>

          <p>The data analytics firm Palantir has been awarded a major contract with the U.S. Army, valued at up to $10 billion over the next decade. The agreement aims to streamline the military's software and data analysis capabilities by consolidating 75 separate contracts into a single enterprise deal. This contract solidifies Palantir's role in the U.S. government's push for greater efficiency through artificial intelligence, a key initiative of the Trump administration. The deal is expected to provide the Army with a comprehensive framework for its future technological needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Investigating the Effectiveness of Personal Neck Cooling Fans During Heatwaves</h2>

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common, personal neck cooling fans have grown in popularity as a way to stay comfortable. These devices, which look like horseshoes worn around the neck, blow air onto the head and neck, with some models featuring cooling metal plates. While users report feeling cooler, experts say the fans' actual ability to lower core body temperature is limited, especially in high humidity. They primarily work by enhancing the feeling of coolness on the skin's thermal receptors rather than providing significant physiological cooling, which could create a false sense of security.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Restrict Civil Service Internships to Students from Lower Socio-Economic Backgrounds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." The policy, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will also be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program, in a move aimed at improving social mobility within government.</p>
