          <p>Following an audit by Baroness Louise Casey into group-based child sexual abuse, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a full national statutory inquiry.  This decision comes after months of criticism for his perceived reluctance to establish such an inquiry. The inquiry, established under the Inquiries Act, will have the power to compel witnesses and is expected to take time to set up.  This follows recommendations from the Casey audit which highlighted the need for a national inquiry.</p>
