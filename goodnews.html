          <p>Villanova University officials have confirmed that a report of an active shooter at its law school was a "cruel hoax." The initial alert prompted a significant police response and a campus-wide lockdown, with students and staff instructed to shelter in place. Authorities, including local and federal law enforcement, conducted thorough sweeps of the campus buildings. Fortunately, no shooter, firearms, or injuries were found, bringing a sense of relief to the shaken community after the tense situation was resolved.</p>

          <p>China is seeking to amend its 1998 pricing law to address "involution," a term for destructive, cutthroat competition that has led to severe price wars in industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed revision, drafted by top economic regulators, aims to curb practices such as selling products at a loss simply to gain market share. A solar panel executive expressed support for the changes, noting that intense price-slashing in his highly homogenized industry has resulted in substantial losses for many companies, and that recent government calls to combat the issue have already led to a rebound in prices.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace experienced a bittersweet night, achieving a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League, marking their first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory atmosphere at Selhurst Park, however, was tinged with sadness as star midfielder Eberechi Eze was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's departure post-match, shifting focus to the need for new signings. The win represents a significant milestone for the club, which also recently won the FA Cup and Community Shield.</p>

          <p>In an unusual move, the MLS team Colorado Rapids is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their recently traded star player, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one. The offer coincides with the club's record acquisition of midfielder Paxten Aaronson, who will replace Mihailović. Mihailović requested a trade to Toronto FC for personal reasons, a surprising development given the team's successful season. The jersey swap program is a gesture by the club to acknowledge the unexpected nature of the trade and to help fans embrace a new chapter with their new star player.</p>

          <p>Workday, a provider of finance and HR software, reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. Despite the positive results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading as it issued guidance that was merely in line with estimates and highlighted specific challenges. CEO Carl Eschenbach noted pressure in the state and local government sectors due to funding slowdowns and in higher education, citing uncertainty created by the Trump administration's move to shut down the Department of Education.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has started to move northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions and dangerous storm surges to the Outer Banks, prompting some evacuations. The National Hurricane Center continues to warn of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast for the remainder of the week. The storm is forecast to gradually weaken and become a post-tropical system over the weekend.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Investors Increasingly Use ETF Conversions to Defer Capital Gains Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 17:06:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining popularity among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is publicly launched. This allows the investor to avoid triggering a taxable event until they eventually sell the ETF shares. While the strategy can be highly effective, it has strict diversification requirements and can be limiting, as the investor's capital becomes tied up in the specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a recommendation from the DEA to reclassify psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in "magic mushrooms." The proposal would move the substance from Schedule I, the most restrictive category, to the less restrictive Schedule II, which acknowledges medical value despite potential for abuse. This federal review follows years of stalled efforts at the state level to legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use. The move is supported by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and comes after a legal battle by a doctor seeking to use the substance in end-of-life care.</p>
