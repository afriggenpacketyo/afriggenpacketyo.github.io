          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analyst predictions. While AWS remains the market leader in cloud infrastructure, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates. The division remains a significant profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's larger market share and emphasized its commitment to security, contrasting AWS's performance with recent security issues faced by competitors.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, with President Trump stating it will be his 'gift to the country.' The project, intended to be completed before the end of his term, will be funded by the president and other 'patriot donors.' It will replace the current East Wing and provide a permanent venue for large-scale events, which currently require tents on the South Lawn. This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, reflecting the president's real estate background.</p>

          <p>Following design software company Figma's highly successful IPO, four major venture capital firms—Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia—are holding a combined $24 billion worth of stock. The company's shares soared 250% on their first day, valuing Figma at nearly $68 billion, more than triple the $20 billion Adobe had offered in a failed acquisition attempt. This event marks a significant positive turn for the tech IPO market, which has been stagnant for several years, providing a much-needed opportunity for venture firms to deliver returns to their investors.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the termination until a November hearing, providing a reprieve for individuals, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for over two decades. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson criticized the administration's actions, suggesting they were based on a 'preordained determination' rather than an objective review of conditions in those countries, which the government claims are now safe for return.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interspecies hybridization event involving a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, as its closest living wild relative does not produce starchy tubers. The research indicates that the ancient tomato provided a key gene for tuber formation, while the other species contributed a gene that controlled the growth of the underground stems. This finding illustrates how hybridization can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and species.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport has revealed a £49 billion plan for expansion, which includes a third runway, a new terminal, and significant upgrades to local transport infrastructure, including diverting the M25 motorway. The airport's CEO stated the expansion is 'urgent' to increase capacity and enhance the UK's global trade and connectivity, with the project to be funded by private finance. However, the proposal faces strong opposition from environmental groups, local residents, and London's mayor, who cite severe impacts on noise, air pollution, and climate change targets, setting the stage for a major political and regulatory battle.</p>

          <p>Apple reported a strong fiscal third quarter, with revenue growing 10% to $94.04 billion, its largest increase since late 2021, and beating analyst expectations. This robust performance, driven by record iPhone sales and a growing services division, comes as the company faces pressure to articulate a clear strategy for artificial intelligence. While CEO Tim Cook mentioned increased investment in AI, the lack of specific updates has left investors wanting more. The positive financial results buy the company more time to refine and deliver on its AI promises in a market heavily focused on the technology.</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be the first monument honoring an individual African American on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. The project, which received bipartisan support from state lawmakers, is seen as a step toward telling a more complete story of the state's history. The statue, being created by artist Basil Watson, will depict Smalls' journey from enslavement to a pioneering statesman, symbolizing his courage and his advocacy for civil rights and equality.</p>

          <p>Despite Amazon's stock falling after its latest earnings report, some analysts are reiterating a buy rating and viewing the dip as a buying opportunity. The company exceeded revenue and profit expectations, but a modest beat from its AWS cloud division and mixed guidance for the next quarter disappointed investors. The analysis argues that the long-term investment thesis remains intact, pointing to continued strong growth in high-margin areas like AWS and advertising. The focus remains on Amazon's ability to lower costs and expand margins, which are seen as key drivers for future stock appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy to make its main civil service internship scheme exclusively available to university students from 'lower socio-economic backgrounds.' This change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the number of working-class individuals in Whitehall to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. The decision is based on parental occupation, and successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. This move is part of a broader effort to diversify the civil service and locate more senior roles outside of London.</p>
