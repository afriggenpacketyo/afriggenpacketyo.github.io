          <p>Shares in the Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk saw a 3% increase after the company released new trial data for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy. The study indicated that Wegovy is more effective at reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes compared to rival drugs from Eli Lilly. This positive development comes amid intense competition in the lucrative market for weight management medications, with investors closely monitoring clinical data to assess the long-term potential of these treatments. The news contributed to a generally positive sentiment in European stock markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final stage of England's expanded childcare support program has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children from nine months old. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" to ease financial pressure on families, the rollout faces significant challenges. Nurseries are reporting severe staff shortages and long waiting lists, making it difficult for many parents to secure a place. The high demand highlights systemic issues within the childcare sector, including workforce retention and funding rates that providers say do not cover their full costs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's state-owned train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. The move, announced by First Minister John Swinney, is designed to make rail travel more affordable and encourage commuters to shift from cars to trains. This policy will result in significant savings for passengers, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow seeing ticket prices reduced by nearly 50%. A previous pilot of the scheme showed a modest increase in passenger numbers.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Power and the Palace," reports that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted indecent assault on a train when she was a teenager. According to the author, she successfully fought off her attacker with the heel of her shoe and ensured the man was arrested. This personal experience is detailed as sources close to the Queen note her extensive charity work supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The revelation is seen as potentially helping to destigmatize the issue, though sources clarify her advocacy stems from hearing many victims' stories over the years, not just this single incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within Xinjiang's Taklamakan Desert. Also known as Artemia, these resilient crustaceans are valuable in aquaculture as feed and also have applications in medicine and cosmetics. The discovery in the city of Aral suggests the region has favorable natural conditions for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. Researchers will now conduct laboratory studies to determine if it is a new species and explore its potential for developing a commercial aquaculture industry in the area.</p>

The result contrasts with the official government PMI, which reported a fifth consecutive month of contraction. The private survey suggests some resilience in external demand, though analysts remain cautious about weak domestic demand and the sustainability of the recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

While the talks promise to ease tensions, major obstacles remain, including unresolved border disputes and a large trade deficit favoring China. The article suggests India is pursuing a policy of "strategic autonomy," but this rapprochement with Beijing will create new challenges in its relationships with Western allies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The emergency ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared to transport the children from Texas. Immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit arguing the deportations would violate federal laws that protect vulnerable minors, who they say would be returned to danger without due process. The judge's order, which will last for 14 days, blocks the removal of any unaccompanied child who does not already have a formal deportation order.</p>
