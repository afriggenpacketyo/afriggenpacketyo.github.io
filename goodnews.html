          <h2>Scottie Scheffler's Open Victory Prompts Comparisons to Golfing Legends</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his dominant four-shot victory at The Open Championship, Scottie Scheffler is drawing comparisons to golf legends like Tiger Woods from his peers. Fellow golfers Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy praised his consistent excellence over the past few years, with Schauffele calling him a "tough man to beat." Scheffler has now won four major titles in three years, and his performance at Royal Portrush was characterized by a calm and composed demeanor that left little doubt about the outcome. This win further solidifies his status as the world's number one golfer and raises questions about how many major championships he may ultimately secure.</p>

          <p>Despite winning his fourth major title at The Open, Scottie Scheffler played down his achievements, stating he doesn't consider himself to be anything special. He emphasized that his family and faith are more important than his success in golf, which he says does not fulfill the deepest desires of his heart. Scheffler also dismissed comparisons to Tiger Woods as "silly," noting he is only a quarter of the way to Woods's major championship total. The 29-year-old celebrated the victory with his wife and 14-month-old son, Bennett, expressing hope that his son will one day enjoy the game of golf as much as he does.</p>
