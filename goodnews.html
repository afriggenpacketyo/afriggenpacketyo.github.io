          <p>Reports are asserting that the apparent romance between Pamela Anderson, 58, and Liam Neeson, 72, is genuine, countering widespread speculation that it was a publicity stunt for their new film, "The Naked Gun." Insiders told People magazine that the connection between the co-stars is real and that neither would participate in a fabricated relationship for promotional purposes. These claims contradict other reports alleging the relationship was orchestrated by their PR teams, noting the actors had not seen each other between the end of filming and the start of the press tour. The pair have playfully deflected direct questions about their relationship status.</p>

          <p>The Scottish women's rugby team has advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 2002 after defeating Fiji in a hard-fought match. Winger Francesca McGhie scored two tries, bringing her tournament total to five, while Rhona Lloyd also added a pair of scores. Despite a spirited effort from Fiji, who scored three tries of their own, Scotland's defense and a stunning individual try from Emma Orr secured the crucial victory. The win sets up a decisive Pool B match against Canada next weekend to determine the group winner.</p>

          <p>A baseball bat that led to a controversial suspension for a 12-year-old New Jersey Little Leaguer has been sold for nearly $10,000 at auction. Marco Rocco was initially suspended for flipping the bat to celebrate a home run, a decision that was later overturned by a judge following a legal challenge from his father. The incident gained national attention, with major league players voicing their support for the young player. All proceeds from the auction, which drew 68 bids, will be donated back to the Haddonfield Little League program.</p>

The show featured a blend of classical pieces from Bach and Handel with African drumming and diverse musical influences, including works by Philip Glass, Gershwin, and Ravel.

          <p>McLaren driver Oscar Piastri narrowly beat his teammate Lando Norris to claim pole position for the Dutch Grand Prix by just 0.012 seconds. The close qualifying session at Zandvoort saw both drivers set their fastest times on their initial laps in the final round. The result intensifies the championship battle between the two, with Piastri holding a nine-point lead. Red Bull's Max Verstappen qualified third for his home race, while Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls delivered an impressive performance to secure fourth place on the grid.</p>

The grand prize has been growing for 39 consecutive drawings without a winner, with the last billion-dollar jackpot being claimed in April 2024. The odds of matching all six numbers to win are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option, both of which are subject to significant federal and state taxes, with only eight states exempting lottery winnings from income tax.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, after severe drought caused water levels to recede in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The tombs, located in the Duhok province, likely date back to the Hellenistic period. While the prolonged drought has devastated agriculture, it has created an opportunity for excavation work in areas typically submerged. The archaeological team is working to excavate and move the artifacts to the Duhok Museum for preservation before the water levels rise again, highlighting the unexpected consequences of climate change in the historically rich region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, scientists at MIT have directly imaged a phenomenon known as "second sound," where heat travels as a wave through a superfluid quantum gas. Unlike in ordinary materials where heat dissipates, in these exotic, ultra-cold superfluids, heat can slosh back and forth without any visible movement of the fluid itself. Researchers developed a novel thermography technique using radio frequencies to track the temperature changes, finally confirming a long-held theory. This breakthrough could provide crucial insights into the physics of high-temperature superconductors and the dense matter within neutron stars.</p>

Conversely, Vance himself has floated a theory that the NFL might rig games for Kelce's team due to Swift's fame. The engagement is being interpreted through various lenses, from brand marketing opportunities to debates about feminism, highlighting the immense cultural space the couple occupies in modern America.</p>

The analysis considered factors like financial aid, academic quality, and post-graduation earnings, noting that while private schools have high sticker prices, generous aid can significantly lower costs. For example, Princeton students on financial aid pay an average of just over $10,000 annually and earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade later. Many top-ranked schools have adopted "no-loan" policies to make attendance more accessible. (not investment advice)</p>
