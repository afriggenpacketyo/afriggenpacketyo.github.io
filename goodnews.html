          <p>In the third one-day international match, Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century with 110 runs, helping England reach a formidable total of 414-5. Following this strong batting performance, fast bowler Jofra Archer took four wickets in a formidable opening spell, dismantling South Africa's batting lineup. South Africa was ultimately bowled out for just 72 runs, resulting in a record-breaking 342-run victory for England. Although the series was already lost, the win provided a significant morale boost for the English team.</p>

          <p>The Campbell Soup Company has announced it will eliminate all artificial colors from its extensive portfolio of food and beverage products by August 2026. This decision comes in response to a call from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for food manufacturers to remove synthetic dyes by 2027. Campbell's, which owns brands like V8 and Goldfish, plans to use natural sources like paprika and beet juice for coloring, a practice already in place for its Goldfish crackers. The company joins others like Nestle and Kraft Heinz in shifting away from synthetic ingredients.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. However, the race was marked by a controversial decision from the McLaren team, which ordered Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The order came after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a faulty wheel gun, dropped him behind Piastri. The team justified the decision by citing a previous race where Norris had similarly ceded a position, sparking debate about fairness and team strategy in the high-stakes championship fight.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Black Ferns delivered a powerful performance to defeat Ireland 40-0, securing the top spot in Pool C of the Women's Rugby World Cup. Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout player, scoring a hat-trick of tries in a ruthless display by the reigning champions. Despite a strong start from Ireland, New Zealand's class and execution proved overwhelming. Both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, but the decisive victory gives New Zealand a theoretically easier path forward and avenges a previous loss to Ireland.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound and vibrated for about ten seconds as part of the second nationwide test of the government's emergency alert system. The test, which occurred around 3:00 PM, was deemed a success by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who called it an important step in public safety. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events like severe weather or public health emergencies. While the test was largely successful, some users reported receiving garbled messages, and events like sporting matches paused to accommodate the alert.</p>

The driver was tracked to his home after the most recent sighting and was taken into custody while still wearing his racing suit and helmet. Previously, authorities were unable to identify the driver because of the helmet.

The boat was created by cultivating a network of wild Ganoderma polychromum mycelium on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption for purchases under $800 is causing concern for some small businesses that rely on international goods. However, this article argues that the panic may be misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The larger economic picture, including a strong labor market and high middle-class net worth, suggests the economy can likely absorb the resulting price increases. The focus, it suggests, should be on overall economic health rather than the specific impact of this tariff change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States has found a consistent pattern of couples sharing the same mental health diagnoses. This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," was observed across multiple generations from the 1930s to the 1990s for disorders like depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. The trend suggests that people with similar psychiatric challenges tend to form partnerships. Researchers theorize this could be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the limiting effects of social stigma on dating prospects.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do for their child's long-term development. Consistent, deep sleep is essential for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional growth and is linked to better concentration and emotional regulation later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped. He stresses that while routines are helpful, flexibility is key to reducing parental stress.</p>
