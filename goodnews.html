          <p>SoftBank's shares surged 13% after announcing a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB, expanding its footprint in artificial intelligence. This acquisition aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence, which he believes will propel humanity forward. The deal means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. This article also briefly mentions HSBC's proposal to privatize Hang Seng Bank, indicating broader market activity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hang Seng Bank shares surged by nearly 30% following an announcement that its parent company, HSBC, plans to take it private in a deal valuing the lender at over $37 billion. HSBC aims to acquire the remaining 37% of Hang Seng Bank, offering a 33% premium on its recent share price. This move is part of HSBC's strategy to strengthen its banking presence in Hong Kong and the broader Asia-Pacific region. Analysts view the privatization as a positive, long-overdue step to address governance issues associated with parent-subsidiary double listings, despite Hang Seng Bank's recent uptick in bad loans.

The IDF has been instructed to prepare strong defenses and for any scenario, while Hamas submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners for release. This initial agreement focuses on immediate steps, with more contentious issues like Gaza's governance and Hamas disarmament still needing negotiation. The announcement sparks cautious optimism, though previous multi-phase agreements have faltered.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta after a brief standoff. His arrest concludes a months-long, multi-agency manhunt that followed the mass jailbreak through a hole behind a toilet. Groves, a convicted murderer facing life imprisonment, was found in a crawl space and taken into custody without incident. Officials praised the collaboration of law enforcement agencies, and Groves is expected to be extradited to Louisiana to face additional charges for the escape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan, now in its "first phase" of agreement, outlines a roadmap for ending the Israel-Hamas war. Key provisions include an immediate ceasefire, the release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed line. The plan proposes a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" to govern Gaza, overseen by an "International Stabilization Force," and calls for Gaza's demilitarization. While it acknowledges Palestinian statehood as an aspiration, it doesn't provide a clear path.</p>

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff transformed Brooklyn's Middle School 50 from a "persistently dangerous" and failing institution into a national debate champion by integrating debate into every class. A decade ago, the school had drastically declined in enrollment and test scores. Honoroff, a former debate coach, expanded the debate team, leading to a third of students enrolling. This innovative approach significantly improved proficiency scores, with English jumping to 60% and math to 70%. The school's debate team recently won the national championship, showcasing the profound impact of this educational initiative.</p>

The storm's center is expected to move parallel to the coast, remaining offshore, and further weakening is forecast over the next 48 hours. Forecasters warn of life-threatening surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, expressed skepticism in a case where a Republican candidate, Rep. Michael Bost, sued over Illinois' ballot counting regulations despite winning his election. Bost's lawyer argued harm due to a lowered margin of victory and extended staffing costs. However, justices questioned the standing of a winning candidate to challenge election rules, with Chief Justice Roberts noting the argument boiled down to "I'm a candidate. These rules apply to me, and I'm suing." The case highlights complex legal questions about electoral challenges.</p>
