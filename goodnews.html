          <p>Fire departments are increasingly using artificial intelligence to detect and respond to wildfires more quickly. In Aspen, Colorado, AI-powered cameras provide a 360-degree view of the landscape, detecting smoke before 911 calls are even made. The system alerts fire officials with the exact location and weather data, enabling a faster response. Aspen Fire was the first department to adopt this technology, which is now used across 10 states to improve wildfire response and coordination.</p>
