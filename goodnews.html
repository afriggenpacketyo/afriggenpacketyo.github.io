          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing during a mission over Germany in 1944, has received his long-lost Zippo lighter. The inscribed lighter was discovered after a relative saw it in a Facebook post from a Swiss collector's group. With help from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the family retrieved the artifact, leading to an emotional moment for the airman's 95-year-old sister, who clutched it as if hugging the brother she lost 81 years ago.</p>

          <p>A new CNBC study has ranked the best U.S. states for workers, placing Texas at the top due to its large talent pool, high concentration of career-focused high school students, and strong worker productivity. Florida and Georgia followed in the rankings, which were based on factors like educational attainment, STEM job concentration, and state training programs. The report suggests that while the national labor shortage has eased, workforce quality remains a critical factor for business competitiveness across the country.</p>

          <h2>Five Strategies to Remove Medical Debt from Credit Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 12:36:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a court decision to strike down a rule that would have automatically removed medical debt from credit reports, this article outlines five effective strategies for consumers to manage the issue. The methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating settlements directly with collection agencies, and seeking assistance from hospital charity care programs. Since policies from the major credit bureaus already require the removal of paid medical debts and those under $500, consumers are advised to actively monitor their reports for inaccuracies.</p>

He highlighted the company's record-breaking first-quarter box office revenue and strong growth in international markets, particularly with local language films. With major upcoming movies designed for the format and new partnerships with streamers like Netflix and Apple, Cramer sees significant growth potential for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan also earmarks 35% for climate projects, €100 billion for Ukraine, and triples funding for migration management. It aims to raise funds through new revenue streams to avoid increasing member state contributions, but the proposal faces hurdles, as it requires unanimous approval and has already been called "too high" by the Netherlands.</p>

He highlighted a key message in the film: if Superman can show compassion to his nemesis, people can extend that same kindness to neighbors with different beliefs.</p>
