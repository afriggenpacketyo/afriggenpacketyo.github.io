          <h2>Los Angeles Considers Significant Wage Hike for Residential Construction Workers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 17:11:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a motion to study implementing a minimum wage exceeding $32 an hour for residential construction workers on projects with ten or more units. This significant proposal also includes an additional $7.65 per hour for healthcare benefits. Proponents argue that these wage and benefit increases are essential to attract and retain workers, particularly as the city faces pressure to rebuild after the Palisades fire and the industry grapples with labor shortages exacerbated by fears of immigration raids. A coalition of construction unions and housing advocacy groups supports the initiative, emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable non-union and foreign-born workers from exploitation and wage theft.</p>

          <p>Nike reported an unexpected 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, surpassing market expectations, yet simultaneously saw a 31% decline in profits and a 3.2 percentage point drop in gross margin. This mixed performance signals that while sales are improving, the company's extensive efforts to clear out old inventory through discounting continue to affect overall profitability. CEO Elliott Hill noted positive momentum in wholesale, running, and North America, but acknowledged that other business segments and global regions still face challenges. The article details Nike's ongoing corporate restructuring, including staff reductions and strategic partnerships like the one with Skims, as it strives to boost innovation and reclaim market share.</p>

          <p>Spotify founder Daniel Ek is stepping down as CEO to assume the role of executive chairman, with co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström appointed as co-CEOs, effective January 1. Ek stated this change formalizes how the company has operated since 2023, allowing him to focus on Spotify's "long arc," including global expansion into emerging markets and leveraging new technologies like artificial intelligence. Despite his assurance that the executive chairman role is active, Spotify shares declined over 5% following the announcement. The article notes Ek's two-decade leadership transformed the music business, growing Spotify to over 700 million subscribers.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law, requiring developers of powerful AI models to publish safety and security reports. This legislation focuses on mitigating "catastrophic risks," defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, potentially involving AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. The article explains that the law mandates safety frameworks, critical incident reporting, and whistleblower protections, with penalties up to $1 million per violation. While a single state law may not prevent all disasters, it aims to establish crucial guardrails for rapidly evolving AI technology before widespread harms occur.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal's 2026 rankings have once again named Baruch College (CUNY) as the top best value college in the U.S., marking its third consecutive year in the leading position. The rankings, which assess institutions based on their average net price and the significant value added to graduates' salaries, highlighted Baruch's affordability with an average net price below $3,000 and nearly $50,000 added to graduate earnings. Notably, seven of the top ten institutions in this report are part of the City University of New York network, underscoring a broader trend where American families increasingly prioritize affordability and strong post-graduation outcomes over traditional institutional prestige when selecting colleges.</p>
