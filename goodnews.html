          <p>Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx Corp., has died at the age of 80, leaving behind a legacy of revolutionizing the express delivery industry. Smith founded FedEx in 1973, pioneering a delivery system based on coordinated air cargo flights centered on a main hub, known as the "hub and spokes" system. FedEx became a global transportation and logistics company, averaging 17 million shipments per business day, and played a major role in the shift towards time-sensitive deliveries. Smith, a Marine Corps veteran, attributed his leadership skills and business acumen to his military experience rather than his education at Yale University. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea is set to enter the global competition to develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, according to a senior aerospace executive at Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). KAI's vice-president stated that the technologies showcased at the Paris Air Show, including 4.5-generation fighters and unmanned aerial vehicles, would ultimately contribute to the development of sixth-generation fighters. This move places South Korea alongside other countries, including China and the United States, in the pursuit of advanced aerial warfare capabilities. The company is working on crewed-uncrewed teaming, in which drones operate alongside piloted planes to increase their operational range and serve as a defensive shield. </p>

          <p>Several players and an umpire fell ill during MLB games as a heatwave gripped much of the United States. Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz and Seattle Mariners reliever Trent Thornton experienced heat-related issues, while an umpire had to be treated in the Mariners' dugout. Gametime temperatures were in the low 90s for games in St. Louis and Chicago, with Milwaukee's game in Minnesota played under an excessive heat warning. The Cubs set up cooling and misting stations throughout Wrigley Field to help fans cope with the heat. </p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that most people in Japan are concerned about the potential impact of the war in the Middle East on their daily lives, given the country's reliance on the region for oil. The poll also shows a decline in the public approval rating for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet. Regarding the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's plan to distribute 20,000 yen to ease the impact of inflation, opinions are divided. The survey also gauged voters' views on various societal issues, including married couples keeping different surnames and negotiations with the United States over tariffs. </p>
