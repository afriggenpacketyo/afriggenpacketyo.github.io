          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has postponed the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling delays the termination until a hearing in November, providing temporary relief for individuals, many of whom have resided in the U.S. for over two decades. The judge criticized the administration's rationale, stating the decision appeared preordained rather than based on an objective review of country conditions. The Department of Homeland Security has argued that the conditions that initially justified TPS, such as natural disasters, no longer exist in these countries.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell suggests that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. Researchers analyzed hundreds of genomes from wild and cultivated potatoes to solve the long-standing puzzle of the vegetable's origin. The findings indicate that an ancient tomato provided a key gene for forming tubers, which combined with a gene from a wild, non-tuber-producing potato relative from Chile. This genetic mixing allowed the potato to develop its characteristic starch-rich tubers, demonstrating how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

With only four teams from MLS and four from Liga MX advancing to the quarterfinals, the pressure is on for LAFC to perform. Coach Steve Cherundolo is expected to field his strongest lineup after resting key players in the previous game. Pachuca enters the match with momentum following a win against San Diego, making this a decisive showdown for both clubs in the annual cross-league competition.</p>

Both product and services segments performed well, with the iPhone setting a June quarter sales record and the company's installed base of active devices reaching a new all-time high. Despite the strong financial results, the company offered little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, tempering investor enthusiasm. This leaves Apple as an AI "show me" story in a market that is heavily focused on advancements in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who famously escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, is being created for the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This monument will be the first to honor an individual African American at the state Capitol, a site currently dominated by statues of White men, many with ties to the Confederacy. The bipartisan initiative celebrates Smalls as a Civil War hero and a champion for civil rights. The 12-foot sculpture is intended to commemorate his historic journey from bondage to a pioneering statesman, helping to complete a more inclusive story of the state's history.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and profit, with sales rising 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading as investors were underwhelmed by the modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a mixed forecast for the third quarter. While high-margin businesses like advertising showed strong growth, concerns about AWS's performance compared to rivals and a cautious operating income outlook overshadowed the positive results. The company also signaled a significant increase in capital expenditures, primarily to support demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans for a new $200 million ballroom, a project long desired by President Donald Trump. The construction, which will be situated alongside a modernized East Wing, is set to be funded by private donations from Trump and other anonymous donors, with work scheduled to begin in September. The new venue will have a seating capacity of about 650, eliminating the need for large tents for state dinners and other major events. While the administration frames it as a needed addition, the project is part of a series of renovations that have drawn scrutiny for altering the historic presidential residence.</p>

          <p>In an effort to make its workforce more representative of the country, the UK government will now restrict its main civil service internship scheme to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to harness a broader range of talent and improve government decision-making. Successful interns from the program will be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service. This move is part of a broader government initiative to reform Whitehall and establish more career paths into its senior ranks for people outside of London and privileged backgrounds.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions by acquiring reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call. Unlike other National League contenders who made blockbuster deals, the Dodgers' front office opted to show faith in their current roster rather than pursuing high-priced talent. The team addressed its main needs in the bullpen and outfield without giving up significant prospect capital. Management is betting on the return of injured players and a performance rebound from slumping stars to carry them through the rest of the season and defend their World Series title.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days following a massive outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting one last meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's historic value. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted that the underlying business challenges that prompted the closure, including increased costs and post-pandemic demand issues, remain a concern for the long term.</p>
