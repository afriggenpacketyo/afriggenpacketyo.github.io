          <p>Floods and heavy rains have damaged Indian farmlands, particularly in Punjab, but analysts predict a limited impact on India's overall inflation for fiscal year 2026. This forecast is based on sufficient cereal production and existing stocks, expected to keep food inflation in check. Despite an August inflation rise to 2.1%, experts anticipate that cuts in goods and services tax will help maintain lower price growth. The central bank is expected to ease monetary policy further, spurring domestic growth amid trade challenges with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's Legislature has passed Assembly Bill 268, which seeks to designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would allow public schools and community colleges to close for the observance, and state employees could elect to take the day off. This initiative is seen as a significant recognition of the religious and historical importance of Diwali, particularly for the large South Asian community in California.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, just ahead of a crucial interest rate vote. The court upheld a lower court's ruling that firing Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" removal provisions. Cook's attorneys argued that unproven allegations from before her tenure do not meet this standard, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's independence from political pressure. This decision preserves the board's current composition for the upcoming policy meeting. (not investment advice)</p>
