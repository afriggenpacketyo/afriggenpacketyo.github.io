        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the transformation of the word "pride" from a negative connotation, associated with the deadly sins, to a symbol of empowerment for the LGBTQ+ community. The shift began in the mid-20th century, influenced by the civil rights movement and culminating in the Stonewall Uprising. The word was embraced as a way to counter negative stereotypes and assert self-esteem. Today, "pride" remains a powerful expression of identity and resilience, particularly as the LGBTQ+ community faces ongoing challenges and pushback.</p>
