          <p>Despite a significant 66% drop in its second weekend, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office, earning $40 million. The Marvel film's decline was steeper than that of previous superhero releases, surprising analysts given its positive reviews. The animated sequel "The Bad Guys 2" debuted in second place with $22 million, followed by the comedy "The Naked Gun" with $17 million. Overall, the box office is experiencing a slow start to August, placing pressure on upcoming films to perform strongly to meet summer revenue targets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent comments about accelerating the company's AI roadmap have fueled speculation that Apple may acquire the AI search chatbot company Perplexity. Valued at a reported $18 billion, Perplexity has seen rapid growth with its model that prioritizes real-time, direct answers, aligning with Apple's focus on user experience. An acquisition would provide Apple with an established AI model and a proven freemium subscription business, instantly boosting its position in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape. However, such a large-scale deal would be a departure from Apple's typical strategy of smaller, bolt-on acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Bergen County, New Jersey, caused brief shaking across parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the minor quake occurred Saturday night, startling residents but causing no significant damage or injuries. The event follows a much larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the region in April 2024. While seismic activity is relatively rare on the East Coast, officials and analysts reassured the public that a quake of this small magnitude is not typically destructive and the shaking felt was to be expected.</p>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. This growth is fueled by favorable economics, as solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for solar projects. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is projected to cause a sharp decline in rooftop solar installations. While utility-scale projects continue, the state's momentum depends on overcoming grid constraints and a lack of consistent political support for renewable energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cricket test match between England and India is set for a tense conclusion, with the outcome hanging in the balance. England needs just 35 more runs to secure a historic series victory, while India needs to take four more wickets. The match has been a dramatic seesaw, with heroic centuries from England's Joe Root and Harry Brook turning the tide after the team was in a precarious position. However, a late surge from India's bowlers and the departure of both centurions left the game on a knife-edge before bad weather suspended play, setting up a thrilling finale.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. The fund was established as part of recent legislation that also made significant cuts to Medicaid, raising concerns about the financial viability of rural healthcare providers. Dr. Oz stated the funds are intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the expansion of technology like telehealth. The new law also introduces stricter Medicaid work requirements and eligibility checks, which are projected to reduce coverage for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended a scoring drought to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic baserunning and timely hitting rather than power. After struggling offensively, the team manufactured runs through an aggressive send from the third base coach, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5.2 scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team as it continues to grapple with a slumping lineup and experiments with its batting order.</p>

Resigning from what they once considered dream jobs, they are now engaging in public advocacy, criticizing the dismantling of DOJ norms and running for offices ranging from local city attorney to U.S. Congress.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively high commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on a scheme expected to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, covering agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator has advised consumers to contact their loan providers directly rather than using claims management companies to receive their full compensation. (not investment advice)</p>

After the race, Norris admitted he has been making his races more difficult than necessary and aims to improve in the second half of the season, which promises a tight championship battle between the two McLaren drivers.</p>
