Trump claims the partnership will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Shares of U.S. Steel surged on the news.

          <p>Singer Billy Joel has canceled upcoming concerts due to being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. involves excess cerebrospinal fluid buildup in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is rare but more common with age and is often underdiagnosed. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that bypasses the blocked channel and allows fluid to drain, often combined with physical therapy to improve gait stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge halted the Trump administration's efforts to block international students from attending Harvard University. Harvard sued the administration after its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification was revoked, accusing the administration of retaliation for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights. The lawsuit argued that the action would cause irreparable harm to the university and its international students. The judge issued a temporary restraining order, and a hearing is scheduled for May 29. The Trump administration has been criticized for attacking Harvard and other universities, citing concerns about anti-Semitism and liberal biases.</p>
