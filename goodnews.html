          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado received an 80-game suspension following a positive test for external testosterone under MLB‚Äôs drug-testing program. Alvarado claimed the positive test stemmed from a weight loss drug taken during the offseason, a claim Phillies president Dave Dombrowski seems to believe. The suspension renders Alvarado ineligible for the postseason and will cost him half of his $9 million salary this year. The Phillies will need to find alternative closing options, potentially including Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering, to compensate for Alvarado's absence.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz triumphed over world number one Jannik Sinner in the Italian Open final, ending Sinner's impressive 26-match winning streak with a straight-sets victory. Sinner, returning from a three-month doping ban, aimed to become the first Italian man to win the tournament since 1976, but Alcaraz proved too strong, especially in the second set. After a tight first set decided by a tie-break, Alcaraz dominated the second set, securing the title with a decisive cross-court volley. This victory marks Alcaraz's first Rome title, and he expressed his hope that it would not be his last.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have designated Chris Taylor for assignment, ending his 10-year tenure with the team, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. Taylor, the longest-tenured position player on the roster, was in the final season of a four-year, $60-million contract. His declining production, coupled with the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim, made him expendable, marking the second time in a week that the Dodgers have parted ways with a familiar face.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses how Desi Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, overcame racism and skepticism to become a major force in early television. Arnaz insisted that he play Lucille Ball's husband on TV, challenging the prevailing prejudice against Latinos. He and Ball toured the country to prove their chemistry, and Arnaz's innovation in filming "I Love Lucy" in front of a live audience led to the creation of the rerun and syndication markets. Arnaz's success as an actor and executive rewrote the rules of stardom and demonstrated the importance of diversity in Hollywood.</p>

The author examines how artists and the industry navigate these tensions, particularly in relation to race, authenticity, and the genre's historical association with white identity. The article suggests that the future of country music depends on its ability to embrace diversity and challenge its traditional norms.</p>
