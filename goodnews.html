          <p>Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker renowned for his contributions to both 'Bonnie and Clyde' and 'Kramer vs. Kramer,' has died at the age of 92. Benton's career spanned four decades, during which he received six Oscar nominations and won three times for writing and directing 'Kramer vs. Kramer' and writing 'Places in the Heart.' He was celebrated for his ability to elicit outstanding performances from actors, directing Oscar-winning turns by Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and Sally Field.

          <p>China has successfully completed key technology checks for its experimental Chutian-001 satellite in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), marking progress toward establishing a 300-satellite constellation. The project aims to provide high-resolution remote sensing and communications capabilities. The tests validated core capabilities such as precise satellite control, real-time target detection, and near-Earth environment monitoring. The satellite features a bullet-shaped design to minimize atmospheric drag, a significant challenge for VLEO satellites operating below 300km, and the constellation will be deployed in three phases as part of China's commercial space sector growth.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London, aiming to cut 12,000 roles and close 11 offices in the capital to save ¬£94m annually by 2032. This initiative involves opening new government campuses in Manchester and Aberdeen, creating roles in other towns and cities across the country. The government aims to have 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030. The exact number of relocated civil servants will be determined by a spending review in June, aligning with the Labour government's goal to shrink the civil service.</p>
