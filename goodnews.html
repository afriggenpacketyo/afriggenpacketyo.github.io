          <p>European stock markets advanced on Friday, as investors eagerly awaited a crucial U.S. jobs report anticipated to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The regional Stoxx 600 index saw gains, particularly in mining stocks, buoyed by recent payroll data that increased bets on a September rate cut without sparking fears of a severe economic downturn. Meanwhile, Danish wind farm developer Orsted adjusted its full-year earnings guidance downwards, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds and legal challenges impacting its U.S. projects. This demonstrates a nuanced market environment balancing macroeconomic expectations with specific corporate performance issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, surpassing analyst forecasts, with sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament cited as key drivers. This data, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) after a two-week delay due to data quality concerns, showed a positive month-on-month rise. However, sales over the three months to July were down, and economists caution that the July boosts are unlikely to be sustained. The ONS apologized for past errors and outlined improvement plans, acknowledging the critical role of its statistics in government policy and Bank of England decisions.</p>

This initiative could position OpenAI as a direct competitor to Microsoft's LinkedIn, despite Microsoft being a major investor in the AI startup. The platform intends to assist both large corporations and local businesses in finding AI talent, with a target of certifying 10 million Americans by 2030. These developments unfold amid discussions about AI's impact on the labor market, where roles requiring AI skills are commanding higher salaries.</p>

This investment vehicle allows individuals to raise capital, purchase existing companies, and grow them for profit, offering a lower-risk path to entrepreneurship than starting from scratch. These funds, which generated a 35.1% internal rate of return over 40 years, provide aspiring CEOs with capital, mentorship, and a strategic playbook. The model revitalizes essential "Main Street" businesses while enabling wealth creation in a turbulent economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced an executive order empowering pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines, aiming to ensure easy access for New Yorkers. This move comes as federal regulations create uncertainty, with the FDA approving updated shots only for older and high-risk individuals, and a CDC panel yet to issue recommendations. Governor Hochul emphasized the order as a measure to protect residents from political interference in public health decisions. The action seeks to provide seamless access to preventive care from trusted community providers during a period of regulatory ambiguity.</p>
