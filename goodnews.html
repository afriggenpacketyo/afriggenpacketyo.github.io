          <p>Mike Waltz, former National Security Advisor under President Trump, was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, raising questions about security protocols. The White House defended Waltz's use of the app, stating it was approved for government phones. This incident followed earlier scrutiny when Waltz inadvertently invited a journalist to a Signal chat discussing a U.S. attack in Yemen. Despite the administration's defense, the Pentagon's watchdog criticized the use of Signal for official business, citing breaches of records retention policies. Trump subsequently nominated Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, arguing it violates double jeopardy laws. The defense claims that Mangione is facing concurrent state and federal prosecutions in New York, as well as separate charges in Pennsylvania, infringing on his constitutional rights. They also seek to suppress statements Mangione made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming he was not given Miranda warnings. The attorneys further challenge the terrorism upgrade to the charges, arguing a lack of evidence that Mangione intended to intimidate a civilian population.</p>

          <p>The National Portrait Gallery is launching an immersive exhibition in Salford, combining digital versions of portraits with animation and voiceovers to tell the stories of 19 British icons. The exhibition, titled "Stories Brought to Life," features figures ranging from Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse and aims to engage new audiences outside of London. While the original portraits are free to view in London, this immersive experience charges up to Â£35 for entry, raising questions about accessibility. The article notes that similar immersive experiences have been successful with artists like Van Gogh and Hockney, and a free immersive experience featuring LS Lowry's work is also launching in Salford.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program, the cat was requested from Newquay Zoo and moved to Germany's Black Forest. The lynx will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills. If successful, it will contribute to increasing genetic diversity among lynx populations in central Europe, where they help control deer populations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which will likely increase prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These Chinese giants have relied on the "de minimis" exemption to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. The move aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and protect American businesses. While supporters argue it streamlines customs, critics claim it damages domestic businesses and facilitates smuggling. The UK and EU are also considering similar measures, potentially leading to price increases for consumers globally.</p>

In response to the tariffs, Apple is shifting production of iPhones to India and other products to Vietnam.
