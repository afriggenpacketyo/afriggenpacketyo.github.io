        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UNESCO has expanded its World Heritage List by adding 26 new sites, recognizing their significant cultural or natural value. Among the newly designated locations are King Ludwig II's palaces in Germany, the 17th-century remains of Port Royal in Jamaica, and memorial sites related to the Cambodian genocide. Other notable additions include the biodiverse Bijagós Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau and ancient imperial tombs from the Xixia Dynasty in China. This expansion brings the total number of protected sites to 1,248, with member countries committing to their preservation, sometimes with financial assistance from the international body. The selections were finalized by the World Heritage Committee during a meeting in Paris.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their undisputed heavyweight championship rematch, Oleksandr Usyk engaged in psychological tactics with Daniel Dubois during the official weigh-in. Usyk, weighing in at a career-high 16st 3lb, repeatedly positioned himself in front of Dubois to command the stage, frustrating the British challenger. Dubois, who weighed 17st 6lb, expressed his focus and determination to win by any means necessary. The tense encounter was the final face-off before the two meet at Wembley Stadium, where Usyk aims to repeat his previous stoppage victory and Dubois seeks to become the first undisputed British heavyweight in the four-belt era.</p>

          <h2>Chevron Finalizes $53 Billion Acquisition of Hess Following Legal Victory Over Exxon Mobil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:37:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after an international arbitration panel ruled in its favor against Exxon Mobil. The dispute centered on Exxon's claim to a right of first refusal over Hess's significant stake in the Stabroek Block, a prolific offshore oil development in Guyana. With the legal challenge resolved, Chevron gains a crucial 30% interest in the valuable Guyanese oil reserves, a key strategic goal for the company. While Exxon expressed disagreement with the ruling, it stated it respects the arbitration process and will welcome Chevron to the joint venture, which also includes China's CNOOC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from other major carriers, accounting for over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong brand loyalty, extensive global networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel and international routes. Despite challenges like falling domestic airfares and an air traffic controller shortage, both airlines are leveraging their premium cabins and loyalty programs to maintain profitability. This performance gap highlights a growing divide in the U.S. airline industry, with these two carriers better positioned to weather economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan's July Survey of Consumers indicates that fears of tariff-induced inflation are subsiding, with overall sentiment reaching its highest point since February. The one-year inflation outlook dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year forecast fell to 3.6%. These figures represent the lowest levels since before President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting consumers believe the price pressures will be temporary. Despite the improvement, expectations remain above late-2024 levels, indicating some lingering concern about future price increases. The data is seen as an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve as it monitors inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

Mogollon and three other men, described by DHS as public safety threats, escaped the privately-run ICE facility on June 12 by breaking through a wall. The other three escapees were captured within a week of the incident. Mogollon now faces a federal charge for escaping custody in addition to his prior state-level charges.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their Glastonbury festival performance. The inquiry was launched over on-stage comments related to a band member's upcoming court case on a terror-related charge, which he denies. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. Kneecap condemned the investigation as "political policing intimidation." A separate police inquiry into comments made by the pop-punk duo Bob Vylan during their own Glastonbury set is still ongoing.</p>

This marks a significant moment for the digital currency industry, providing new legal clarity. The signing ceremony occurs as the White House also navigates other issues, including passing a separate bill to cut foreign aid and public broadcasting funds, and addressing pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, now claims that the two young princes allegedly murdered in the Tower of London in the 15th century actually survived. The conventional narrative, popularized by Shakespeare, holds that Richard III had his nephews, Edward V and Richard, killed to secure the throne. Langley's decade-long 'Missing Princes Project' has reportedly uncovered documentary evidence suggesting both boys lived. She argues that the story of their murder was Tudor propaganda and that the burden of proof now lies with those who claim the princes died, challenging a historical mystery that has endured for centuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can be a tool to supplement Social Security income by converting home equity into accessible funds. This financial product allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments as a monthly stream, a lump sum, or a line of credit, helping to cover living expenses or unexpected costs like healthcare. One potential strategy involves using reverse mortgage funds to delay claiming Social Security benefits, which can increase the eventual monthly payments. This approach provides an alternative for managing retirement finances without requiring monthly loan repayments while the owner resides in the home. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in President Trump's new legislative package, titled "no tax on tips," has been enacted, but its application is more complex than the name suggests. The measure provides a tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income, rather than a complete exemption, and it does not affect payroll or state taxes. The tax break, available from 2025 through 2028, phases out for higher earners and requires that tips be properly reported by employers. With the IRS yet to issue specific guidance on which occupations qualify, many of the nation's four million tipped workers face uncertainty about their eligibility for the new deduction.</p>
