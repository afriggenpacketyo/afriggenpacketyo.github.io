        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and prudent policymaking. While it doesn't yet rival the global status of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc, the SGD exhibits defensive characteristics during financial stress. Hurdles to becoming a global safe haven include its relatively small market size and the managed nature of its monetary policy, which limits liquidity. However, experts believe the SGD holds significant potential as a key diversification asset, potentially becoming the "Swiss franc of Asia" over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The northeastern Chinese city of Hegang, facing a shrinking population and economic decline, is investing 1.2 billion yuan in a new airport as part of a strategy to revitalize its economy. Scheduled to open in 2027, Luobei Airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually, aiming to improve connectivity and foster trade, particularly with Russia. This infrastructure project is emblematic of efforts by smaller Chinese cities to seek economic breakthroughs. Experts note that improved air links can be crucial for struggling regions to catch up with more prosperous urban centers.</p>

          <p>Despite years of U.S. sanctions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a formidable leader across China's artificial intelligence landscape, competing in everything from AI chips to industrial applications. The company has developed a full-stack AI portfolio, including its Ascend series of processors and CANN software, which serve as domestic alternatives to Nvidia's products. This strategic pivot, partially fueled by U.S. export controls, has turned Huawei into a national champion, leveraging its vast resources in telecoms, cloud computing, and data centers. The company is now deploying its Pangu AI models in various industries and expanding its ecosystem internationally.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the powerful Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face federal charges of drug and arms trafficking. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison. His gang is linked to a surge in violence that has plagued Ecuador and is also suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition follows a referendum in Ecuador that approved the measure, reflecting President Daniel Noboa's hardline stance against organized crime.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients and small-scale studies report that the drugs help alleviate key PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and hormonal imbalances, often linked to weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, these drugs may address its metabolic roots, though larger clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy. Insurance coverage remains a significant barrier for many patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Japan are moving forward with human clinical trials for a novel drug designed to regrow teeth. The drug functions by inhibiting the USAG-1 protein, which has been shown to suppress tooth development in animal studies with mice and ferrets. Researchers believe the treatment could activate a "third set" of tooth buds that exist in humans but do not normally develop. The initial trial will involve 30 men missing at least one tooth, with plans to expand to children with congenital tooth deficiencies if proven safe, with a target for public availability by 2030.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey continues to stand by her political positions without apology, which have leaned left-of-center over the years. In 2015, she publicly supported Bernie Sanders for president due to his stance against corporate campaign financing. More recently, she revealed that she had promised UFC President Dana White not to speak negatively about Donald Trump, out of respect for their professional relationship and Trump's early support for the UFC. Rousey emphasizes the importance of individual voting rights and encourages people to participate in democracy, regardless of their political affiliation.</p>

          <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, one market analyst argues that the stock market is buoyed by strong underlying factors that can withstand the drama of approaching trade tariff deadlines. The article points to a strong earnings season, massive economic stimulus from the "big beautiful bill," and pro-business tax relief as key drivers of optimism. Additional tailwinds include vast infrastructure needs for data centers and the grid, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a primed IPO market. This analysis suggests these powerful domestic economic forces will likely overshadow negative sentiment from trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>
