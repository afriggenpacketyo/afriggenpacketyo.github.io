          <p>Artificial intelligence infrastructure company CoreWeave has announced its acquisition of data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at around $9 billion. This strategic move is set to bolster CoreWeave's position in the competitive AI sector by integrating critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of data center capacity. The acquisition will eliminate significant future lease obligations for CoreWeave and provide it with greater control over its power and real estate assets. Core Scientific shareholders will receive CoreWeave shares, owning less than 10% of the combined entity after the deal closes in late 2025.</p>

He has officially installed his daughter, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and her husband, Toure Roberts, as the new co-senior pastors of the 30,000-member church. The transition plan has been in development for years and follows a health incident in late 2024 where Jakes suffered a heart attack. He will continue his work as chairman of the T.D.

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Extending Bereavement Leave to Cover Miscarriages Before 24 Weeks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 10:14:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to extend statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, forcing many to use sick leave for what is a period of grief. The proposed change would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the emotional toll of early pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in acknowledging the profound grief associated with miscarriage and ending a long-held societal taboo.</p>

          <p>Alexa Nicholls Costa, a Boston-based nurse practitioner and co-founder of an aesthetic injectables practice, is providing a unique service to women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Drawing from her own stressful experience with IVF, she offers to administer the complex and often daunting daily hormone injections for her clients, free of charge. Many patients find self-injection to be one of the most difficult parts of the fertility process, and Costa's initiative aims to alleviate this burden. She is now collaborating with a fertility clinic to potentially expand this service, making the challenging journey of IVF a little less overwhelming for others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve meeting in July, savers are weighing whether to lock in a certificate of deposit (CD) rate now or wait for potential changes. While a rate cut this month is unlikely, future cuts are anticipated later in the year, which could lead banks to lower their CD yields soon. Experts suggest that savers with adequate liquid emergency funds should consider opening a CD now to secure currently high rates for their specific financial goals. They also recommend strategies like CD laddering, which involves opening multiple CDs with different maturity dates to diversify against future interest rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains how personal data is collected through daily online activities, such as social media use, shopping, and browsing, and then sold by data broker companies. These brokers compile extensive profiles on individuals, which are then purchased by marketers, insurers, and other entities for targeted advertising, risk assessment, and sometimes malicious purposes like identity theft. To regain control, individuals can review privacy settings on apps, use privacy-focused tools like different browsers or extensions, and be cautious about sharing information.

          <p>According to communication experts, an effective apology from a leader requires taking full responsibility, demonstrating genuine empathy, and presenting a clear plan for rectification. The timing of an apology is critical; waiting too long can suggest a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Leaders should avoid sounding scripted or emotionless and instead show vulnerability to build trust. The analysis comes in the context of public apologies from corporate CEOs, highlighting that a sincere, human approach is more impactful than a polished but impersonal brand statement.</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to attract elite Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Kathryn Bigelow, even though it largely forgoes wide theatrical releases for its films. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to its massive global subscriber base of over 300 million. It has also become a sanctuary for auteur-driven projects with large budgets or risky genres that traditional studios might pass on. By prioritizing its streaming audience and saving millions on theatrical marketing, Netflix has built a successful model that challenges conventional Hollywood distribution strategies.</p>
