          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the first African woman chosen to curate the Venice Biennale, has died at the age of 57 in Switzerland, just before she was scheduled to announce the theme of the event. Kouoh was known for her work as the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, where she championed artists of color from Africa and beyond, staging several acclaimed shows that gained international recognition. Colleagues remember her as a mentor, a visionary, and a champion of underrepresented voices in the art world, emphasizing her unique ability to connect with artists and create exhibitions with ethical grounding. Her death leaves a significant void in the contemporary art community, as she was highly anticipated to bring a fresh perspective to the Venice Biennale.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful. She emphasizes that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. Ross points out that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems, a holdover from the past, and encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections. She suggests that mothers should cut themselves some slack and recognize that being good enough is already a success.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership believed Han had a better chance of winning the elections, but PPP members voted against the motion to switch candidates. This decision follows a period of turmoil within the PPP since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol.
