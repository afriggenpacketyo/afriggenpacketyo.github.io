          <p>This article explores how Colin Jost, co-host of Saturday Night Live's "Weekend Update," has embraced being the show's "default punch line." Initially criticized as a bland and privileged figure, Jost has found success by acknowledging and leaning into the public's disdain. The article highlights his interactions with cast members like Sarah Sherman, who often uses her appearances to mock and challenge Jost's perceived outdated views. By willingly serving as a target for jokes, Jost has become a pressure-release valve for cultural anxieties and a more sympathetic figure on the show.</p>
