          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering nuclear power as a means to achieve greater energy independence, driven partly by the costs associated with renewable energy sources. Denmark plans to analyze the potential of new nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, while Spain may review the shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany has softened its opposition to atomic power. This renewed interest in nuclear energy reflects a hedging strategy to complement renewables like solar and wind, ensuring a more stable and diverse energy supply for the future. Denmark, however, clarified it does not plan to return to traditional nuclear power plants.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain due to pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens and prevents it from fully opening. After contracting COVID-19 and experiencing a series of unexplained symptoms, doctors at NYU Langone eventually diagnosed Mauceri's condition through open-heart surgery. The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, involved removing the thickened pericardium, allowing Mauceri's heart to function normally again. Following the surgery and subsequent treatment for a small intestine blockage, Mauceri has returned to conducting and feels healthier than he has in years.</p>

          <p>As former Governor Andrew Cuomo leads in the New York City mayoral race, his rivals are increasingly comparing him to the current mayor, Eric Adams, suggesting that electing Cuomo would be akin to a second term for Adams. Both are moderate Democrats who often criticize the left wing of their party and share similar policy positions on mental health, rent control, and charter schools. The Justice Department is investigating Cuomo over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation mirroring Adams's own federal investigation. Despite these similarities, Cuomo's campaign emphasizes his superior management skills compared to Adams's scandal-ridden tenure.</p>

Rancher and former state lawmaker John Davis, a staunch Trump supporter, has allowed wind turbines on his property, providing significant financial opportunities for his family and local community. However, a series of bills in the Texas legislature threaten to curtail the state's renewable energy sector, prompting bewilderment among conservatives who recognize the economic benefits of clean energy. These bills could reverse Texas's position as a clean energy leader and limit landowners' ability to host wind and solar farms.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025 to 1.2%, rising to 1.4% in 2026, citing an ongoing economic recovery. However, the IMF warns that the Chancellor must adhere to fiscal rules regarding tax and spending to maintain stability. The report points to global trade tensions and uncertainty as factors that could weigh down growth, while praising the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans. The IMF suggests some changes to the government's self-imposed fiscal rules, including cutting the number of times the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) produces an assessment of the UK's finances to once a year, rather than twice.

The proposal aims to avoid the anticlimactic outcome of a drawn series, as seen in 2017 against New Zealand, and enhance fan engagement. Super Rugby Pacific has already introduced golden point for regular season games, but knockout games use two 10-minute periods of standard extra time before resorting to golden point.</p>

          <p>Matti Schmid's success on the greens has reignited the debate over broom-handle golf putters, which were effectively banned in 2016 due to concerns about anchoring. While anchoring the putter against the body is prohibited, clamping an extended shaft against a forearm is permitted, though some believe this technique makes putting too easy. The difficulty in enforcing the rule consistently has led to calls for a simpler solution, such as limiting the maximum length of putters. The issue highlights the ongoing tension between tradition and innovation in golf equipment and technique.</p>

          <p>Leaders from China, Southeast Asia, and six Arab nations convened their first summit in Malaysia to bolster economic cooperation amid global trade tensions with the U.S. Chinese Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of opening up across regions, referring to the China-ASEAN free trade agreement and the China-GCC free trade pact. The combined GDP of these regions totals $24.87 trillion, representing a population of approximately 2.15 billion.

          <p>Billie Eilish dominated the American Music Awards, winning seven prizes including artist and album of the year, though she was absent due to touring. Jennifer Lopez hosted and performed, attracting attention for kissing dancers of both genders, which drew mixed reactions. Sir Rod Stewart received the lifetime achievement award presented by his children, and Janet Jackson was honored with the Icon Award, performing on TV for the first time in seven years. Another highlight on the night for many on social media it seems was Shaboozey's reaction to Megan Moroney declaring that the Carter Family "basically invented country music".</p>
