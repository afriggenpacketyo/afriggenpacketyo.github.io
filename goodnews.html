          <p>Iraq's Oil Ministry announced the resumption of crude oil exports to Turkey from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, ending a two-and-a-half-year deadlock. The pipeline, which had been frozen since March 2023 after independent Kurdish sales were deemed illegal, is now fully operational following an agreement between the federal government, the Kurdistan regional government, and foreign oil producers. This development signifies a significant step towards resolving long-standing disputes over oil revenue sharing and regional autonomy.</p>

The meeting will include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. This comes after Trump previously canceled a meeting, criticizing Democratic demands as "unserious and ridiculous." Lawmakers are under pressure to pass a full-year spending bill or a temporary continuing resolution to prevent a halt in non-essential government services.</p>

          <p>The UK has successfully grown and is preparing to harvest its first rice crop as part of an ambitious trial addressing future food security and climate change. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's sole rice-grower, cultivated nine varieties on a Cambridgeshire farm, benefiting from the hottest summer on record. This experiment, led by UKCEH, explores how new crops could protect farmer livelihoods and combat climate change by re-wetting peat soils to lock in greenhouse gases. Initial results suggest the rice crop does not increase emissions.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David are rapidly establishing a new media dynasty, pursuing deals that could give them control over major companies like TikTok and CNN. Larry Ellison's close relationship with President Trump, who has endorsed their ventures, is facilitating their ascent. David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining oversight of CBS, and the family is reportedly eyeing Warner Brothers Discovery. These moves, while raising concerns about media concentration and political influence, signal a significant shift in the US media landscape.</p>

          <h2>Indian Researchers Win Ig Nobel Prize for Study on Smelly Shoes and Shoe Rack Design</h2>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, initially aimed at designing better student shoe racks, discovered that odor, caused by the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, was the primary issue. They developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear, finding that 2-3 minutes of UVC treatment effectively eliminated the smell. This inventive, quirky scientific endeavor offers a practical solution to a common household problem.</p>

          <p>Europe holds a commanding 11½-4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, needing only three more points to secure victory. Captain Luke Donald is on the verge of becoming the second European captain to win both home and away matches. No team has ever overcome such a deficit, with Europe's current lead being the largest they've held at this stage. Despite US captain Keegan Bradley's calls for a "sporting miracle," statistics strongly favor Europe, making a historic comeback highly improbable.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, who spread baseless claims of 2020 election rigging. Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to President Trump, had falsely alleged that Dominion's machines were manipulated to flip votes. This settlement follows similar agreements with Fox News and Newsmax, marking another legal and financial setback for Giuliani. The lawsuit aimed to counter conspiracy theories that undermined public confidence in US elections and led to threats against election officials.</p>

          <p>The article explores the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, noting that while popular, dermatologists remain skeptical. Collagen, vital for skin and joint health, naturally declines with age. While some users report benefits, experts like Dr. Emma Wedgeworth question if orally ingested collagen peptides effectively reach the skin. Studies show conflicting results, with industry-funded research suggesting improvements, while independent studies find no significant effect. Experts emphasize that sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking are more impactful for skin health.</p>
