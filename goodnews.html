          <p>Michelle Renee, a California mother and bank manager, recounts her harrowing experience of being kidnapped with her daughter and forced to rob her own bank. The kidnappers strapped fake dynamite to Michelle and her daughter, Breea, and threatened to detonate it if Michelle didn't comply with their demands. During the trial of the kidnappers, Michelle was treated as a criminal and attacked for her past as a stripper and financial difficulties. Despite the trauma, Michelle and Breea survived, and Michelle has since become an advocate for trauma survivors, even after Breea was diagnosed with a rare form of multiple sclerosis. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports suggests that dog owners who dwell on work-related stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners with high job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and restlessness. The connection was primarily driven by rumination, where owners mentally took work home with them. The study highlights the idea of "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to others in a household, including pets, and suggests that avoiding work-related ruminations at home could benefit both owners and their dogs.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin struggled with command, issuing key walks that led to Soto's opportunity. Mets starter David Peterson delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ‚Öî innings and limiting the Dodgers to two runs. The Dodgers' overworked bullpen was a factor, limiting manager Dave Roberts' options and contributing to the team's reliance on the starting pitcher's performance.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions, increasing their annual salaries to over 6 million yen due to growing competition for talent as Japanese cuisine gains global popularity. Chefs will also be allowed to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of serving as live-in staff at diplomatic establishments. The initiative aims to recruit and retain skilled chefs who play significant roles in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food abroad. The changes include offering funds to help chefs bring their spouses to their work locations. </p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The government has hailed the move as a "new dawn for rail" but stopped short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure. Unions have voiced concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are calling for Labour to deliver on their promises. SWR trains will now be managed by DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR). </p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if they come into power, increasing pressure on the Labour party. The move is intended to highlight divisions within Labour, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces pressure from his own MPs to change his approach to both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on winter fuel payments when the pension top-up was restricted last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and sexual assault" helped define the modern view of sexual assault, has died at the age of 90. Her book argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence, not passion, and it led to laws that made it easier to prosecute those who perpetrate sexual assault. The book faced criticism for its feminist dogma and assertions about the role of men, but it also sparked significant changes in society's attitude toward sexual violence, including the opening of rape-crisis centers and the rewriting of laws. She also fought against the multi-billion-dollar pornography industry. </p>
