        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm made a deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The departures follow an executive order from Trump that criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who investigated Trump, and for taking on a pro bono case related to the January 6 Capitol riot. The order was later rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, including auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on mutually agreed causes. The deal and subsequent departures have sparked controversy in the legal community.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting the resource-rich Jiangxi province to the wealthy coastal Zhejiang province. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, part of a larger project to connect Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water, is expected to cost $44.4 billion, making it the most expensive artificial canal in China. The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. Planned as a Class III waterway, it will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to make it available at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms. This initiative aims to curb rising rice prices that have hurt households amidst inflation. The government plans to release 300,000 tons initially and may provide additional supplies if necessary. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, doubling last year's level due to a poor harvest and increased demand.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), with some staff being reassigned within the administration. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, Andy Baker, and White House deputy chief of staff, Robert Gabriel, are taking top roles in the restructured NSC. About 20 people have been informed they are on administrative leave as part of the changes. The restructuring comes weeks after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser, driven by concerns about staff vetting and involvement in a Signal group chat.</p>

The condition is relatively uncommon and more likely to occur in older people, but is usually treatable with a surgical procedure to drain the fluid.</p>

          <p>A French court has found eight people guilty in connection with the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian, where jewelry worth $10 million was stolen. The robbers, disguised as police, tied up Kardashian in her Paris hotel room during the heist. The convicted individuals received prison sentences ranging from three to eight years, while two other defendants were acquitted. Kardashian testified earlier this month, stating that she feared for her life during the ordeal.</p>

          <p>King Charles is preparing for a historic visit to Canada, marking the first time a monarch will open Canada's Parliament in almost 70 years, amid tensions with President Trump. The visit is seen as a show of support for Canadian sovereignty following Trump's remarks about Canada potentially becoming part of the US. The King's speech, written on the advice of Canada's government, is expected to emphasize Canada's independence. The visit balances solidarity with Canada without jeopardizing the UK's relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp expressed his disappointment and switched off the television after hearing supporters boo Trent Alexander-Arnold. After announcing his decision to not sign a new contract, some fans turned against the player and some booed him when he came off the substitutes bench against Arsenal earlier this month. Klopp defended the Liverpool-born player's commitment to the club during his managerial tenure. He said supporters were "wrong" to boo and launched a passionate defence of the England full-back.</p>

          <h2>Government Postpones Publication of Child Poverty Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 19:09:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, until at least the autumn. The government states it is "determined to bring down child poverty" and will publish an ambitious strategy later this year. The Child Poverty Taskforce is still working on the strategy, considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The delay has been criticized by the SNP and Save the Children UK, while the Trussell Trust charity suggested it may be beneficial if it leads to more substantial measures.</p>
