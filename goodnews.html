          <p>Home Depot is set to release its quarterly earnings, with analysts watching how the retailer is navigating a challenging economic environment. The company has increasingly relied on sales to professional contractors like roofers and landscapers to offset a slowdown in large-scale homeowner projects, which have been dampened by higher interest rates. This report will also provide insight into Home Depot's strategy for managing tariff-related costs, as it has previously aimed to avoid price hikes by diversifying its supply chain away from China. The company's performance is seen as a key indicator of consumer health and the housing market's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some animal species, like the South American cane toad, produce cardiotonic steroids, a potent toxin that can induce a fatal heart attack in predators. However, evolutionary biologist Shabnam Mohammadi explains that this same class of chemical compounds has been harnessed for medicinal purposes since ancient Egypt. Modern medicine continues this practice, with certain versions of these steroids being prescribed to treat patients suffering from congestive heart failure. The article explores this paradox, detailing how some predators have evolved resistance to the toxin while humans have adapted it for therapeutic use.</p>

          <p>A free summer camp at Princeton University, called AI4All, is working to address the emerging "AI divide" in education by teaching high schoolers from low-income backgrounds about artificial intelligence. Research indicates that affluent, suburban school districts are far more likely to offer AI training and resources than their urban, rural, or high-poverty counterparts. The program aims to democratize AI education, empowering a more diverse group of young people to shape the future of the technology. Students attending the camp expressed a newfound appreciation for AI's potential to solve major problems and the importance of including underrepresented voices in its development.</p>

          <p>Morecambe FC has named 30-year-old Ashvir Singh Johal as its new manager, making him the youngest boss in the top five tiers of English football and the first Sikh to manage a professional British club. The appointment follows the National League club's recent takeover by the Panjab Warriors consortium, which ended a period of severe financial instability. Johal, who recently earned his Uefa Pro Licence, has previous coaching experience at Leicester City's academy and has worked with notable figures like Kolo Toure and Cesc Fabregas.

          <p>According to the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, the United Kingdom has rescinded a controversial notice that would have required Apple to create a "back door" to access encrypted user data worldwide. The demand, issued under the Investigatory Powers Act, had prompted Apple to disable its Advanced Data Protection feature in the UK and initiate a legal challenge. Privacy advocates have cautiously welcomed the news, viewing the government's original demand as a significant threat to personal and national security. While the UK government has not officially confirmed the withdrawal, the development marks a potential de-escalation in the conflict between tech companies and governments over encryption.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to win a by-election in the Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, ensuring his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre lost his long-held Ottawa-area seat in the general election four months prior, making this victory crucial for his leadership. The special election was called after the sitting Conservative MP stepped down to create an opening for him in the party's stronghold. Despite facing a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group, Poilievre secured a commanding lead, allowing him to resume his role in Parliament for the autumn session.</p>

          <p>China's National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) has launched a new initiative to improve the quality of its television programming, with a particular focus on documentaries, animations, and mini-dramas. This effort is part of a broader strategy to expand the country's soft power and cultural influence on the international stage. The plan includes providing more support for the production of high-quality content and strengthening the legal framework for copyright protection. According to the NRTA, short-form micro-dramas have already become a significant growth area for China's online video industry, with their overseas influence rapidly increasing.</p>

          <p>The US Open has reimagined its mixed doubles event, attracting top singles players like Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek with large cash prizes and a shorter format. The move is intended to generate more fan interest and elevate the sport's profile, with some hailing it as a fantastic new initiative. However, the changes have drawn criticism from many doubles specialists, such as Jamie Murray, who argue it devalues a Grand Slam title and transforms the competition into a "glorified exhibition." The lucrative prize money and appearance fees for singles stars have been particularly contentious, as traditional doubles players are largely excluded from the new format.</p>

This success is attributed to a multi-faceted strategy focused on improving road safety as part of the EU's "Vision Zero" initiative. Key measures include lowering speed limits to 30 kilometers per hour (18.6 mph) on most city streets, redesigning infrastructure to protect pedestrians and cyclists, and using data to identify and fix dangerous intersections. Enhanced speed enforcement through a network of 60 fixed cameras has also been crucial in changing driver behavior and making the city safer.</p>

The article also explains that a car's performance differs between qualifying and a race because peak tire grip in a single lap can mask underlying balance issues that cause faster tire degradation over a long stint.

          <p>Sweden has commenced the extraordinary two-day process of moving the historic Kiruna Church to a new location 5 kilometers away. The 113-year-old wooden structure, weighing 672 tons, is being relocated because the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine threatens to destabilize the ground beneath the town. The church was lifted onto a convoy of remote-controlled trailers for its slow journey, an event financed by the state-owned mining company LKAB.
