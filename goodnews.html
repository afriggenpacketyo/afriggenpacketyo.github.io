          <p>Svetlana Dali was found guilty on a federal stowaway charge after sneaking onto a Delta flight from New York City to Paris. Dali's sentencing guidelines call for up to six months in prison, and she has already been held without bail for five months. She was taken into custody by French authorities upon landing in Paris and subsequently returned to New York after an initial disturbance on her return flight. Dali was then re-arrested in Buffalo after allegedly removing her GPS monitor and attempting to cross the border into Canada.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that President Trump's claims of genocide against white farmers in South Africa have been met with anger, disbelief, and humor by Black South Africans. Many feel that after living through decades of apartheid, it is infuriating to see Afrikaners, the white descendants of colonizers, portrayed as victims. The article highlights how Black South Africans are using humor to cope with the grinding poverty and violent crime that many still endure. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to address his country's economic issues, Trump continued to make false claims, undermining the seriousness of their meeting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA has successfully revived a set of roll thrusters on Voyager 1 that had been inactive for two decades. This reactivation is crucial because the spacecraft's primary thrusters are showing signs of clogging, potentially failing as early as Fall 2025. These smaller thrusters ensure Voyager's antenna remains aligned with Earth, maintaining communication. While Deep Space Station 43, the antenna used to communicate with Voyager, is undergoing upgrades, the team will be unable to communicate with the probes until February 2026, highlighting the importance of these upgrades for future Moon missions.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, a local organization for underprivileged youth. The city initially sued Smollett for reimbursement of the $130,000 cost of investigating his claims of a racist and homophobic hate crime, which police determined to be a hoax. Smollett's conviction was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on double jeopardy grounds, and he maintained the attack was real in a countersuit against the city. The settlement allows all parties to move forward from the six-year-old case.</p>

          <p>Frank Bisignano, the newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration, told agency staff that he had to Google the job when first offered the position by the Trump administration. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, said he wasn't seeking a government role and was unfamiliar with the commissioner's responsibilities. Despite his lack of prior government experience, Bisignano aims to modernize the agency, improve customer service, and address concerns about the future of Social Security amid leadership turnover and scrutiny from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The meeting occurred amid upheaval at the federal health department, with Trump administration officials announcing a less aggressive approach to booster shots and new trial requirements. Access to Covid-19 vaccines will be limited to people 65 and older and others considered high-risk, and manufacturers must conduct clinical trials to show whether the vaccines benefit healthy younger adults and children. The committee recommended targeting strains of the JN.1 variant for the 2025-2026 period.</p>

The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the islands, with international courts siding with Mauritius.
