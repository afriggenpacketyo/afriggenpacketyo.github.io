          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 17:55:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chicago Bears achieved a record $8.9 billion valuation after a 2.35% minority stake was sold to existing owners, a deal approved by the NFL finance committee. This valuation marks a substantial increase from $6.4 billion just a year ago, positioning the team as number seven among NFL teams. The sale involved the estate of Andrew McKenna, with the McCaskey and Ryan families consolidating their ownership. This transaction highlights the escalating financial worth of NFL franchises, with even small limited partner stakes commanding significant premiums due to limited ownership opportunities and overall league growth. The team is also exploring building a new domed stadium in Arlington Heights to host year-round events, potentially boosting non-NFL revenue and further increasing its value.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug primarily used to ease chemotherapy side effects, is demonstrating promising results in improving speech for some children with autism. Parents of Mason Connor, diagnosed with autism, reported their son became verbal just days after beginning the off-label treatment. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, leads research suggesting leucovorin bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, which may contribute to neurological problems associated with autism spectrum disorder. The FDA has initiated the approval process for leucovorin as an autism treatment, despite the absence of large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials, underscoring the potential impact of this repurposed medication.</p>

          <p>The UK government is actively considering various financial support measures for companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, which are facing severe disruption due to a recent cyberattack. JLR halted car production in late August, and its factories are expected to remain suspended until at least next month, creating significant economic strain. There are growing fears that smaller suppliers, many of whom rely solely on JLR's business, could face bankruptcy without intervention. Proposed solutions include the government purchasing and stockpiling component parts to keep businesses afloat or providing government-backed loans, while a more extensive Covid-style furlough scheme has been deemed too costly and ruled out.</p>

          <p>China's Global Governance Initiative aims to rectify three significant deficits within the existing international governance frameworks. Firstly, it addresses the serious underrepresentation of the Global South, advocating for enhanced participation and influence from emerging markets and developing countries to correct historical imbalances. Secondly, the initiative highlights the erosion of authoritativeness, pointing to instances where the UN Charter is not effectively observed and unilateral sanctions violate international law. Thirdly, it underscores the urgent need for greater effectiveness in addressing global challenges, noting the lagging implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda and the growing salience of issues like climate change, the digital divide, and the need for governance in new frontiers such as artificial intelligence and outer space.</p>

          <p>An experimental gene therapy, AMT-130, has demonstrated remarkable preliminary success in significantly slowing the progression of Huntington's disease. In a three-year trial, patients receiving a high dose experienced a 75% reduction in disease progression compared to standard care. This one-time treatment works by delivering genetic instructions via a harmless virus to the brain, effectively turning off the faulty protein responsible for damaging brain cells. While these early results are highly promising and could allow patients to maintain daily function longer, the therapy requires complex brain surgery and is still years away from potential FDA approval, pending larger studies to confirm its safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Medical professionals and public health officials are strongly reaffirming the safety and recommendation of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pregnant women to manage fevers and pain, directly countering recent comments from Donald Trump. Trump had suggested expecting mothers should "tough it out" and linked Tylenol use to autism without new evidence. Doctors warn that untreated fevers during pregnancy can pose significant risks to both mother and baby, potentially leading to serious developmental issues. Major medical bodies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Tylenol's manufacturer, emphasize that overwhelming scientific evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, urging women to consult their doctors.</p>

          <p>President Trump is anticipated to finalize a deal orchestrated by his administration, allowing TikTok to continue its operations within the U.S. by declaring it a "qualified divestiture." This agreement, prompted by a congressional law requiring ByteDance to divest or face a ban, entails copying and retraining TikTok's content recommendation algorithm to function exclusively on U.S. user data. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will assume responsibility for "top to bottom security," hosting American user data and auditing the app's code for appropriate behavior and security. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will acquire a stake in TikTok, though some lawmakers remain concerned about potential lingering influence from ByteDance regarding the algorithm.</p>

Wagner reportedly attempted to enter her Los Angeles home on three occasions in July 2024, and made "untrue" statements claiming to live on her property and be in a relationship with her. Furthermore, he allegedly changed his driver's license address to hers with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The court order now prohibits Wagner from contacting Swift, approaching any of her homes or workplaces, and owning firearms. This incident underscores the persistent security challenges faced by public figures, as Swift has previously sought similar legal protections against other individuals exhibiting obsessive behavior.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt to the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms in British Columbia. The cull was ordered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) following an avian flu outbreak on the farm. Owners Katie Pastiney and Karen Espersen have fiercely resisted the order, engaging in a months-long legal battle and even facing brief arrest for obstruction. The controversial case has attracted international attention, including appeals from figures like U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to study the birds instead of culling them. The Supreme Court's intervention provides a reprieve while it determines whether to hear the owners' appeal against the cull order.</p>

The White House aims for a small equity stake to establish a cash buffer and mitigate taxpayer risk, particularly as parts of the loan repayment are deferred to later years.

          <p>Effectively managing multiple debts is crucial in today's challenging economic environment, marked by elevated interest rates and inflation. This article outlines several structured strategies to help borrowers efficiently pay off various obligations. The "debt snowball" method prioritizes paying the smallest balance first to build psychological momentum, while the "debt avalanche" method targets debts with the highest interest rates to maximize interest savings. Additional approaches include utilizing balance transfer credit cards with 0% introductory APRs to temporarily halt interest accumulation, consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, or engaging with credit counseling agencies to develop a debt management plan. For those facing genuine financial hardship, debt settlement is presented as a last-resort option.</p>
