          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third quarter, with net income surging by 39.1% year-over-year to NT$452.3 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. The impressive performance was driven by sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. High-performance computing, which includes AI applications, accounted for 57% of total revenue. In response to this continued growth, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling strong confidence in the booming AI market.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's Senate has passed a "Dignified Death" bill, making it the first country in Latin America to formally legalize euthanasia for terminally ill patients. The law permits an adult citizen who is mentally competent and suffering from an irreversible, terminal disease to choose a medically assisted death administered by a healthcare professional. The legislation, which previously passed the lower house with a large majority, reflects strong public support, with over 60% of Uruguayans in favor. This move continues Uruguay's history of progressive social policies in a predominantly Catholic region, following earlier legalizations of cannabis, same-sex marriage, and abortion.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim faces a pivotal series of four matches that could define the team's season, starting with a difficult away game against Liverpool. A recent 2-0 victory over Sunderland eased some pressure on Amorim, and he has received public backing from minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. However, the team's performance has been inconsistent, with only 10 wins in 34 league games under his leadership and a failure to secure consecutive victories. The upcoming fixtures against Brighton, Nottingham Forest, and Tottenham—teams United has struggled against recently—will be a crucial test of whether the club is making meaningful progress.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a decisive 13-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series, narrowing their series deficit to 2-1. Toronto's offense dominated, amassing 18 hits, including five home runs, against Seattle's pitching. Mariners' starter George Kirby struggled, giving up eight hits as the Blue Jays' batters aggressively attacked his pitches early in the count. Home runs from Andrés Giménez, George Springer, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Alejandro Kirk, and Addison Barger powered the rout, marking a significant offensive turnaround after scoring only four runs in the first two games of the series.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open lower on Thursday, continuing a week of volatile trading as investors navigate economic uncertainty. Major indices including the UK's FTSE, Germany's DAX, and France's CAC 40 are all projected to start the day in negative territory. This follows a mixed session on Wednesday where markets rebounded, driven by gains in luxury brands and positive sentiment in France after the new prime minister pledged to suspend a controversial pension reform. Investors are now awaiting the latest UK GDP data and corporate earnings reports from major firms including Nordea Bank and ABB for further market direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former England and Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has clarified that his move to the United Arab Emirates to play for Arabian Falcons was not financially motivated. The 33-year-old is playing in the UAE's third-tier league, where he says the standard wage is significantly lower than what his brother earns working in a London hotel. After an unsuccessful trial at Hull City and a hamstring injury, Shelvey accepted the offer from a childhood friend to help grow the Dubai-based club. He also cited a desire for a "fresh start" for his family, expressing concerns about safety and the social climate in the UK.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, despite the team's 121-94 loss. Vincent started the game on fire, hitting his first five three-point attempts and scoring 18 points in the first quarter alone. He finished with 22 points, shooting six for eleven from beyond the arc, providing a bright spot for a Lakers squad resting many of its key starters. Teammate Jarred Vanderbilt also played well before leaving the game with a left quad contusion, an injury that will be monitored as the team prepares for the regular season opener.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old hillwalker, Ian Currie, has been rescued after surviving for eight days alone in the remote and rugged terrain of the Scottish Highlands. Currie became lost during what was meant to be a three-day trek from Glenfinnan to Knoydart after severe weather caused a river to swell, making his path impassable. He endured exhaustion, exposure, and a soaked tent and phone, surviving what he described as a "long black nightmare." He was eventually found by a local estate owner and deer stalkers after a search was initiated by mountain rescue teams, who praised his incredible resilience in the harsh conditions.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest point in a year. This move comes amid growing market expectations that the US Federal Reserve may implement further interest rate cuts, which would weaken the dollar. A Fed governor recently highlighted that ongoing US-China trade tensions have increased risks to the US economy, strengthening the case for rate reductions. The stronger fixing by the PBOC is seen as a signal of its intent to manage the currency's value in a shifting global economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Investor sentiment was further boosted by comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary indicating that a trade deal between Washington and Seoul was nearing completion. Shares of major export-oriented companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor led the gains, reflecting confidence in the resilience of the South Korean economy amid global trade tensions.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice as he works to break out of a significant postseason slump. Through the playoffs, Ohtani has struggled at the plate, batting just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts, prompting his manager to state the team cannot win a World Series with that level of performance. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his dual role as a pitcher is contributing to his hitting difficulties, stating he does not feel a direct physical connection between the two. His visible effort to recalibrate his swing signals an urgency to return to form for the remainder of the NLCS.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent layoff notices to over 4,000 workers, with plans to cut thousands more. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own statements indicating the cuts were intended to punish political opponents by targeting "Democrat Agencies." The order applies to members of two federal unions that filed the lawsuit, arguing the actions were illegal, arbitrary, and capricious, with a further hearing scheduled for October 28.</p>

The ceremony, which is being held in Newcastle for the first time, also features nominees like Fontaines DC, PinkPantheress, and 84-year-old folk legend Martin Carthy.

          <p>President Donald Trump is advancing plans to construct a large triumphal arch in Washington D.C., situated across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial. The monument, dubbed the "Arc de Trump," is intended to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026 and would be privately funded by his supporters. The proposal is the latest in a series of aesthetic changes Trump has initiated in the capital, which include a gilded Oval Office makeover and a new $250 million White House ballroom. Trump has reviewed renderings of the arch, which he envisions as a new gateway to the city from Arlington, Virginia.</p>
