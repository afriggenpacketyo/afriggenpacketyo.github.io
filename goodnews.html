The lawsuit seeks to ensure deaf and hard of hearing individuals have equal access to White House information.

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, offers borrowers a potential pathway to reduce their outstanding balances, often by 30% to 50%. This option typically requires a debt settlement agreement, which can be reached through various avenues, including debt management programs or bankruptcy. To qualify, borrowers generally need a minimum debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship.
