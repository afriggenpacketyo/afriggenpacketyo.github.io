          <p>Decades after leaving high school to serve in the Vietnam War, Dennis Snyder and Richard Hill received their diplomas alongside the Muscatine High class of 2025. Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy before his junior year, always regretted missing his high school graduation. Both veterans participated in Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program that honors veterans with the opportunity to graduate. Snyder shared the honor with friends who did not return from the war, emphasizing the importance of recognizing veterans' service. The program provides a meaningful way for veterans to close a chapter and receive the recognition they deserve.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer using a non-invasive method. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine samples. A survey using the test kits detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman in her 60s, leading to successful surgery, as well as precancerous cells in other participants. The company hopes this technology will improve early cancer detection, especially in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The researchers' model aligns with the "four symbols" theory, emphasizing the balance between passive and active forces. This study redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in a single-celled eukaryote, which is one of the smallest model organisms used in the study of molecular life mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The White House published photos on its X account showing President Trump and his senior team in the Situation Room during the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The images offer a rare glimpse inside the highly secret complex, depicting Trump with officials including Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Rubio, and Defense Secretary Hegseth. The photos show Trump monitoring the mission and consulting with his team, with the officials gathered around a large wooden table in the main conference room. The Situation Room underwent a $50 million renovation in 2023, making this a vastly different setting from Trump's previous term.</p>

In Borrego Park, where Blaze died, hundreds of hand-painted stones left by strangers serve as a memorial. The stones symbolize tolerance and inspire the LGBTQ+ community.

These platforms, both online and offline, allow consumers to view homes more transparently and efficiently. Chengdu recently launched a homebuying platform in partnership with state-owned and private developers, featuring over 50 projects on a mobile app. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, with some including second-hand listings and physical storefronts. The platforms aim to improve transaction efficiency and minimize false promotions, though access may be limited to residents with housing vouchers.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rebuke of his own intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, calling it "shocking" and suggesting Trump is disavowing his intelligence community for political reasons. Reed believes Trump's actions are related to his consideration of an attack against Iran, as he needs to establish that Iran has the capacity and intent to develop a nuclear weapon. Weeks ago, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified that the intelligence community continues to assess "Iran is not building a nuclear weapon." Reed added that if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, "there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately."</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband Bob was overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and cast doubt on the original verdict. The Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover that some blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. While Dorotik was released, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again if new evidence surfaces. Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women.</p>
