          <p>Chinese investments in Europe experienced a 47% surge in 2024, marking the first increase in nine years, with Hungary solidifying its position as a leading hub for Chinese capital. This rise comes after a period of decline following increased scrutiny from European governments over Chinese acquisitions of critical technology firms. Greenfield investments, where Chinese companies launch new ventures by constructing facilities, rose by 21%, while mergers and acquisitions jumped by 114%. The report highlights that over half of China's investments in high-income economies were directed towards Europe, signaling a shift amid challenges in other markets like the US.</p>

          <p>A representative for former President Joe Biden clarified that he last underwent a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test in 2014, which is consistent with medical recommendations for men over 70. Current guidelines suggest that men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of PSA testing with their doctor, while those 70 and older should not receive routine PSA-based screening due to the risk of false positives. The statement follows Biden's recent announcement that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.</p>

Renee complied, stealing $360,000, and returned home to find her daughter safe.
