          <p>In an interview discussing her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her trailblazing career and the political challenges of today. She recounts facing racism, such as an incident with Senator Jesse Helms, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in American politics. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is not effectively countering Donald Trump and warns against the reversal of civil rights progress. Despite these challenges, she remains optimistic about the future of American democracy.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have identified the shipwreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse,' in 1721. The vessel was carrying a vast treasure, estimated to be worth over $138 million today, including gold, diamonds, and pearls. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure remains lost, tied to a cryptic message Levasseur allegedly threw to the crowd before his execution.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for Low Penalty Success Rate at Women's Euro 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:11:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 tournament has seen an unusually low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%, sparking analysis into the potential causes. Experts suggest a combination of factors, including increased pressure from the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight, which can negatively impact performance. Additionally, improved data analysis and scouting mean goalkeepers are better prepared, often knowing a player's preferred penalty style. The professionalization of the women's game has also led to physically more capable and smarter goalkeepers, making spot-kicks significantly more challenging to score than in previous tournaments.</p>

          <p>Following a court order, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The release comes after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, which argued the private foundation was subject to public records laws. The documents reveal the APF actively lobbied city council members to prevent a public referendum on the project, warning it could derail financing and damage the council's credibility. This ruling sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations across the country.</p>

          <h2>GLP-1 Weight Loss Drugs Show Promise as a Treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be effective in treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients have reported significant improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management after using these medications. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps rebalance hormones, particularly by lowering testosterone levels. While not yet an approved use, the findings offer hope for a condition that has seen few new primary therapies in nearly 50 years.</p>

          <p>A series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting initial tsunami warnings. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Russia's Emergencies Ministry issued alerts for coastal areas, including a watch for Hawaii. However, the warnings were later canceled after authorities determined that the danger of significant tsunami waves had passed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the seismic activity, which occurred near the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Superman's Creator and Comic Book Origins Were Rooted in Leftist Ideals</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent conservative criticism of Superman's portrayal as an immigrant overlooks the character's deeply leftist origins, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created in the 1930s by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original Superman was a "socialist figure" and a "Champion of the Oppressed." Early comics depicted him fighting corrupt capitalists, tearing down slums, and protecting the poor from authorities. This history contrasts sharply with the later, more patriotic "American way" version of the character, highlighting Superman's evolution as a metaphor reflecting the social and political concerns of each era.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran receiver Mike Williams, the Los Angeles Chargers' receiving corps is looking to its younger players to step up. Second-year receiver Quentin Johnston, a former first-round pick, is confident he can fill the void and deliver for the team. After a rookie season marked by drops, Johnston showed significant improvement last year and says his confidence is at an all-time high. With star rookie Ladd McConkey leading the group, the team is counting on Johnston and other young talents like rookie Tre' Harris to become reliable targets for quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>

          <h2>Critics and Writers Identify Film Adaptations That Surpassed Their Original Books</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While book-to-film adaptations are often met with skepticism, a selection of writers argues that some movies have successfully improved upon their source material. Films like 'Jurassic Park' and 'The Devil Wears Prada' are praised for tightening narratives, strengthening character arcs, and adding iconic dialogue not present in the original novels. Other examples cited include 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' which increased the story's suspense, and 'The Social Network,' which created a more compelling narrative by taking liberties with the facts. These adaptations demonstrate how cinema can elevate a story through different artistic and narrative choices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into England and Wales' waterways by 2030, part of what Environment Secretary Steve Reed calls a "water revolution." Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken," the plan includes tougher enforcement against water company executives, potentially including prison sentences for failing to meet standards. The pledge marks the first time a clear target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following widespread public anger. However, the government has ruled out nationalizing the industry, citing the high cost.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to hold their first joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military and diplomatic cooperation between the two neighbors. The drill, themed around joint border patrols, will take place in China's Guangxi region, which borders Vietnam. This development occurs as both nations seek closer ties, partly in response to the U.S. trade war. The exercise is part of a broader trend of increased defense cooperation this year, which also marks the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations.</p>
