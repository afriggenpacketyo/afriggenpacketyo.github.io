          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, Heart Lamp, the first book written in the Kannada language to win the prize. The stories, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, capture the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society. The win is expected to encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from dueling factions within the party. Conservatives seek steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose larger cuts to the program and demand adjustments to the state and local tax deduction. Despite the divisions, Republican leaders are racing to pass the budget package before a Memorial Day deadline. Trump urged Republicans to support the bill and address waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making it the 11th state with such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other options for end-of-life care and undergo two waiting periods and a second medical opinion. The law aims to provide compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice in the final moments of life.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks after Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered seven shutout innings. Despite Tanner Scott blowing a save in the ninth and Corbin Carroll hitting a two-run homer in the 10th, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the 10th. Tommy Edman's RBI double, intentional walks to Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman, and Max Muncy's sacrifice fly secured the win.

The test will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals that specialize in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The test is designed to detect amyloid, a protein that can build up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs. The process will be available to patients at a fraction of the cost of a PET scan.</p>

The project has been a priority for Mr. Trump since he took office. He promised during the campaign to build a defense system against foreign attacks similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome.</p>

          <p>Media coverage often focuses on young men supposedly voting for the far right, but a more significant shift is young women turning towards the left. Research shows that young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, with a sharp leftwing turn among young women. Center-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters, such as actions to fight the climate crisis and strengthen the welfare state, rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right.</p>

The EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is releasing the emergency funding as a "safety net for independent journalism."
