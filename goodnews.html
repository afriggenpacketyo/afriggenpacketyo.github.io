          <p>A 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, Arnald Gabriel, recently honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Gabriel, a former renowned conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, was unable to travel due to his declining health but was determined to fulfill his promise. He led the Illinois-based band remotely, demonstrating his commitment to his word and keeping perfect time despite his age. The event celebrated a lifetime of service and integrity, connecting him with the band he had guest-conducted since 1992.</p>

          <p>Recent clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, a fruit central to Indian summers. Two studies found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. Researchers emphasize that portion control is crucial and the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption. The studies offer a hopeful perspective for the millions in India with type 2 diabetes, suggesting the "king of fruits" can be part of a managed diet.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win features an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant, but with a notable alteration. The painting depicts Bryant's famous celebratory pose, but his Lakers jersey has been changed to a Dodgers jersey, a creative choice by the artist and the restaurant owner who commissioned the piece. While the mural also features key Dodgers players, the Bryant modification has generated mixed reactions from the public. The artist explained the decision was intended to honor Bryant's "Mamba mentality" while staying on theme with the Dodgers celebration.</p>

          <p>Iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the return of standalone physical stores, years after its parent company collapsed. Once a dominant force in youth fashion, the brand aims to recapture its "cool" factor and appeal to both nostalgic millennials and a new generation of Gen-Z shoppers. The relaunch includes a catwalk show and a strategy focused on its signature "London girl" aesthetic. However, industry experts note that Topshop faces a challenging retail landscape, stiff competition from fast-fashion giants, and the need to prove its relevance beyond nostalgia in order to succeed.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Premier League season with a dramatic 4-2 win against Bournemouth at Anfield, but the victory highlighted significant defensive vulnerabilities. New £70m striker Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another, becoming an instant fan favorite.

The match, filled with emotional tributes to the late Diogo Jota, showcased both the team's potent attack and the pressing need to address defensive issues.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck with a focus on affordability and customization. The company's strategy is to produce a simple, barebones vehicle to keep manufacturing costs low, allowing owners to add features and accessories from an "open source" marketplace. The company initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but that price point is now uncertain as those incentives are being rolled back. The key challenge for Slate will be to remain competitive against other models if its final price is closer to $30,000.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to significantly scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the pact, the city's police chief, Pamela Smith, will remain in command, reversing an earlier move to install a DEA administrator as the head of the force. The agreement was reached after D.C. filed a lawsuit and a federal judge signaled she would likely issue a restraining order against the administration's plan. This development de-escalates a tense power struggle over the control of local law enforcement in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Scottish jazz pianist Fergus McCreadie initially dismissed calls from Spike Lee as a potential scam before realizing the acclaimed film director genuinely wanted him to work on a new movie. McCreadie and his jazz trio were flown to New York to contribute to the score for the crime thriller "Highest 2 Lowest," starring Denzel Washington. Lee had personally flown to Edinburgh to watch McCreadie perform after hearing his music. The experience was surreal for the award-winning musician, who now hopes the high-profile collaboration will lead to more opportunities in film composition.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued from the Sequoia National Forest after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days.
