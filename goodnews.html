          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to hold interest rates steady this week, which will impact various financial aspects for consumers. Credit card rates remain high, prompting experts to suggest balance transfers or personal loans for those with good credit. Mortgage rates have remained relatively stable, keeping housing affordability a challenge. Auto loan rates are fixed but affected by rising car prices, while federal student loan rates are set annually and are somewhat shielded from Fed moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler families over the opioid crisis. The settlement resolves litigation against Purdue Pharma, which allegedly fueled addiction and overdose deaths through the aggressive marketing of opioid products. The agreement ends the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and bars them from opioid-related activities in the U.S. The funds will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs over the next 15 years, with a significant portion distributed in the first three years. </p>

          <p>JJ Spaun's victory at the US Open provided a positive conclusion to a tournament defined by challenging conditions and chaos at Oakmont. The course setup, with dense rough and slick greens, limited players' creativity and skill, raising questions about luck's influence on the outcome. Adam Scott described the course as "borderline unplayable" due to rain and difficult conditions. Despite Spaun's resilience, the tournament sparked debate about whether the course setup fairly tested the world's elite golfers. </p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has issued a warning about ticks due to the current warm weather, advising people to be tick aware when in grassy or wooded areas. If bitten, it's advised to remove the tick promptly using a tick removal device or fine-tipped tweezers, clean the area, and watch for a spreading bullseye rash, a symptom of Lyme disease. Precautions include using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers tucked into socks, and checking for ticks after being outdoors. Ticks can transmit pathogens, including Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. </p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The deal was finalized after both companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government, which includes a golden share for the U.S. government. This share grants the U.S. president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants. U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. </p>
