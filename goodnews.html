        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price rise is occurring despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, with which Bitcoin has typically correlated. This divergence suggests investors are seeking alternative stores of value, particularly in light of broader macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The article highlights Bitcoin's role as a hedge against fiat instability, attracting more investors amid economic uncertainty.</p>

Japan's real wages fell for the third straight year, but the government started a new gasoline subsidy to cut prices. North Korea fired multiple cruise missiles, and Kim Jong Un criticized officials over an accident during a destroyer launch. The Bank of Japan is urged to be cautious about raising interest rates, and a short film festival in Tokyo will spotlight tales of diversity and dystopia.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers, reminiscent of Reggie Miller's heroics, completed a stunning comeback against the New York Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, winning 138-135 in overtime. Aaron Nesmith hit six consecutive three-pointers, and Tyrese Haliburton made a game-tying shot at the end of regulation. Despite Jalen Brunson's 43 points, the Knicks squandered a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. The series is a rematch of last year's second round and a revival of the 1990s rivalry between the two teams.</p>
