          <h2>Stocks Surge on Trade Optimism Following UK-US Deal Announcement</h2>

          <p>Stocks experienced a significant rally driven by optimism surrounding a trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs seeing particularly strong gains. The rally was broad-based, with energy, industrials, banks, and consumer discretionary sectors leading the charge, fueled by the anticipation of reduced trade barriers and increased market access. Boeing shares rose following the U.K.'s agreement to purchase $10 billion in airplane parts, while Goldman Sachs shares climbed amid speculation that the trade deal could signal more agreements and reduced uncertainty in dealmaking. The positive sentiment reflects investor confidence in potential economic growth and improved trade relations.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its online pharmacy offerings to include pet prescriptions for dogs and cats through a partnership with Vetsource, adding hundreds of commonly prescribed medications to its U.S. site. Pet owners can now purchase prescriptions via Amazon's storefront, pending veterinarian approval, with Vetsource handling dispensing and delivery within two to six days. This move places Amazon in direct competition with Chewy and Walmart, as Amazon continues to grow its healthcare offerings, building on its 2020 launch of a digital drugstore and its acquisition of One Medical. This service aims to provide convenience and potentially lower costs for pet owners managing their pets' health needs.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her bid to have her appeal of her 2022 fraud conviction reheard, as the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals denied her request. This decision leaves the Supreme Court as her last option to overturn her conviction for wire fraud, for which she was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison in January 2023. The original conviction stemmed from Holmes defrauding investors in her failed blood-testing startup, Theranos, marking the end of a long legal battle.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on certain goods traded between the two countries, though Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports remain in place for most UK goods. The deal cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars annually, eliminates tariffs on steel and aluminum, and continues negotiations on pharmaceuticals. While Trump touted it as a major trade deal, it's a more limited agreement reversing some tariffs on specific goods, with months of negotiations and paperwork ahead. The deal also includes the UK purchasing $10 billion worth of Boeing planes from the US, but leaves the UK's digital services tax unchanged.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since imposing tariffs in April, which aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce trade barriers. The deal maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports but adjusts tariffs on UK autos, creating a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for US farmers and producers. While specifics are still being finalized, the agreement commits both countries to enhancing industrial and agricultural market access, streamlining customs procedures, and establishing commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment. Some experts, however, caution that the deal's impact is limited and may not be easily replicated with other nations.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden clarified on The View that his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is Presbyterian, not Catholic, after host Whoopi Goldberg mistakenly referred to them both as "devout Catholics." Jill Biden has previously addressed this misconception, noting her Presbyterian upbringing despite regularly attending mass with Joe. During the interview, Biden also defended his cognitive abilities, and Jill responded to accusations that she created a "cocoon" around him, while also addressing the hurtful comparisons made about her and Lady Macbeth.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 13:26:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt collectors are not always obligated to accept payment, even in good faith, which can be frustrating for individuals trying to resolve collection debt. A refused payment can occur if offering a partial payment, attempting to settle the debt, or if the account has escalated to legal action. It is important to negotiate with debt collectors by increasing the settlement offer or working with debt relief experts, considering a debt management plan, or evaluating if bankruptcy is the best option to wipe out collection debt quickly. Always keep records of attempted payments and communication with the debt collector as evidence of efforts to resolve the debt.</p>
