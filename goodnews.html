          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, starting their nearly 18-hour return to Earth. The crew, comprising two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, is scheduled for a splashdown off the coast of California. During their five-month mission, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, studying phenomena like plant growth in microgravity. Their departure concludes NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation, which had replaced a previous crew that was temporarily stranded on the station due to equipment issues.</p>

The model uses an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on shared interests and personality traits for an initial activity before mingling with the larger group. This initiative comes as studies show a decline in dating app usage and a corresponding rise in the popularity of real-life social events.

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly elevated genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a pivotal "gear shift" in his life. The discovery, made during a genetic test for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the finding prompted him to re-evaluate his life's purpose and focus more on his well-being and time with family. He has since become more involved in researching and understanding the topics explored in his show.</p>

          <h2>Economic Uncertainty Fuels 'Treatonomics' Trend of Spending on Small Luxuries and Experiences</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 22:11:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is reportedly booming as people seek morale boosts amid economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and inflation. This behavior involves spending on small, affordable luxuries like makeup and candles, or prioritizing larger, memorable experiences such as concerts, even while cutting back on daily expenses. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," reflects a shift in consumer values toward guilt-free moments of joy and personal well-being. Economists suggest this trend will likely persist as traditional life milestones like homeownership become less attainable for many generations. (not investment advice)</p>

The report notes a trend of significant value loss among many electric vehicles and models from luxury brands like Porsche and Mercedes, suggesting that the used car market currently prioritizes long-term reliability and practicality over novel technology or brand prestige.

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the harrowing Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. He is celebrated for his calm and courageous leadership during the 1970 flight, which famously turned a potential catastrophe into a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion. Lovell also flew on the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis." His legacy is remembered as a symbol of resilience, quick thinking, and grace under extreme pressure.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out inside the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba in southern Spain, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters, preventing a major disaster. The blaze reportedly started in a chapel within the Almanzor naves, with preliminary reports suggesting a short circuit from an electric sweeper as a possible cause. The mayor praised the rapid intervention that averted a catastrophe at the UNESCO World Heritage site. The building, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century, was converted into a cathedral after the Christian reconquest in the 13th century.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit, one of the world's most iconic commercial vehicles, is celebrating its 60th anniversary since first rolling off the production line on August 9, 1965. Originally a collaboration between Ford's UK and German engineers, the van became a staple for tradespeople and was famously used by rock bands and, according to police, bank robbers. Despite the closure of its UK plant in 2013, with production moving to Turkey, Ford's UK facilities remain central to its engineering and design. The brand is now focusing on electric and software-defined models for its future.</p>
