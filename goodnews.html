          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, slightly lowering its storm predictions but still anticipating above-normal activity. The new outlook projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine becoming hurricanes, including two to five major ones. Officials cite factors like neutral El Niño conditions and warmer ocean temperatures as drivers for the active season. The agency emphasizes the importance of preparedness for communities in storm-prone areas as the peak of the season approaches.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a historic peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the White House. The deal, the first ever signed between the two heads of state, aims to resolve decades of conflict between the neighboring former Soviet republics. As part of the pact, Armenia is reportedly set to grant the U.S. development rights to a new transit corridor intended to improve access to the West. This diplomatic effort is seen as a key step for Azerbaijan to potentially join the Abraham Accords in the future.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration's tariff policies create market volatility, financial strategists are offering advice on how investors can navigate the uncertain environment. While some recommend a long-term view, noting the stock market's historical resilience, others suggest tactical moves using tools like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to target specific sectors. Strategists note that sectors like utilities and financials, which are more service-oriented and U.S.-based, may be less exposed to tariff impacts than industrials or consumer discretionary goods. Despite the challenges, experts believe opportunities exist for those willing to look for them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has unveiled GPT-5, its newest AI model, which CEO Sam Altman claims possesses "PhD-level" expertise in various fields and feels more human-like to interact with. While the company promotes it as smarter and faster, some experts express skepticism, suggesting the launch may be driven by marketing hype in a competitive AI landscape. The BBC's own initial testing found the experience to be more of an evolution than a revolution in the technology. The model is now being rolled out to all users, who will soon determine if it lives up to its ambitious claims.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily oral obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight in a 72-week, late-stage trial. While the results were slightly below some analyst expectations, the company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by year-end, potentially launching it next year. The pill offers a needle-free alternative to popular injectable weight-loss drugs, though some doctors noted a higher rate of patients discontinuing treatment due to side effects like nausea. The company's stock fell on the news, while rival Novo Nordisk's shares rose.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has emerged as the new front-runner to be the next Fed chair, according to the prediction market Kalshi. His probability surged past 50% following reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with his policy views. Waller, who was nominated to the Fed by Trump in 2020, recently dissented on the decision to hold rates steady, arguing the approach was "overly cautious." His chances have now surpassed previous favorites Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett on multiple prediction platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. The move is seen as a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been pushing for greater access to the trillions of dollars held in defined contribution plans. While these assets have been common in pension funds, they have traditionally been excluded from 401(k)s due to higher risks, fees, and lack of transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

These funds, which have seen record inflows, offer the convenience of investing in digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum without needing a crypto wallet. However, the article cautions that the space is evolving rapidly with the introduction of high-risk leveraged products.

          <p>The global oil market is reacting with skepticism to President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on countries buying Russian energy, with oil prices closing lower after the announcement. Traders seem to believe the threat is a negotiating tactic and that the administration will ultimately back down to avoid a spike in energy prices. The administration already targeted India, Russia's largest oil customer, with a lower 25% tariff that has a 21-day delay, providing time for a deal. Analysts suggest that steep tariffs would jeopardize Trump's goal of keeping energy prices low. (not investment advice)</p>
