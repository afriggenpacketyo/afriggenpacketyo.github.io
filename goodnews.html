        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement allowing colleges and universities to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement, resolving three antitrust cases, permits schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and allocates $2.7 billion to former players denied revenue for years. Payouts will vary by sport and career length, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each, and the highest estimated payout reaching nearly $2 million due to "Lost NIL Opportunities." The settlement also establishes a clearinghouse to ensure NIL deals exceeding $600 are valued at fair market rates. </p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach towards Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. While his predecessor emphasized trilateral military cooperation with the U.S. and Japan, Lee is likely to seek a balance between these relationships. This shift has raised speculation about potential changes in Seoul's foreign policy towards the U.S., Japan, China, and North Korea, and how these countries will respond to this recalibration of political dynamics.</p>

          <p>Achieving longevity requires more than individual optimization through diet and exercise, as public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues. While personal health choices are important, societal factors such as public policy, infrastructure, and community play a crucial role in determining health outcomes. Sridhar emphasizes the need for collective responsibility in creating environments that support healthy living, advocating for policies that prioritize nutritious food, clean air, and preventive healthcare. Focusing solely on personal responsibility distracts from the broader systemic changes needed to improve overall health and longevity.</p>
