          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 10:28:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the second quarter, surpassing initial estimates and rebounding from a contraction in the first three months of 2025. This revised growth, reported by the Commerce Department, was fueled by increased business investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property, alongside stronger consumer spending. While AI investment is noted as a significant contributor, some analysts suggest the overall strength was partly an illusion, reflecting a sharp decline in imports following businesses' accelerated purchases in response to earlier tariffs. Concerns remain regarding a cooldown in hiring, prompting expectations for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts to bolster economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England captain Zoe Aldcroft has been ruled out of the Women's Rugby World Cup pool stage due to a knee injury sustained in the opening match against the United States. This marks her first absence from the squad since being appointed captain in January, with former captain Marlie Packer stepping in as skipper. Coach John Mitchell has made 13 changes for the upcoming game against Samoa, strategically resting several regular starters and integrating players returning from injury and World Cup debutants. Despite these significant lineup adjustments, the Red Roses, who thrashed the US 69-7 and are on a 28-game winning run, are expected to perform strongly and are in a good position to qualify for the knockout stages, demonstrating their squad depth.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its latest quarter, driven by a modest sales recovery and strong customer response to sales events, particularly for items like the Nintendo Switch 2. Despite this positive performance, the retailer maintained its full-year forecast due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business operations. CEO Corie Barry noted customers remain "resilient, but deal-focused," attracting them to promotions and new technology. The company is also expanding its third-party marketplace and in-store experiences to spur growth, navigating a challenging economic environment with higher interest rates affecting big-ticket purchases.

Despite the challenge of a broken thumb sustained last week and a fading voice, Rafferty persevered, concluding his set at 15:00 BST after starting at midday the previous day. He described himself as "buzzing" upon achieving the record and expressed aspirations to surpass the unofficial world record of 26 hours. This impressive feat, which required adherence to strict rules like avoiding song repetition within four hours, also served as a fundraising effort for a local Christmas toy appeal, highlighting his remarkable persistence and community spirit.</p>

This effort, which has evolved from low-tech to app-supported, aims to update the interactive Tree Map database, previously focused on street trees. The data collected is crucial for informing urban planning initiatives, including a goal to increase canopy cover to 30% by 2035 and address heat burden disparities in underserved neighborhoods. The census also highlights the city's progress in increasing tree diversity, with the current map logging 541 species compared to 70 in 1995, enhancing resilience against environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate imprisoned for 31 years, has been granted a new trial by a federal judge. His 1992 murder conviction for Thelma Bishop Roberts' death is now questioned by recent forensic tests revealing another man's DNA on the victim's body. Barbour, who recanted his confession alleging police coercion, has consistently maintained his innocence. The judge ruled that the prosecution violated Barbour's constitutional rights by failing to disclose initial forensics notes that excluded him and his alleged accomplice as DNA sources. The state plans to appeal the decision, but the ruling offers Barbour a chance to argue his innocence to a new jury.</p>

The company reported a 56% surge in quarterly sales to $46.74 billion, with adjusted earnings per share slightly topping analyst estimates. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that the AI revolution is in "full steam," projecting a massive $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. Analysts view Nvidia's results as consistent with its objectives, indicating solid growth and continued dominance in the AI infrastructure market, despite some data center revenue falling short of estimates.

          <p>Hamburg's Astra St Pauli Brewery has collaborated with Hela, a renowned producer of spiced curry ketchup, to create "Currydurst" – a limited-edition beer infused with the distinctive flavor of curry ketchup. This unique 6.5% alcohol brew serves as a homage to Hamburg's vibrant street food culture, particularly the iconic Currywurst, which is traditionally enjoyed with Astra beer. The partnership unites two legendary Hamburg brands, with Astra's origins tracing back to 1647 and Hela's famous curry ketchup debuting in 1963. Only 2,000 liters of the innovative "Currythirst" beer have been brewed, aiming to challenge consumer taste expectations and potentially establish itself as a new cult classic in the city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks nearly halved since 2005, a trend driven by large banks acquiring smaller institutions. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was lauded by the World Economic Forum as the soundest globally during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts suggest Canada's stability stems from its large players' collective economic strength. However, concerns are raised about market domination in the U.S., with former FDIC chair Sheila Bair warning that proposed lower capital requirements for big banks could lead to further consolidation, potentially hindering competition and innovation.

While national average rates vary, top-performing online banks frequently provide substantially better yields, especially for short-term CDs, reflecting the current inverted yield curve.

          <p>A new theory, presented in Madeleine Beekman's book "The Origin of Language," posits that the challenges of prehistoric child-rearing were central to the evolution of human language. Beekman argues that the need for cooperation and communication to care for vulnerable, large-brained infants spurred the development of vocal cords into complex language. This perspective shifts focus from male-dominated evolutionary theories to the crucial role of familial care. The article discusses how biological changes, coupled with infants' inherent "mind-reading" abilities, created a feedback loop where improved speech enhanced survival, suggesting language is both innate and acquired, and emphasizing interdependence.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering several property tax reforms ahead of the November Budget to address government borrowing and raise billions in revenue. Options include extending National Insurance tax to all landlords, removing capital gains tax relief for pricier main homes, and even abolishing stamp duty in favor of a new national proportional property tax. While these changes could generate significant funds, they are also controversial, with critics warning of potential negative impacts on housing transactions and local economies. The proposals highlight the government's challenge in finding revenue without raising income tax, national insurance, or VAT. (not investment advice)</p>
