        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced a delay in imposing retaliatory tariffs on American goods, pushing the deadline to August 1. This move provides a window for negotiations after President Trump threatened to implement new 30% tariffs on EU imports, citing persistent trade deficits as a national security concern. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated a preference for a negotiated solution but affirmed that the EU will remain prepared to enact countermeasures if a deal is not reached. The ongoing trade dispute creates uncertainty for the massive $2 trillion EU-U.S. trade relationship.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week is poised for significant market activity as second-quarter earnings season begins, with major financial institutions like BlackRock, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs set to report. Investors will be closely watching these reports for insights into investment banking, net interest income, and overall economic health. Additionally, crucial economic data, including the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), will be released. These figures will provide a clearer picture of inflation and potentially influence the Federal Reserve's future decisions on interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte as the administration considers a new strategy to support Ukraine. The plan involves selling advanced U.S. weapons to NATO allies, who would then transfer their existing, compatible military hardware to Kyiv. This approach aims to expedite the delivery of crucial aid to Ukrainian forces. The meeting also occurs as bipartisan senators push for legislation that would impose heavy sanctions and tariffs on Russia and any countries, like China and India, that continue to support its economy.</p>

          <p>Dustin Rhodes, a 56-year-old wrestling veteran, captured the vacated All Elite Wrestling (AEW) TNT Championship during the "All In: Texas" event. The title was put on the line in a four-way match after the previous champion, Adam Cole, had to relinquish it due to health issues. Rhodes secured the victory by pinning Daniel Garcia, marking his first championship win in AEW since joining the promotion in 2019. The emotional win makes Rhodes a triple champion, as he also currently holds two tag team titles in Ring of Honor (ROH).</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured his second victory of this year's Tour de France, winning stage nine in a tense sprint finish. The win came after a dramatic, day-long breakaway attempt by Dutch rider Mathieu van der Poel was caught just one kilometer from the finish line. Van der Poel's audacious effort nearly upended expectations for the flat stage, which has historically favored sprinters. Despite the exciting finish, the general classification remains unchanged, with Tadej Pogačar holding a 54-second lead over his nearest rival, Remco Evenepoel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant development for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle to introduce mandatory rest periods following discussions with the global players' union, Fifpro. The consensus includes ensuring a 72-hour gap between matches and providing a minimum three-week break for players at the end of each season. This agreement is a major victory for Fifpro, which had filed a lawsuit against FIFA, accusing the governing body of endangering player health by expanding the fixture calendar without proper consultation. The move is seen as a crucial first step in addressing issues of player burnout and injury.</p>

          <p>The decision by Republican Senator Thom Tillis not to seek re-election is set to make North Carolina's 2026 Senate race a highly competitive and unpredictable contest. His departure opens up a key seat that both political parties will view as a critical opportunity. Democrats are hopeful they can capture the seat in the perennially purple state, which has seen increasingly narrow margins in recent statewide elections. The race is now widely considered a toss-up, and it is expected to attract significant national attention and campaign spending from both sides as they vie for control of the Senate.</p>

          <p>A recently published study is renewing the scientific and public debate surrounding withdrawal symptoms experienced when patients discontinue antidepressant medications.

This contributes to an ongoing conversation within the medical community about the best practices for prescribing these medications and managing the process of cessation. The findings challenge previous understandings and highlight the need for more research and clearer patient guidance on the potential effects of stopping treatment.</p>

          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney, inadvertently pioneered the field of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that has revolutionized solving cold cases. Her work began by helping an adoptee find her family, which led to identifying a notorious serial killer. Rae-Venter famously used public DNA databases to unmask the Golden State Killer, providing the crucial lead that led to his arrest after decades of eluding law enforcement. Her method, which combines DNA analysis with traditional genealogical research, has since been adopted by law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve dozens of violent crimes.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has bolstered its security protocols with new technology. The agency has implemented a fleet of military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance and a system of mobile command posts to ensure seamless communication with local law enforcement. These upgrades directly address critical failures identified from the Butler incident, where a shooter used a commercial drone for surveillance and communication between agencies was fragmented. The new tools are intended to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that occurred that day.</p>

          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will be taking steps to make electric cars cheaper for people to purchase. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, she pointed to an upcoming announcement and a new £25 million package for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" to facilitate charging for homes without driveways. The move is intended to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind government-mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, largely due to their high upfront cost compared to traditional vehicles.</p>
