          <p>Philadelphia Eagles players, including Jordan Mailata and A.J. Brown, have minimized the significance of the "tush push" play as NFL owners prepare to discuss a potential ban. Mailata jokingly expressed his dislike for the name and indifference to the outcome of the vote, emphasizing the team's focus on installing offensive schemes. Coach Nick Sirianni acknowledged the upcoming decision and his feelings about it, while owner Jeffrey Lurie defended the play as a precision tactic. The tush push was used in a small percentage of plays last season.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing backlash for admitting he doesn't buy rice because he receives it from supporters, sparking public anger amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi as Eto's replacement. Eto's resignation is a setback for Ishiba ahead of an election, with public support for his Cabinet at its lowest level since he took office. Eto apologized for making inappropriate comments during a time of rising rice prices.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumour types from weeks to hours. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing has been described by surgeons as a "game changer" that could improve patient care and treatment. The method has already been used in 50 operations at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust with a 100% success rate. The faster diagnosis allows surgeons to perform more radical surgery during the initial procedure and enables patients to receive radiation or chemotherapy more quickly.</p>
