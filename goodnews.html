        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has moved forward with the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate certain cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The bipartisan measure aims to establish industry standards and protect consumers by mandating that stablecoin issuers hold reserves of underlying assets and prioritize repayment in case of bankruptcy. Supporters believe the act will legitimize the crypto industry and foster competition, while critics like Sen. Elizabeth Warren argue it's a weak set of regulations that fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns, especially those exemplified by President Trump's crypto ventures. The bill also includes a stipulation prohibiting members of Congress or senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoin products during their time in public service.</p>

          <p>Google is launching a new feature called A.I. Mode in its search engine, representing a major shift towards artificial intelligence. This new tool will function as a chatbot, enabling users to ask follow-up questions and receive comprehensive AI-generated answers. CEO Sundar Pichai describes it as a "total reimagining of search," intended to disrupt Google's traditional search business before AI competitors can. The A.I. transition also includes personalized email replies and a shopping tool that automates clothing purchases, but it comes amid antitrust pressures and concerns from web publishers about potential traffic disruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has outlined new regulatory guidance for Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring more rigorous clinical trials for healthy Americans. The agency will now demand randomized, placebo-controlled trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of boosters for adults and children without high-risk conditions. This decision reflects a shift towards balancing regulatory flexibility with gold-standard science, particularly for those at low risk of severe illness. For high-risk individuals, the FDA will continue to accept immunogenicity data as sufficient evidence for approval. This change comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is overhauling the nation's health agencies and immunization policy.</p>

          <p>Following President Biden's announcement of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, experts provided context on the diagnosis and treatment options. The doctors emphasized that while the cancer is advanced, modern treatments can effectively manage it for years. They noted that prostate cancer is common in older men and that screening guidelines often change after age 70. The standard treatment will likely involve androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to block testosterone production, which can slow the cancer's growth. They expressed optimism about Biden's prognosis, citing advancements in cancer research and treatment.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump visited Capitol Hill to rally House Republicans to support his "big, beautiful" tax bill, which includes $4.9 trillion in tax breaks. Despite Trump's efforts, some Republicans remain at odds over changes to healthcare and tax deductions, particularly the state and local tax (Salt) deduction. The bill proposes to triple the allowable Salt deduction for couples, which has irked Republicans in high-tax states like New York and California. While Trump downplayed dissent, some members have stated they will not support the bill as it stands, threatening its passage.</p>

The classification system also considers the patient‚Äôs social environment.

The FDA will require "randomized, placebo-controlled trials" before approving future applications to give shots to "all healthy persons" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old.
