          <h2>Researchers Use Sensor-Equipped Sharks to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are attaching sensors to sharks to gather crucial ocean data for improving hurricane forecasts. This innovative approach uses the animals as natural, wide-ranging ocean monitors to collect information on water temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane development. Researchers hope that by turning sharks into data collectors, they can access information from vast, otherwise inaccessible areas of the ocean more efficiently than with robotic gliders. The data will eventually be fed into computer models to enhance the accuracy of hurricane predictions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Boston Red Sox 5-2, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who had a run-scoring walk and a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak with multiple hits. The victory marked the team's third win in four games and provided a positive sign ahead of the upcoming trade deadline. The performance offered a hopeful turn after a period where the team averaged just three runs per game.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier talent from U.S. universities, capitalizing on stricter visa policies and academic funding cuts under the Trump administration.

This influx of brainpower is fueling the expansion and technological advancement of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which now represents the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market.

          <p>California state regulators have stipulated that any passenger service operated by Tesla, including its planned "friends and family" robotaxi service, must have a human driver in control. The California Public Utilities Commission clarified that Tesla's current permit only allows it to run a private car service with human drivers, not autonomous vehicles carrying the public. This clarification comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk teased an expansion of the service, which is currently in limited testing in Austin with safety supervisors present.</p>

          <p>A small business owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark battle against the cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the Leicester-based salon 'nkd', has been fighting L'Oréal's opposition to her trademark renewal since 2022. The French firm argues that 'nkd' is too similar to its 'Naked' line of beauty products and would cause consumer confusion. After spending over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell says she is ready to continue the fight at the upcoming Intellectual Property Office hearing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions have been ideal for these species, and a boom in aphids has provided a plentiful food source for predators like ladybirds. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, as wetland habitats dry up and fewer eggs may be laid.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The lawsuit argued that the city's limits on cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents were illegal and thwarted enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal. Chicago's mayor and the governor of Illinois both praised the decision, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's ordinance and supports public safety.</p>

          <p>This article explores Donald Trump's relationship with golf, portraying it as more than a hobby but as a core part of his business and political identity. It details his fiercely competitive nature on the course, his ownership of numerous high-profile golf properties, and how he uses the sport for networking with allies and world leaders. The piece contrasts his transactional use of golf with that of previous presidents, for whom it was more of a diversion from the pressures of office.</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Texas's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease, wildlife biologists have undertaken a rescue mission. The team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range. This relocation aims to establish a new, protected breeding population. Recent observations confirmed the sheep, including newborn lambs, are surviving and thriving in their new habitat, offering hope for the species' future in the state.</p>

          <p>This article investigates common health benchmarks like drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps a day. Experts weigh in on whether these targets are scientifically rigid or if there is flexibility, with some arguing that listening to your body's cues, like thirst, is often sufficient. The consensus suggests that while the guidelines are useful for general health awareness, a balanced and less rigid approach to a healthy lifestyle is often more practical and beneficial for most people.</p>
