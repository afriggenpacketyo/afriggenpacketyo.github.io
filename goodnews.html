          <p>This article provides guidance on safely repurposing old computers that are no longer supported by Windows updates, addressing the security risks associated with outdated operating systems. It advises users to either use the old PC offline, remove sensitive data, disable outdated browsers, or install strong antivirus software that supports legacy systems. The article also suggests repurposing options such as installing Linux, turning the PC into a home server, or donating it after securely wiping the hard drive. Simple hardware upgrades like adding RAM or switching to an SSD can further extend the life of an older machine.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a new strain of bacteria, named niallia tiangongensis, aboard the Tiangong space station, marking a significant discovery in understanding microbial adaptation to extreme space environments. The new strain, a variant of a known terrestrial bacteria, exhibits enhanced abilities to combat oxidative stress and reverse radiation-induced damage. Researchers suggest that decoding the survival mechanisms of this microbe could have implications for space technology, agriculture, and medicine, particularly in designing targeted control strategies for microbes.</p>

          <p>Colin Jost, the longest-running "Weekend Update" host on Saturday Night Live, has embraced his image as a stand-in for privileged white men in positions of power, becoming a comedic punching bag. He found success by accepting the public's disdain, allowing cast members like Sarah Sherman and Michael Che to mock him relentlessly, turning his perceived smugness into a pressure-release valve for cultural anxieties. By willingly taking the rhetorical chin, Jost has created a unique dynamic that endears him to audiences, signaling his self-awareness and making him a more sympathetic figure.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional figures showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. The trend is widespread across 45 states, driven by the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, and opioid-settlement funds. While synthetic opioid deaths are decreasing, deaths from stimulants are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution could threaten progress.
