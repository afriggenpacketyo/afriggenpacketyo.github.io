          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 10:26:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, experts anticipate further reductions this year, likely leading to lower home equity loan rates. These rates typically mirror the Fed's benchmark rate, with predictions suggesting two more cuts by year-end. This could bring average home equity loan rates below 8%, potentially reaching 7% in some markets, making borrowing more affordable for homeowners. Borrowers are advised to compare options from multiple lenders to secure the most competitive rates as these changes materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tucson, Arizona, is embroiled in a contentious battle over Project Blue, a proposed $3.6 billion data center that would be the largest development in Pima County. Residents and experts are pushing back against the project due to its immense water and electricity demands, especially in a desert region facing drought. Concerns also stem from a lack of transparency from the developer, Beale Infrastructure, and potential impacts on groundwater resources and the Santa Cruz River. Despite initial approval for land sale and rezoning, the city council unanimously voted to discontinue discussions with Beale, reflecting strong community opposition to the project's environmental implications.</p>
