          <p>A fact-check by Deutsche Welle has found President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C. to be misleading. While the city did experience a crime spike in 2023, the article notes that violent crime and homicides have seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025. The analysis also points out that comparing the crime rate of a city directly with that of entire states is an inappropriate statistical comparison, providing a more nuanced view of the current situation.</p>

The argument posits that direct government support is needed to revitalize the American chipmaker and reduce the nation's dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers. This move would align with the administration's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
