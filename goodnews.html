National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett noted that inflation has decreased even as tariff revenue has increased. The survey also revealed positive trends in employment and debt management, with fewer people expecting job loss and improved confidence in the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consolidating significant credit card debt can be challenging, especially when aiming to maintain a healthy credit score. Options include personal debt consolidation loans, home equity loans or HELOCs, and credit counseling agencies, each with its own benefits and considerations. Personal loans offer fixed monthly payments and potentially lower interest rates, while home equity options leverage property value for secured borrowing. Credit counseling agencies provide debt management plans with negotiated interest rates and consolidated payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lenders address frequently asked questions about home equity borrowing, including the differences between HELOCs and home equity loans, borrowing limits, rates, fees, and permissible uses of funds. HELOCs offer flexible credit lines with variable rates, while home equity loans provide lump sums with fixed rates. Borrowing amounts depend on home value and lender guidelines, with rates influenced by credit score and loan-to-value ratio. Funds can be used for various purposes, but borrowers should be aware of the risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

The party initially proposed limiting the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit or other means-tested benefits, which would have saved up to ¬£1.5 billion annually. However, this decision faced significant criticism and led to a series of adjustments, including expanding eligibility. Some sources suggest the government could have initially implemented a more comprehensive approach, while others cite concerns about the state of the Treasury's finances as the impetus for the initial proposal.</p>

          <p>Glendale announced it will terminate its contract to hold Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees, ending an 18-year agreement amid rising tensions over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The decision reflects the city's core values of public safety, transparency, and community trust, despite maintaining compliance with state law. The move comes after reports that Glendale continued the contract despite California's SB 54, which prohibits local funds from being used for federal immigration enforcement. The city acknowledges that public perception of the ICE contract had become divisive.</p>
