          <p>In response to falling prices and strong competition from imports, Beijing has announced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry. The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption by implementing a quality-grading system for Chinese beef. Officials noted that the current diet of Chinese residents is lacking in high-quality proteins, indicating significant potential for growth in consumption. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to enhance the appeal of domestic agricultural products and bolster key farming sectors.</p>

          <p>Recovery operations are ongoing across Scotland following significant disruption from Storm Floris, which caused power outages for approximately 50,000 homes and widespread travel cancellations. Utility company SSEN is working to restore electricity, describing the storm as the most damaging in recent memory, while Network Rail addresses numerous incidents on train lines caused by winds up to 90mph. The Scottish government has urged caution, and emergency services continue to clear debris and conduct safety checks. The storm also led to the cancellation of events, including the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and some Edinburgh Fringe Festival shows.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced a major defense deal to acquire 11 advanced warships from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement, described as the largest defense-industry pact between the two nations, is part of Australia's military restructuring to counter China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific. The Mogami-class frigates are stealthy, next-generation vessels equipped with long-range missile capabilities. This deal marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II and reflects a tightening strategic partnership between Australia and Japan, aiming to significantly expand Australia's naval fleet over the next decade.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties over allegations of improper hazardous waste disposal. The lawsuit claimed that the shipping company irresponsibly disposed of corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. According to the Riverside County district attorney's office, UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>As tarantula mating season arrives in California, experts are providing information on where the spiders are commonly spotted and how to interact with them safely. From August to December, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, making them more visible in areas like Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. While their appearance can be alarming, scientists emphasize that native tarantulas are shy, reluctant to bite, and not dangerous to humans unless provoked. Their primary defense is flicking irritant hairs, so officials advise observing them from a distance to avoid stressing the animals.</p>

          <p>Stephen J. Cloobeck, a wealthy businessman and first-time candidate for California governor, is launching a $1.4 million television advertising campaign. The ad buy covers every major California market as well as national political hubs like Washington, D.C., and New York City. This early and significant spending is aimed at increasing his name recognition in a crowded field without a clear front-runner, especially after former Vice President Kamala Harris opted out of the race. Cloobeck, a long-time Democratic donor, is positioning himself as a "conservative Democrat" who will fight for all Californians.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position on the council. The invitation followed Trump's reestablishment of the Presidential Fitness Test and his praise for Barkley, with whom he has previously golfed. Barkley, who has also golfed with former President Obama, pushed back against criticism for associating with politicians, stating that he respects the office of the presidency.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The research team, working in partnership with local cave explorers, also found evidence of the site being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These discoveries are part of a larger heritage project aimed at understanding the long history of human farming and land use on the fells. The findings shed new light on the prehistoric inhabitants of the area and highlight the crucial role cavers play in uncovering subterranean history.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45 to 49 is linked to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates in this group grew 62% from 2019 to 2023, while early-stage cancer incidence jumped 12% annually from 2019 to 2022. Researchers called the findings promising news, as earlier detection improves treatment outcomes. However, they also warned that screening rates in this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was primarily driven by the impressive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies. He argued that despite weak labor data, the market's resilience stems from the fundamental strength of firms like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, which he described as cash-rich "nation states." Cramer highlighted flawless performance in cloud computing, massive user engagement at Meta, and strong growth across Google's divisions. He suggested that even with some mixed results, the overall power and diverse revenue streams of these tech titans make them a dominant and unbeatable force in the current market.

          <p>A Birmingham woman whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered in 2020 by a partner with a legally held firearm has expressed hope over new, stricter gun control laws in the UK. Emma Ambler has campaigned for tighter regulations since the tragedy, in which the perpetrator had lied on his application about his mental health history. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun applications and mandate that police investigate an applicant's domestic situation for signs of abuse or dishonesty. Ambler believes these changes are a meaningful step toward preventing similar tragedies in the future.</p>

The 41-year-old actor says the new season moves beyond just physical tests to include learning new skills and confronting deep-seated fears. Hemsworth reflects on how a genetic test in season one, which revealed a high predisposition for Alzheimer's disease, motivated him to prioritize his health. He also discusses his philosophy on aging, distinguishing between healthy living and extreme biohacking, and embracing the inevitability of death as a reminder to appreciate life.</p>

Bonta stated this represents a return of over $33,000 for every dollar of special funding invested by the legislature for this purpose. The majority of the savings came from a single lawsuit that successfully blocked an administration effort to freeze federal funding. Bonta's office has filed 37 lawsuits and numerous legal briefs challenging the administration on issues ranging from healthcare and education funding to immigration and voting access.

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the medical tourism market with an ambitious new plan. The local government aims to attract over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027 and introduce dozens of international innovative drugs and devices each year. This strategic push comes as a key competitor, South Korea, is set to remove value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery, potentially diminishing its appeal. In the first quarter of 2025, Hainan's special medical tourism zone already saw a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in visitors seeking treatment.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued new guidance recommending that people stopping obesity jabs like Wegovy receive structured support for at least a year. This advice addresses the common issue of patients regaining significant weight after they stop taking the medication. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and suggests patients need a plan that includes healthy eating, exercise, and behavioral support to maintain their weight loss. While an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these jabs, most pay privately and will not be eligible for this NHS support.</p>
