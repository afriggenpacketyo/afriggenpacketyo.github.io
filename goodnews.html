          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated unexpected strength by adding 147,000 nonfarm payrolls in June, exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, although this was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate. Wage growth remained moderate, with average hourly earnings increasing by 3.7% year-over-year. The robust report has led markets to significantly reduce the probability of a July interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a busy July 4th holiday, the U.S. airline industry is bracing for a challenging second half of the year due to an oversupply of flights and weakening demand. Several major carriers, including Southwest and Delta, have pulled their 2025 forecasts amid economic uncertainty and have started to cut unprofitable routes. While millions are traveling, average domestic airfares are down 3% from last year, indicating a softer market.

          <p>A new political coalition, the Africa Democratic Congress (ADC), has been formed in Nigeria with the goal of unseating President Bola Tinubu in the 2027 general election. The coalition brings together prominent opposition figures like Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar, who cite the country's worsening economic conditions and security challenges as key motivators. While the new party aims to unite a fragmented opposition, President Tinubu's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has dismissed it as a group of "retired politicians." The move comes as many Nigerians grapple with high inflation and insecurity under Tinubu's economic reforms.</p>

          <p>British financial markets experienced a brief period of turmoil after Chancellor Rachel Reeves was seen crying during a parliamentary debate. The incident, where Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not immediately defend her position, led to a spike in U.K. bond yields and a drop in the pound as traders speculated about her potential resignation and the stability of the government's fiscal policy. Government officials later attributed her distress to a "personal matter," and the Prime Minister publicly reaffirmed his full support. Markets appeared to stabilize following these assurances of political unity and commitment to existing fiscal rules.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted two significant housing bills aimed at boosting construction by reforming the state's environmental review process. The new laws exempt most urban, multifamily housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often used to delay or block development through litigation. This move, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is seen as a major victory for the "Yes in My Backyard" (YIMBY) movement and a philosophical shift for Democrats toward prioritizing housing abundance. The reforms passed despite opposition from some environmental and labor groups, signaling a new focus on tackling the state's severe housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, frontman of the band Dropkick Murphys, is using his platform to challenge what he sees as the co-opting of working-class identity by the MAGA movement. In an article for The Atlantic, he recounts a recent concert where he engaged with a Trump supporter, wagering that the fan's MAGA merchandise was not American-made, which it wasn't. Casey expresses frustration that his band's pro-worker, anti-bully stance is now viewed by some as "elite" or partisan. He argues for pushing back against political division and believes more artists should speak out during this critical political moment.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox explores the growing parental desire for kids to have a "lazy summer" with less structured time, reminiscent of the 1990s, versus the current reality dominated by screens and parental work schedules. While the idea of fostering independence and saving on camp costs is appealing, the ubiquity of smartphones and platforms like YouTube Shorts has fundamentally changed unstructured downtime. Experts note that while kids have less free time and are more supervised than in the past, some digital activities like gaming can still offer benefits. The piece suggests that a completely screen-free, unsupervised summer is largely unrealistic for most modern families.</p>

          <p>Casey Johnston's new book, "A Physical Education," chronicles her journey from calorie-counting cardio to strength training, reframing fitness as a pursuit of growth rather than shrinkage. The book serves as a critique of pervasive diet culture, arguing that weight lifting offers a way to build a positive relationship with one's body by focusing on function and capability. It emphasizes the importance of proper nutrition, not restriction, to fuel muscle growth and build strength. The article reviews this as a powerful counternarrative to the often-toxic messages directed at women regarding exercise and body image.</p>
