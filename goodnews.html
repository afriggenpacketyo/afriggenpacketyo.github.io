          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after making a controversial remark about receiving so much rice from supporters that he doesn't need to buy any, which sparked public outrage amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in response to the backlash. The incident occurred shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices. This situation has added to the challenges faced by the Ishiba government ahead of a parliamentary election.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article discusses callable CDs, a type of certificate of deposit that allows the bank to redeem it before the full term, typically offering higher interest rates. Experts suggest that callable CDs can be worthwhile if the rate is significantly higher than traditional CDs and if investors have a solid reinvestment strategy. However, they may not be suitable for those seeking stability or those without a plan for reinvesting the funds if the CD is called early. The article advises comparing various savings options to maximize returns while considering individual financial goals and risk tolerance (not investment advice).</p>

While the virus can cause serious illness in rare cases, there have been no human cases acquired in the UK to date, though there have been cases linked to travel. This detection is not unexpected due to the virus's prevalence in Europe, and is part of a wider trend of mosquito-borne diseases expanding to new areas due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has announced that the top-selling RAV4 SUV will be exclusively offered as a hybrid model as part of its redesign, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. This decision is driven by the increasing popularity of hybrid vehicles and growing customer demand. The 2026 Toyota RAV4 will include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with hybrid technologies, aligning with Toyota's commitment to electrified vehicles. However, the company faces challenges related to tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts, as a significant portion of its U.S. sales come from vehicles manufactured outside the U.S.</p>

Target reported a drop in sales for the most recent quarter, citing consumer concerns about tariffs and a boycott over the company's DEI policy rollback.
