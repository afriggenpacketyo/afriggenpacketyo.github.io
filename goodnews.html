          <p>While clearing their yard, a couple in New Orleans unearthed a marble slab that was later identified as a 1,900-year-old Roman tombstone. The relic, dedicated to a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus, is believed to have been missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, since it was destroyed during World War II. After consulting with university experts, the couple turned the artifact over to the FBI's art crime team to facilitate its repatriation. The discovery has prompted an investigation into how the ancient grave marker traveled from Italy to a Louisiana backyard, with speculation that it may have been taken by a soldier after the war.</p>

          <p>Sungrow Power Supply, the world's largest manufacturer of solar inverters and energy storage systems, has filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Hefei-based company, which already trades on the Shenzhen stock exchange, holds a significant global market share in both of its key product areas. The move to list in Hong Kong comes as the company navigates new import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese-made solar and energy storage equipment. These tariffs, which were recently lowered but are expected to rise again, create a challenging trade environment for Chinese green energy firms expanding into international markets.

          <p>Police in the UK have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled an international criminal network believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China over the past year. The investigation, the largest of its kind in the UK, began after a victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, where nearly 900 other stolen devices were discovered. Authorities believe the gang may handle up to half of all phones stolen in London, where phone theft has nearly tripled in four years. The high demand and profitability of unlocked Western phones in China are seen as major drivers of the crime surge.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index hit a record high for the second day in a row, driven by a rally in technology stocks on Wall Street. The surge was largely influenced by a major deal between OpenAI and chipmaker AMD, which is seen as a significant challenge to industry leader Nvidia. While chip-related stocks on the Nikkei showed volatile trading, the overall index was also boosted by political stability following the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of the ruling party. Meanwhile, Japanese Government Bond yields also rose to multi-decade highs, reflecting broader shifts in the country's financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to significantly reduce energy consumption. The facility houses servers in a 1,300-tonne cabin submerged 35 meters deep, using the natural cooling properties of seawater to lower operational costs compared to land-based centers. This initial phase is part of a larger plan to build a subsea data hub with 100 cabins, positioning it as a key component of the region's strategy to develop new technologies for the blue economy. The project highlights China's innovative approach to managing the immense energy demands of digital infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, will be visible on the night of October 7th. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, known as the perigee, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon is the full moon that falls closest to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers. Skywatchers can look forward to two more supermoons this year, occurring on November 5th and December 4th, offering more opportunities to observe the amplified lunar spectacle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of real estate company Opendoor Technologies have soared by 400% in 2025, with much of the gain occurring after the appointment of new CEO Kaz Nejatian. The company, which operates a large-scale house-flipping business, has historically struggled with profitability. Nejatian, a former Shopify executive, plans to leverage artificial intelligence to cut costs and improve the company's home-buying and selling decisions, a strategy that has generated significant investor excitement. While there is potential for this AI-driven overhaul to succeed, its success is not guaranteed, presenting a considerable risk for the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8 percent, up from a previous prediction of 4 percent, citing the positive effects of government stimulus measures. This upgrade comes despite escalating trade tensions with the United States, which have seen tariffs on Chinese goods more than double this year. China's export growth, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe, has helped offset a domestic slowdown caused by a slump in the real estate sector and weak consumer spending. However, the World Bank expects China's growth to slow to 4.2% in 2026 as export momentum fades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has announced that the UK is now its largest market outside of China, following an 880% year-over-year increase in sales for the month of September. The company sold over 11,000 cars, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model. This sales boom coincides with a record high for EV sales in the UK, a market that has become particularly attractive to Chinese automakers because it has not imposed the high tariffs seen in the EU and the US. BYD's success highlights the growing presence and competitiveness of Chinese brands in the global automotive industry.</p>
