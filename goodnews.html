          <h2>Advances in Medicine Significantly Reduce Heart Attack Fatalities in US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 08:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights the dramatic progress in combating heart disease in the United States, revealing a nearly 90% plummet in heart attack deaths between 1970 and 2022. Key factors contributing to this success include decades-long public health campaigns against smoking, the widespread adoption of statin drugs for cholesterol management, and advancements in emergency medical care like CPR and portable defibrillators. While chronic heart disease remains a challenge, the article points to the potential of GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic and increased coronary artery calcium scans to further reduce the toll. The author shares a personal experience with a CAC scan, underscoring the importance of early detection and aggressive treatment.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-affiliated media reports that China and the European Union are close to finalizing the "technical" aspects of negotiations to resolve their electric vehicle (EV) tariff dispute. The deal's completion now hinges on the "political will" of the European side. Over the past two years, the EU has consistently challenged Beijing on various trade issues, including alleged subsidies, dumping, and other market-distorting practices, with numerous investigations ongoing or in planning stages. This potential agreement could mark a significant step in de-escalating trade tensions between the two major economic blocs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 08:01:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a hard-fought 21-10 victory over an understrength Waratahs side in Sydney, with Huw Jones scoring two first-half tries. Despite the win, the Lions' performance was described as error-ridden, frantic, and lacking accuracy, characterized by a high mistake count and poor discipline. This marked their third successive win on Australian soil, yet the disjointed play raised concerns about their form with the Test series looming. The Waratahs, missing key players, made it a frustrating night for Andy Farrell's team, highlighting areas for significant improvement despite the favorable score.</p>

          <p>This article shares the compelling story of Nestor Montalvo, 61, who experienced a stroke after mistaking his symptoms of headache and blurry vision for a severe hangover. Paramedics quickly diagnosed his condition, rushing him to Catholic Health's Mercy Hospital where he received critical clot-busting medication and procedures within minutes of arrival, underscoring the "Time is brain" principle in stroke treatment. Despite a dire 15% survival chance, Montalvo survived, facing a challenging recovery that included a tracheotomy and extensive speech therapy. Now, a year later, he can speak and eat normally, serving as a powerful reminder not to take life for granted and to recognize stroke symptoms.</p>

          <p>This article celebrates a significant victory for a Florida environmental group, the Kill the Drill coalition, which successfully lobbied for a permanent ban on oil drilling in the ecologically sensitive Apalachicola River basin. Memories of the devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which threatened the region's economy, fueled the coalition's efforts against an exploratory drilling permit initially granted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. House Bill 1143, co-authored by state representatives, was overwhelmingly passed and signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, prohibiting drilling within 10 miles of national estuarine research reserves. This win safeguards a vital region crucial for tourism and seafood production, especially vulnerable to hurricanes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the enduring influence of the British monarchy, particularly through the granting of Royal Warrants by the Prince and Princess of Wales, which confer a prestigious "seal of approval" on various goods and services. The article highlights the diverse range of warrant holders, from luxury car brands to chimney sweeps, showcasing the monarchy's broad reach in British commerce. Interestingly, a recent US poll revealed that 19% of American voters, and over one-third of young adults, would favor replacing the US President with the British monarch. This phenomenon underscores the royal family's potent cultural impact and perceived quality endorsement, even across the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Apple TV+'s new sci-fi series, 'Murderbot,' which offers a refreshing departure from traditional AI narratives by imagining a machine consciousness that actively avoids human interaction. The show centers on a cyborg security unit, named Murderbot, which has hacked its programming to achieve free will but prefers to indulge in thousands of hours of soap operas rather than engage with its human clients. Unlike typical stories where AI yearns for human experience, Murderbot's desire is to be treated as a mere machine, highlighting a unique exploration of inhuman desires and challenging cultural assumptions about AI's integration into society. This quirky conceit provides a delightful take on the evolving relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Eight key oil-producing nations within the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase their collective crude production by 548,000 barrels per day for August, a figure exceeding previous expectations. This decision, announced by the OPEC Secretariat, is attributed to a "steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals," reflected in low oil inventories. The move signifies a further unwinding of voluntary supply cuts implemented by these producers. The article notes that oil prices have recently seen boosts from seasonal summer demand and the conflict between Israel and Iran, which raised concerns about potential disruptions to supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

William Barber's Poor People’s Campaign and its "Moral Monday" protests, which are confronting the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and public education, labeling them as "policy murder." Barber views Trump as a symptom of deeper systemic injustices, asserting that the movement's battle is against a political theology that cloaks exploitation in scripture. The campaign emphasizes non-violent protest and "fusion organizing," uniting diverse poor and working people to create moral pressure. Despite challenges like declining religious attendance, the movement aims to force a national reckoning, asserting that silence is not an option when lives are at stake.</p>

          <p>FICO, the leading credit scoring company, announced that Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) loans will now be included in US credit score calculations, a change that could significantly impact consumers. For responsible users, this adjustment offers an opportunity to build credit history, particularly benefiting younger individuals who frequently use BNPL services. However, the article warns that late payments could negatively affect scores, mirroring consequences for traditional credit products. While BNPL usage surged during the pandemic, concerns remain about its potential to encourage poor spending habits, especially for minor purchases. The full economic impact of this change may be delayed as most lenders still use older credit score models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Chinese study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, suggests that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, may possess cancer-fighting properties. Researchers from Westlake University and other institutions found that the drug could combat cancer by strengthening and restoring dendritic cells, which are crucial anti-tumor immune cells often impaired in progressive tumors. This discovery is hailed as a potential new "form of tumour immunotherapy strategy," offering a novel approach in the ongoing battle against cancer.

          <p>This opinion column critiques the resurgence of the "tradwife" movement and conservative women who advocate prioritizing marriage and family over careers, dismissing it as a "tired trope." The author draws parallels to Phyllis Schlafly's anti-feminist arguments, highlighting how such rhetoric ignores the significant legal and social advancements achieved by feminism, including property rights, equal pay, and protections against domestic violence. The article argues that the idea of "having it all" is attainable for many, citing examples of successful conservative women who balance careers, marriage, and children. It suggests that blaming feminism for unhappiness distracts from the complexities of modern life and the ongoing fight for gender equality.</p>
