        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Humberto has intensified into a Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic, but there are no immediate coastal watches or warnings for the U.S. The storm is located approximately 390 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and is moving west with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. While it is not expected to make landfall, it could bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast. Forecasters are also monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean that could develop into a tropical depression. </p>

          <h2>Hurricane Humberto Interaction With Another Storm Could Cause Fujiwhara Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 22:54:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the possibility of Hurricane Humberto interacting with another developing storm in the western Atlantic, potentially leading to the Fujiwhara effect. This rare phenomenon involves two storms merging and becoming entangled around a common center. The likelihood of this occurring depends on the strength and size of each storm; a weaker system might be absorbed by a stronger one. Forecasters expect Humberto to move northwest and strengthen, while the second storm is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas, increasing the chances of storm surge and rainfall in the southeastern U.S. The article suggests that any interaction between the storms might slightly alter their expected paths. </p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell discusses her upcoming film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," aiming to capture the primal and sexual feelings she experienced reading the book as a teenager. Fennell, known for her provocative style in films like "Saltburn," wants the film to be an emotional response to the novel, highlighting its complexity and singular nature. She added risqué elements based on her teenage memories of the book, and cast Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi in leading roles. The film is scheduled for release on Valentine's Day next year. </p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio provides a unique space for teen boys to openly discuss their struggles through a program called Men's Work. Led by Johnny Cole and David Reese, the program challenges traditional notions of masculinity and encourages emotional expression. The sessions aim to counter messaging from the "manosphere" and promote healthy coping mechanisms. A survey indicates that teen boys are less comfortable than girls discussing their mental health. The program seeks to offer a more loving way to move forward. </p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify any federal records about Amelia Earhart, whose 1937 disappearance has captivated the public for decades. A lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands urged Trump to release the records, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" that Earhart was spotted on Saipan. Theories surrounding Earhart's disappearance range from her being on a spy mission to simply running out of fuel. Previously released FBI documents reveal a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript citing Navy files on Earhart. </p>
