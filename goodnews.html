          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign to address the "disruptive behavior" of passengers who play music and make calls on mobile phone loudspeakers. Research found that 70% of surveyed travelers consider such noise a nuisance, with some finding it very stressful, particularly those with heightened sensitivities like autism. Posters and social media posts will encourage the use of headphones or hands-free kits on the Elizabeth line and other services. This initiative aims to foster a more considerate and stress-free environment for all commuters.</p>

          <p>China is set to significantly expand its carbon market by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, to include major polluting industries beyond power generators. This ambitious plan introduces tougher standards by setting absolute limits on emissions, rather than the current carbon intensity caps. The move underscores China's determination to meet its climate targets and aims to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market. This article highlights a crucial step in China's environmental policy, impacting global efforts to combat climate change. (not investment advice)</p>
