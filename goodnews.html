          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the Building Energy Act, aiming to abolish operating bans on older gas boilers to restore market calm. While prioritizing energy supply security, the government plans to construct new gas-fired power plants, though critics like Claudia Kemfert argue this is excessive. Despite concerns over weakening climate protection, the government has committed to a significant infrastructure investment program, with ‚Ç¨100 billion allocated for climate protection, secured by the Greens. Carsten Schneider, the new Environment Minister, faces the challenge of advancing climate foreign policy amidst these shifts, with expectations to save global climate protection despite Trump.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's victory in the Romanian presidential election was significantly influenced by record numbers of ethnic Hungarian and Moldovan voters. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing decisively to his lead. This support was particularly notable given Hungarian PM Viktor Orban's backing of hard-right candidate George Simion, who holds anti-Hungarian views. Romania's ethnic Hungarians prioritized the preservation of liberal democracy, while Moldovans rejected Simion's idea of reunification with Romania.</p>

          <p>The government has postponed the release of its child poverty strategy, initially scheduled for spring, until later in the year, possibly coinciding with the Budget. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering various measures, including the controversial two-child benefit cap, which restricts benefits for families with more than two children. Critics condemn the delay, warning that it could push more children into poverty, while others suggest the delay may allow for a more effective strategy to be developed. The government insists it remains committed to reducing child poverty.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade deal with the US based on mutual respect rather than threats, following US President Donald Trump's proposal to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods. European governments warned that higher tariffs would harm both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward. The EU is one of Washington's largest trading partners, with substantial trade volumes. Trump expressed impatience with the trade negotiations, stating his tariff plan would be implemented on June 1 unless a European company made a large investment in the US.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices for consumers. The goal is to make rice available in stores at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms, addressing concerns about soaring prices. The government will explore online sales and negotiate contracts with retailers. The move comes amid criticism that the government has failed to curb rising rice prices, which have hurt households as inflation outpaces wage growth. (not investment advice)</p>
