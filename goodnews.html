          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ruled that her continued detention violated her First Amendment rights. Ozturk was arrested for co-authoring an opinion piece critical of Israel and was accused by the Department of Homeland Security of supporting Hamas, which she denies. Judge William Sessions stated there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence by Ozturk and her detention could chill the speech of millions of non-citizens. The ACLU and Tufts University expressed their delight at her release and welcomed her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a recently fired commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), is prepared to challenge his dismissal in court, arguing it is illegal. Trumka's firing came after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency, fearing it would compromise product safety. Consumer Reports and several Democratic senators have condemned the firings, calling them an attack on the independence of the CPSC, which regulates the safety of consumer products and handles recalls. The White House maintains the president has the right to fire employees in the executive branch.</p>
