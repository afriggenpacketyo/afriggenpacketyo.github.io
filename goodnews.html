        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a deal valued at nearly £60 million. The 26-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract, is the club's second major summer acquisition. The transfer was the culmination of a year-long pursuit by Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who was a strong admirer of the player's abilities. The deal involved complex negotiations, including Arsenal's preference to pay over the release clause to structure the payments and fending off interest from Liverpool and a potential move to Real Madrid.</p>

          <p>Actress Jenilee Harrison, known for her role in "Three’s Company," recently revealed that she refused to pose nude for her 1987 Playboy photoshoot. In a new podcast, Harrison explained that her contract explicitly stated she would remain clothed, a detail that surprised the photographer and required the production to halt and find a wardrobe for her. She joins a select group of celebrities like Dolly Parton who appeared in the magazine without undressing. Harrison reflected on her discomfort with being a sex symbol, viewing it as a role she had to play for her career in Hollywood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary is being hailed as a major success for ranked-choice voting (RCV). The system allowed the Working Families party to endorse a slate of four progressive candidates instead of being forced to consolidate behind one, preventing infighting and allowing a long-shot candidate like Mamdani to build momentum. RCV encourages coalition-building and more positive, issue-focused campaigns, as candidates appeal for second-choice votes. High voter satisfaction and turnout in New York suggest that the system empowers voters and can lead to more engaging and representative democratic outcomes.</p>

          <p>A federal advisory committee has recommended that flu shots be made without thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been a target of vaccine safety critics. This move comes despite a long history of safe use and scientific consensus that it causes no harm, as it contains a form of mercury that is quickly expelled by the body. Thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001, and its discredited link to autism has been repeatedly disproven by numerous studies. Since 94% of current flu shots are already thimerosal-free, the practical impact of the recommendation is expected to be minimal for the public.</p>

          <h2>The Evolving Relationship Between Black Americans and the National Flag</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Black artists and cultural figures are increasingly engaging with the American flag, prompting a broader conversation about the complex relationship between Black Americans and the national symbol. Ted Johnson, a retired Navy commander and columnist, explains that for many, the flag represents both a history of oppression and a set of ideals worth fighting for, a duality deeply felt by Black service members throughout history. The recent reclamation of the flag by figures like Beyoncé is seen by some as a powerful statement of ownership and belonging, asserting that "this is home." This trend reflects a generational shift and a growing pride in what Black people have accomplished in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Mark Rowley, has called for a major overhaul of policing in the United Kingdom, arguing the current model is outdated and inefficient. He proposes consolidating the 43 police forces in England and Wales into 12-15 larger, regional "mega" forces to improve efficiency and make better use of limited funding. Rowley criticized the political focus on officer numbers over investment in technology, which he says hinders the ability to combat modern crime. The call for reform comes amid falling public confidence and financial strain on police forces following years of austerity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of services for families, from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, in an effort to support children in disadvantaged areas. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson described the initiative as a "lifeline" for families, building on a previous Conservative policy but expanding its reach. The opposition has criticized the announcement, questioning how much of the plan is genuinely new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights the uniquely deep military relationship between China and Tanzania, which is described as unparalleled elsewhere in Africa. According to the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies, Tanzania's military structure, doctrine, and equipment are heavily influenced by China's People's Liberation Army. This close bond is rooted in historical ties, as Tanzania is one of several African nations where a liberation movement party has maintained power since independence. These nations, including Mozambique and Zimbabwe, have cultivated the strongest relationships with Beijing on the continent, fostering significant military and political alignment.</p>

          <p>Whitewater rafting enthusiasts are protesting Southern California Edison's operations on the Kern River, arguing that water diversions for a hydropower plant are leaving a 16-mile stretch of the river unrunnable. To raise awareness, a group of boaters recently carried a raft on foot along the dewatered section of the river. They are demanding that the utility leave more water in the river as it seeks to renew its federal license for the Kern River No. 3 plant. A decision on the new license could mandate higher flows for recreation, which would benefit the local tourism economy.</p>

          <p>A unique and long-standing relationship exists between the CIA and Hollywood, with talent and inspiration often flowing in both directions. The intelligence agency has historically collaborated with entertainment industry professionals, from makeup artists to magicians, to solve complex espionage challenges, such as creating disguises or deception techniques. This collaboration continues today, with the CIA assisting on film and book projects to ensure accuracy and inspire recruitment. Famous declassified missions like the "Canadian Caper," depicted in the film "Argo," highlight how Hollywood creativity has been instrumental in real-world spycraft.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall early Sunday morning near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm, which had briefly strengthened before reaching the coast, is bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to the Carolinas. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for a portion of the coastline, including Myrtle Beach, with forecasts of 2 to 4 inches of rain and potential for localized flash flooding. Chantal is expected to weaken as it moves further inland, likely becoming a tropical depression later today before dissipating on Monday.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a new, more efficient data sorting system that could significantly advance fields like artificial intelligence and scientific computing. The system uses memristors, a type of electronic component with memory capabilities, to perform "sort-in-memory" operations, overcoming the traditional speed limitations of computing architecture. This approach avoids the so-called Von Neumann bottleneck, where data transfer between memory and processing units slows down performance. The researchers successfully built a hardware prototype that demonstrated notable improvements in both speed and energy efficiency for tasks like route finding.</p>

The clinical trial, conducted by researchers at Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet, treated children and adults with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene. The therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a healthy copy of the gene to the inner ear, restoring the protein needed to transmit sound signals to the brain. All ten participants showed significant hearing improvement, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly all of her hearing.</p>
