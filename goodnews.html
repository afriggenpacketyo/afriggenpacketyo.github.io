          <p>In his new memoir, "Who Knew," TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller shares insights from his career, including the importance of instinct over excessive data analysis. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he helped popularize the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," emphasizing the value of simple human instinct in making creative and business decisions. He argues that relying too heavily on data can narrow one's perspective, while instinct and common sense are essential for identifying good ideas and ensuring their success. The article highlights Diller's belief in the power of instinct.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly set to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar during his upcoming trip to the Middle East. U.S. officials may convert the plane into a potential presidential aircraft. The gift is expected to be announced during Trump's visit to Qatar, with the plane potentially serving as a new version of Air Force One until near the end of his term. This raises questions about the legality of accepting such a large gift from a foreign government.</p>

While the government touts the island's U.S. jurisdiction, tax incentives, and skilled workforce, it acknowledges challenges such as chronic power outages and costly shipping regulations.

          <p>While artificial intelligence is advancing, it is not yet capable of replacing workers in most industries, particularly in small and mid-sized businesses. Generative AI platforms are useful tools for search and information retrieval, but they are not reliable enough for core business operations. Building AI systems is expensive, requires giving up data to large tech companies, and the technology is still immature. Though AI will eventually transform the workplace, that day is still years away, and businesses should avoid prematurely laying off employees based on the current state of AI.</p>
