          <p>Uber has unveiled several new features designed to make travel more affordable and convenient for commuters. One key feature is 'Route Share,' which allows users to save money on regular routes by sharing rides with up to two other passengers and walking a short distance. These shared routes will run every twenty minutes during peak hours in select cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago. Additionally, Uber is introducing prepaid ride passes and special deals for UberOne members. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi emphasized that these innovations aim to put people at the center by making travel easier, more predictable, and more affordable, following the company's recent shift to profitability.</p>

          <p>Shares of stock brokerage platform eToro experienced a significant surge in their Nasdaq debut, climbing 40% after the company's IPO raised nearly $310 million. The stock opened at $69.69, 34% above its initial offering price of $52, giving the company a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. This successful IPO is being closely watched by Wall Street as a sign of renewed interest in IPOs after a period of market uncertainty. eToro, founded in 2007, had previously attempted to go public in 2021 via a SPAC merger but shelved those plans due to unfavorable market conditions.</p>

          <p>A judge in Virginia has ordered the immediate release of Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen and postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, who was detained for two months by immigration officials over alleged visa violations. The order came amidst growing legal challenges to the Trump administration's targeting of foreign academics with pro-Palestinian activism. Suri's lawyers argued that he was targeted due to his marriage to a U.S. citizen of Palestinian descent and his support for Palestinian rights. This case is one of several where academics legally studying in the U.S. have been targeted, raising concerns about freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have finalized a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways to sell up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's "largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order." The deal, which includes 787 Dreamliners and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, was struck during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates that this agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over one million total domestic jobs throughout the production and delivery period. This significant order could provide a boost for Boeing, which has faced financial challenges in recent years due to safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and trade disruptions.</p>
