        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is set to significantly increase its defense spending, signaling a commitment to modernize its armed forces and address growing global threats. Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans for new nuclear-powered attack submarines, enhanced weapon production, and a strengthened cyber command. This initiative is intended to send a strong message to Russia and reassure NATO allies of Britain's dedication to collective security. The government aims to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and an ambition of 3% before 2034, although funding sources remain unclear, as the focus is on deterring Russia while investing in domestic manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>Trading has resumed on the Damascus Securities Exchange after a six-month closure, signaling Syria's efforts to rebuild its economy following years of civil war. The reopening is part of a broader strategy by the country's new leaders to attract investment and stimulate economic development. The move coincides with the easing of international restrictions on Syria's financial systems, as the United States and Europe have lifted some sanctions. A recent $7 billion power deal with Qatari, Turkish, and U.S. companies aims to revitalize Syria's war-battered electricity grid, marking another step towards economic recovery.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is preparing to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone later this month, aiming to strengthen its naval defenses against increasing pressure from mainland China. Developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, the drone will undergo combat capability evaluations before further testing later this year. The island's defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, with plans to begin mass production in 2026. The army intends to acquire more than 200 of these AI-equipped vessels to support coastal assault operations, enhancing Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy.</p>

This strategy reflects a shift in how wars are waged, with technology playing an increasingly crucial role in defense and offense. The success of these operations underscores the importance of investing in and developing advanced drone capabilities for national security.</p>

The White House is launching an "all-out advocacy effort," sending administration officials to Capitol Hill and potentially to states, to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Key sticking points include concerns over the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, which Trump insists will only target waste, fraud, and abuse. With narrow majorities in both chambers, Republicans are using reconciliation to pass the bill, requiring adherence to the Byrd rule.</p>
