        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap, policies they aim to fund by cutting net-zero projects and asylum seeker hotels. This announcement intensifies the policy divisions within Labour, as Prime Minister Starmer faces pressure from his own party to address these issues. The current winter fuel payment scheme restricts the top-up to only those receiving pension credit, while the two-child benefit cap affects approximately 1.5 million families. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the proposals as unaffordable promises, adding to the political debate surrounding these welfare policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American economy has demonstrated surprising resilience despite facing a series of shocks over the past five years, including a pandemic, recession, and trade war, leading some to call this period the "era of thrash." While uncertainty typically dampens investment and slows growth, corporate profits remain high, unemployment is low, and new businesses are flourishing. Experts attribute this resilience to factors such as the coronavirus crisis disrupting markets and government responses like near-zero interest rates and trillions in support to families and companies. However, there are concerns that the economy is becoming more vulnerable due to rising interest rates, high personal debt levels, and political instability.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing calls for police reform, with Police Chief Brian O'Hara implementing changes to improve safety and community relations. Despite a decline in shootings, violent crime rates remain high in Minneapolis compared to other major cities. O'Hara is focused on restoring pride within the police force, adjusting arrest tactics, and enhancing community engagement and officer training. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of six police agencies, including Minneapolis, but O'Hara assures that reform efforts will continue, even without federal oversight.</p>

          <p>A competitive barbecue chef shares five simple side dishes ideal for summer cookouts, including stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, Hasselback potatoes, Mexican street corn on the cob, and watermelon salad. Josh Cooper, owner of Cooper's Next Level BBQ, suggests using Parmesan cheese, garlic, and panko breadcrumbs for the stuffed mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes, basil, herbs, and spices for the bruschetta. For Hasselback potatoes, he recommends Yukon golds with olive oil, rosemary, and thyme, while Mexican street corn benefits from Katia cheese, mayonnaise, Mexican cream, and lime juice. He also advocates for a refreshing watermelon salad with red onions, feta cheese, fresh mint, and aged balsamic vinegar.</p>

          <p>A senior editor reflects on her enjoyment of Nathan Fielder's series, 'The Rehearsal,' which stages rehearsals to help people prepare for difficult moments. Initially hesitant due to discomfort with Fielder's previous work, the editor found the show to be thought-provoking and humorous, appreciating its exploration of comedy's potential to effect real-life change. The series pairs Fielder‚Äôs monotonous tone with outrageous conceits, but this time, the premise is staging ‚Äúrehearsals‚Äù to help people prepare for difficult moments. Though he‚Äôs still cringey (and still allegedly misleading real people), he also poses questions about how comedy can effect real-life change, and reveals some insights about his own role in the entertainment industry‚Äôs worst impulses.</p>

          <h2>Volunteers Remove Invasive Plants to Restore L.A. River Habitat</h2>

          <p>Volunteers gathered to remove invasive black mustard plants from the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve in Los Angeles, aiming to restore native plant species and improve the ecosystem. The black mustard crowds out native plants crucial for wildlife and is less effective at filtering runoff. The effort is part of an ongoing habitat restoration project by Friends of the Los Angeles River, with volunteers using mapping software to track their progress. The event drew increased participation, possibly due to recent wildfires, as people sought tangible ways to help the environment.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Inherited IRAs: Rules and Strategies</h2>

          <p>This article explains the rules and strategies surrounding inherited IRAs, noting that the SECURE Act largely eliminated the "stretch IRA," requiring most non-spouse beneficiaries to drain inherited IRAs within 10 years. Special rules apply to spouses, allowing them to treat the IRA as their own, but this doesn't apply to "doubly inherited" IRAs. The article also offers advice to someone in their late 50s who is financially unprepared for retirement, suggesting they prioritize maximizing Social Security benefits, delaying retirement, and seeking a fee-only financial planner (not investment advice).</p>
