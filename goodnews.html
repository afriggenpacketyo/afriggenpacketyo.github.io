          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., replacing Ed Martin after his nomination faced Senate opposition. Pirro, a former judge and district attorney, has been a staunch Trump ally and defender, even amidst controversies and false statements regarding the 2020 election. Her appointment has stirred debate given her lack of recent law enforcement experience and past involvement in election fraud claims. Pirro will also be stepping down from her role at Fox News to take on this new position, with Martin being reassigned to a role focusing on alleged government 'weaponization'.</p>

          <p>Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary, "Pavements," examines the indie-rock band Pavement's influence and legacy through various creative mediums. The article details how the film combines tour footage with staged elements like a Broadway musical and a faux-Hollywood biopic to capture the band's essence. The film explores the band's history from their suburban roots to their rise in the 90s, including cultural moments like touring with Sonic Youth and being mocked by Beavis and Butt-Head. Perry's approach allows him to imagine Pavement as a cultural force, even rewriting their history, and ultimately validating the belief that Malkmus' songs can transcend their original form.</p>
