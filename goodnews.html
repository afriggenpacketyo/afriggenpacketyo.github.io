          <p>Nvidia is set to release its Q2 fiscal 2026 earnings on August 27, with high anticipation as the AI giant is a market bellwether. The article notes Nvidia's strong track record of exceeding earnings estimates in 18 of the last 20 quarters, but cautions that an "earnings beat" does not guarantee a stock price increase. Investors are particularly focused on Q3 guidance, which should include H20 chip sales to China, though recent reports suggest a potential halt in production due to Chinese security concerns.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police reported "far fewer" incidents of serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to recent years, despite 423 arrests over two days. There were two stabbings, neither resulting in serious injury, a significant reduction from eight stabbings and one death last year. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed the improvement to proactive measures like live facial recognition (LFR), metal detectors, and stop-and-search, which targeted individuals attempting to cause harm. This article highlights a positive trend in public safety at a major cultural event, though the Met's use of LFR technology continues to face criticism from civil liberty groups.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Ford's announcement of a new $30,000 electric pickup truck signals that former President Trump will not ultimately win his fight against electric vehicles, despite his efforts to roll back incentives. While US EV sales have slowed and Trump aims to halt programs like the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits, global EV adoption is accelerating, with over half of new cars in China being electric or hybrids. Ford's ambitious bet on an affordable EV platform, targeting 2027 deliveries, reflects an industry commitment to electrification for global competitiveness, regardless of US policy shifts.

          <p>Famed Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb is proposing that 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, could be an "extraterrestrial artifact" or even an "alien mothership," despite most astronomers believing it is a comet. Loeb points to lingering questions, such as its lack of a cometary tail despite approaching the sun, and its highly unusual trajectory along the solar system's orbital plane, which he calculates as a one-in-500 chance. This article details a controversial hypothesis challenging conventional astronomical explanations and pushing for open-minded exploration of interstellar visitors, suggesting humanity needs a "wakeup call" to explore beyond Earth.</p>
