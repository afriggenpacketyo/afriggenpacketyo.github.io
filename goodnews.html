          <p>A New Yorker, known as "Streeter," earns over six figures annually by reporting vehicles idling illegally in the city.  New York City's law prohibits idling for more than three minutes, but enforcement is lax, creating an opportunity for citizens to report violations and receive a portion of the fines.  This program has generated nearly $70 million for the city, but has also drawn criticism from the trucking industry, which argues the law is overly burdensome and doesn't account for the complexities of truck operation in New York City.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government announced a five-pronged plan to combat the spread of New World screwworms, including an $8.5 million facility in Texas to breed and release sterile flies.  This initiative aims to prevent the flies from infesting livestock and other animals. The plan also involves converting a fruit fly facility near the Mexican border into a screwworm breeding center, although that won't be ready for 18 months. This is a significant effort to prevent a resurgence of this dangerous parasite, which was largely eradicated in the U.S. in the 1960s.</p>
