        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy is gaining momentum, driven by the surging power requirements of artificial intelligence and data centers, with tech giants actively investing in the sector. Despite its potential as a reliable, 24/7 clean energy source, the industry faces significant hurdles, including vast capital requirements, long construction times, and an uncertain regulatory climate. Experts suggest that substantial government backing will be essential for financing large-scale nuclear projects, as the private sector's risk appetite remains limited. Projections show investments in the nuclear value chain could reach $2.2 trillion by 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volkswagen is aiming to solidify its dominance in the European electric vehicle market by introducing a new family of affordable, compact EVs. The German automaker, already Europe's top EV supplier, recently unveiled its ID. Cross Concept car, which is slated for a market release next year with an entry price around 25,000 euros. CEO Oliver Blume stated that this new lineup represents a strategic push to expand the company's 28% market share in electromobility. The announcement comes as European carmakers prepare to compete with new Chinese entrants at the IAA Mobility show in Munich.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has extended its gold-buying streak, increasing its holdings to 74.02 million ounces in a strategic move to diversify its reserves amid growing geopolitical risks. This sustained purchasing has contributed to a rise in gold prices and increased the precious metal's share of China's total foreign reserves to a record 7.64%. The trend reflects a broader global shift among central banks seeking alternatives to US dollar-backed assets, with a recent survey indicating that 95% of central banks expect global gold reserves to continue increasing over the next year.

          <p>The European Union Agency for Asylum reported a 23% drop in asylum applications during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. This significant reduction was primarily driven by a 66% decrease in applications from Syrian nationals. The agency attributes this trend not to EU policy changes but to the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has fostered hope among many displaced individuals about returning to their home country. Germany, previously the top destination for asylum seekers, saw the largest decline in applications, followed by Italy and Spain.</p>

          <p>Cyprus has initiated discussions with the United Arab Emirates regarding potential investment and partnership in a major subsea power cable project designed to link the power grids of Israel, Cyprus, and Greece. Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides confirmed the outreach, emphasizing his country's commitment to the 1.9 billion euro project. This development comes shortly after European prosecutors launched an investigation into possible criminal offenses related to the project's financing and delays. The proposed cable would be the world's longest and deepest high-voltage subsea power link.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Monday, with investor attention focused on a critical confidence vote in France that Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected to lose. The vote was called by Bayrou himself amid political gridlock over proposed budget cuts, and his potential ousting could force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years. In corporate news, Dutch semiconductor firm ASML has reportedly made a significant investment in French AI startup Mistral AI. The positive market open follows a weaker close in the U.S. last week.</p>

While no longer the dynamic player of his MVP years, Rodgers demonstrated a willingness to adapt his game, operating effectively within the Steelers' system.
