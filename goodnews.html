          <p>Spotify has announced a major leadership transition, with co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek stepping down from his role to become executive chairman, effective January 1, 2026. He will be replaced by current co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, who will serve as co-CEOs. Ek stated the change formalizes the company's existing operational structure and that his new role will focus on long-term strategy. The announcement caused a temporary 6% dip in Spotify's stock, which remains up 54% year-to-date for the $140 billion company.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's market capitalization exceeded $4.5 trillion after its stock reached a new record high, driven by a series of significant artificial intelligence infrastructure agreements. The chipmaker's recent deals include taking an equity stake in OpenAI and partnering with Oracle on a $500 billion "Stargate" data center project. Additionally, cloud provider CoreWeave, in which Nvidia is a major shareholder, secured a $14.2 billion deal to supply Meta with AI infrastructure. These developments have solidified Nvidia's central role in the AI boom, with its stock up approximately 39% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The Obama-era program, which protects immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation, has been closed to new applicants since 2021 due to legal challenges. Under the new plan, approved applicants outside of Texas will receive deportation protections and work permits. However, due to a ruling specific to Texas, approved residents of that state will only be granted deportation deferrals, not work authorization.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United head coach Eddie Howe has dismissed comments from Bayern Munich's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who called Newcastle "idiots" for paying a £69m transfer fee for striker Nick Woltemade. Howe stated that the criticism is "irrelevant" and that transfer fees are dictated by market forces, not by any single club's opinion. He defended the club's investment, highlighting that Woltemade has started strong with two goals in three games despite having little training time. Howe emphasized that the player's performance on the field, not the price tag, is what ultimately matters for the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the threat of imprisonment, Russia's underground music scene is growing as a form of political protest against the Kremlin's war and deepening repression. Musicians perform anti-war songs in public spaces, echoing the role artists played during the final years of the Soviet Union. The government has responded by arresting performers and labeling them as foreign agents, but these attempts at suppression often backfire, making the banned music even more popular. This cultural resistance offers a rare sign of hope for young Russians disheartened by the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Recent decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to open the floodgates for a wave of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly in the cryptocurrency space. The SEC approved generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, which will accelerate the launch of funds for digital currencies like Solana and XRP beyond the existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Separately, the agency granted approval for traditional mutual fund companies to offer their portfolios as an ETF share class, a move that could add thousands of new ETF tickers to the market as numerous firms have pending applications.

          <p>President Trump announced that Pfizer has agreed to offer significant discounts on many of its prescription drugs for all American consumers and will provide medications to Medicaid at lower prices. The move is a result of the administration's "most favored nation" executive order, which aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other high-income countries. The discounted drugs will be available through a new federal website called "TrumpRx." Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla stated the agreement helps reverse an "unfair situation" where Americans disproportionately covered the costs of global medical innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arianna Huffington, founder of Huffington Post and CEO of Thrive Global, argues that the belief linking overwork to success is a dangerous "collective delusion." Drawing from her personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion and burnout in 2007, she advocates for a cultural shift away from celebrating constant work. Huffington emphasizes that scientific data shows people are more effective and creative when they allow themselves time to recharge. Through her company, she promotes the use of "micro steps"—small, incremental changes—to build healthier habits rather than relying on unsustainable New Year's resolutions.</p>

For the first time, Gen Z men are now more likely to attend church than their female counterparts.

          <p>Modern soccer is increasingly adopting structured, choreographed tactics reminiscent of American football, particularly in set-pieces like corners and throw-ins. This season, 28.4% of Premier League goals have come from set-pieces, the highest percentage in a decade. Teams like Arsenal, managed by Mikel Arteta, are using pre-determined player movements, blocking, and screening techniques that resemble the NFL's "rub routes" and basketball's screens to create space and scoring opportunities. This shift towards more structured play allows managers to exert greater control over game outcomes, mirroring the play-by-play strategic nature of the NFL.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Excessive credit card debt is not defined by a specific dollar amount but rather by its impact on an individual's financial health. Key indicators include a debt-to-income ratio for credit cards exceeding 10%, a credit utilization ratio above 30%, and the inability to pay more than the minimum monthly payment. If debt is causing significant stress or preventing other financial goals, it is considered excessive. To manage this, strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche methods, balance transfers to 0% APR cards, and debt consolidation loans can be effective in regaining control over finances.</p>
