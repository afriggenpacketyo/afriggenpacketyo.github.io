          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016. Dyer, who struggled with fame and addiction, had initially planned to leave the facility but reconsidered after reading the letter. He reflected on the pain he caused his family and committed to treatment, marking a turning point in his life. Dyer, known for roles in 'Human Traffic' and 'EastEnders,' acknowledged making 'a lot of bad decisions' and using drugs during his career, but says he is now focused on his family.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that the oral medication zongertinib shows promise in treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The medication outperformed the standard treatment option, intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, while also carrying fewer risks of adverse effects. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted at 82 sites worldwide and included 188 NSCLC patients, with a majority from Asian populations. Zongertinib targets the HER2 protein, blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signaling cell growth.</p>

          <p>Sany Heavy Industry, a major Chinese heavy equipment manufacturer, plans to use funds from its proposed Hong Kong IPO to expand its global sales and service networks. The company aims to more than double its overseas revenue to 100 billion yuan in the next three years, driven by strong demand from developing countries in Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa. Sany's globalization strategy focuses on building localized marketing channels rather than constructing new factories. In 2024, overseas revenue accounted for nearly 65% of Sany's total revenue, highlighting the importance of international markets to the company's growth.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated the redevelopment of a two-kilometer expressway surrounding the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, scheduled for completion by the 2040s.

Modeled after New York City's High Line, the project aims to become a tourist attraction with benches, public bathrooms, cafes, and event spaces. The project faces challenges such as managing summer heat and ensuring the structure can support the weight of the soil and plant life.</p>

This loss highlights a concerning trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records since their 8-0 start to the season.

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the 'big tent' party, speaking at a town hall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Gallego argued that the party has become too exclusive, 'kicking people out of the tent' who don't align perfectly with its message. He cited Joe Rogan as an example of someone Democrats 'canceled,' limiting their reach to a broader audience. Gallego, who represents a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need to form alliances with people they may not agree with 100% of the time.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler based in Bedford, UK, is promoting the health benefits of platonic touch through 'cuddle puddles' and one-to-one cuddle therapy. Wood believes that human touch boosts serotonin and oxytocin levels, while lowering cortisol, and can help those with nervous system issues, PTSD, or loneliness. The service is fully clothed and platonic, with clients screened and consent forms signed to ensure boundaries are respected. While some experts emphasize the importance of familiarity in touch, Wood believes that professional cuddling can provide a safe and nurturing environment for those seeking connection.</p>

The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain across Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with isolated spots potentially seeing up to 12 inches. While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western US, this event is due to a 'cutoff low,' diverting the jet stream eastward. The precipitation could alleviate recent droughts in some areas, but also poses a risk of flooding in low-lying areas.</p>

          <p>Five fishermen, three Peruvians and two Colombians, were rescued by a tuna boat after spending 55 days adrift at sea and arrived in the Galapagos Islands. The fishermen had been missing since mid-March after their boat's alternator failed, causing communication and navigation tools to malfunction. To survive, they drank rain and parboiled passing fish. The men are reported to be in stable condition, and authorities are coordinating their return to their respective countries.</p>
