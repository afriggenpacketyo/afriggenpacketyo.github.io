          <h2>Appeals Court Temporarily Blocks Order for Trump to Return Control of California National Guard</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 23:56:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily blocked a lower court's order that would have instructed President Trump to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Newsom. The initial order deemed Trump's federalization of the Guard illegal, but the appeals court intervened, scheduling a hearing to consider whether to extend the stay. The legal battle arose after Trump federalized 4,000 Guard members and mobilized Marines in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles, a move Newsom challenged as an overreach of presidential authority and a violation of the Tenth Amendment. The case highlights the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California regarding immigration enforcement and the use of military forces on city streets. Optimism score is based on the article focusing on the legal process and checks on executive power. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration can continue deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles while an appeals court considers the administration's appeal. This decision temporarily halts a judge's ruling that would have returned control of the Guard to Governor Newsom. The initial ruling found that California was likely to succeed in its challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, arguing that Trump circumvented Newsom and violated the Constitution. The legal battle stems from Trump's deployment of over 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to assist immigration agents, prompting protests and raising concerns about the militarization of law enforcement. This decision by the appeals court sets the stage for further legal arguments regarding the president's authority and the role of the military in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers rallied from a 3-0 deficit to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-4 in overtime in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final, tying the series. Leon Draisaitl scored the game-winning goal in overtime, marking his fourth overtime goal of the playoffs. The Oilers became the first road team in over a century to come back from down three goals in the final. Goaltender Calvin Pickard, who replaced Stuart Skinner, made crucial saves to facilitate the comeback after the Oilers starter allowed three goals on 17 shots in the first period. The series is now tied, with Game 5 scheduled in Edmonton.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers discovered structures resembling red blood cells linked to a tumor in the fossilized remains of a Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus dinosaur. This finding suggests that soft tissue can be preserved in fossils more often than previously thought, offering insights into ancient diseases. The discovery could be crucial in understanding cancer mechanisms and how they have evolved, potentially informing new approaches to cancer prevention or treatment in humans. The study emphasizes the importance of long-term fossil conservation efforts to ensure future researchers have access to specimens for molecular investigations.</p>

          <p>Dan Wang characterizes China as an "engineering state" due to its extensive infrastructure development and emphasis on STEM education. China's rapid construction of subways, high-speed rail, dams, and bridges surpasses other nations. The country's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those in the US, and many top officials are engineers. This focus on engineering is considered a matter of national security and priority in China, contrasting with the US, which Wang describes as a "lawyerly state."</p>
