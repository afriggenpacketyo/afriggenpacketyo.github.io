        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's recent announcements about expanding Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified the company's limitations within the state. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that Tesla is not authorized to operate autonomous vehicles for public transport, with or without payment, and any service must include a human driver. This comes as Tesla notified the state of its plans to offer a "friends and family" car service in the Bay Area. The distinction highlights the regulatory hurdles Tesla faces in deploying its "Full Self-Driving" technology for ride-hailing, a market where competitors like Waymo have already secured driverless permits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its "draconian" decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi for one game. The suspension was enacted after Messi, along with teammate Jordi Alba, missed the MLS All-Star game, citing a need for rest. According to league rules, players who skip the event without prior approval are ineligible for their club's next match. Mas argued that the punishment is unfair, especially considering the league's scheduling, while MLS Commissioner Don Garber defended the enforcement of the long-standing policy but agreed to reevaluate it in the future.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey, commencing a more than seven-year prison sentence. He pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges after admitting he fabricated large parts of his life story to defraud voters and donors. Prosecutors detailed how he used campaign funds for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox, while presenting false financial disclosures to Congress. Following his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed on social media to President Trump for a future pardon, framing his sentence as politically motivated, although the White House has declined to comment.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her prolonged trademark dispute with the global cosmetics company L'Oréal. The conflict began when she attempted to re-register the trademark for her business, "nkd," which L'Oréal opposed, citing potential consumer confusion with its "Naked" product line. The salon owner, who has already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of operation. Despite the stress and financial toll, she remains determined to fight the corporate giant, stating she believes L'Oréal expects her to give up.</p>

          <h2>UK Insect Populations Experience Boom Following Record Warm and Sunny Spring</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in certain insect populations, such as ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following the warmest and sunniest spring on record. The boom is partly attributed to a surge in aphids, a primary food source, which thrived in the warm conditions. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by affecting egg-laying and drying out wetlands. This short-term boom contrasts with long-term research suggesting a general decline in the UK's overall flying insect population, highlighting the complex effects of changing weather patterns.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's ordinance illegally restricts local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration agents and sharing information. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago's mayor and Illinois's governor both praised the decision, affirming that the city's welcoming ordinance is lawful and enhances public safety by allowing police to focus on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement, which they termed a reckless and inhumane agenda.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It details the immense pressure on creatives to "name names" to save their careers, a chilling period that impacted not only famous figures but also many ordinary Americans. The display raises important questions about free speech, privacy, and the consequences of political persecution.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores President Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a competitive outlet, and a tool for political networking. Unlike other presidents who used golf as a diversion, Trump's involvement is deeply transactional, from owning numerous high-profile courses to using the sport to forge connections with world leaders and political allies. The article notes his intense focus and competitiveness on the course, as recounted by former staff. It also touches on the financial performance of his golf properties and the way he uses the exclusive environment of the sport for private meetings away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The disease, spread by non-native animals, wiped out about half of the native sheep. In a rescue mission, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a sign of hope for the species' future in the region.</p>

          <p>A feature article investigates the science and practicality behind popular health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. Experts offer nuanced perspectives, suggesting that while these benchmarks are useful guidelines, strict adherence may not be necessary for everyone. For instance, one kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration, while a sleep expert emphasizes that consistently getting less than seven hours of sleep has proven negative health consequences. The overall message encourages a balanced, less rigid approach, focusing on consistency and adapting recommendations to individual lifestyles rather than fixating on specific numbers.</p>

He criticized the current representative's record and recent Republican-led redistricting, which he called "cheating."

          <p>Twenty-five years after its debut, reality television may have a more positive impact on society than its critics suggest, according to some sociologists and psychologists. The genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering viewers a glimpse into different social landscapes and perspectives. This exposure can help build social understanding and even overcome biases. By showing raw, unfiltered emotions and tackling controversial subjects like coercive control, reality TV can spark national conversations and help viewers feel less isolated in their own experiences, despite the ethical concerns surrounding the welfare of its participants, which are now being addressed by regulators.</p>

An analysis explores the multi-million dollar ecosystem behind the genre, which often mirrors mainstream styles but without "objectionable content." Experts note the rise of a "barstool conversion rock" sound, blending masculinity, conservative politics, and country music. The economic engine of megachurches, which provides plug-and-play resources for smaller churches to replicate their worship experience, is a major driver of this trend, raising questions about what this faith-flavored boom says about the current cultural and political moment.</p>

The funds, intended for programs like educator training and arts education, were frozen after the White House claimed it found instances of misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda." The move to withhold the funds triggered widespread outrage from educators and a rare pushback from ten Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell. They argued the freeze denied states the ability to support students and families with long-standing, bipartisan programs, ultimately leading to the administration's reversal.</p>
