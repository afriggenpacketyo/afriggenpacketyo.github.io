          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decrease in tourism due to inflation, which has raised prices for visitors, with casual trips showing a decline. Convention traffic has remained steady, but the city is seeing fewer international tourists, who tend to stay longer and spend more. Construction and road closures are also causing traffic congestion, leading to some tourists expressing reluctance to return. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience, expecting a positive response to the changing economic landscape.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, now advising parents to consult with a doctor about whether their children should receive the shots, and removing the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., contradicting advice from medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics. Public health experts have raised concerns about the process behind the decision, which bypassed the usual transparent discussions. This change could make it harder for parents to get their children vaccinated, and some insurance companies may no longer cover the costs.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. This decision aims to boost the local steel industry, decrease reliance on China, and ensure the survival of U.S. Steel. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue. Trump also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing concerns over the lack of knighthoods or damehoods awarded to players in the sport's 130-year history. Officials and supporters believe their players have been "poorly treated" by the honors system, leading to accusations of snobbery and class prejudice. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has added his voice, noting that other sports, including rugby union, have received such honors regularly. The leader of a cross-party group of MPs suggests the lack of recognition is due to the working-class backgrounds of rugby league stars.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests a link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing rates of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author argues that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has led to nearly impossible standards for parenting. This has resulted in adult children cutting off contact with parents and a heightened fear of not meeting these standards. The author proposes that this fear contributes to the dread many in her generation feel about parenthood.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer a set of historic photos believed to be among the earliest depicting enslaved people in the United States to the International African American Museum in South Carolina. The agreement ends a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who argues she is a descendant of two people in the photos. The images, taken in 1850, were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz as part of research to prove the superiority of white people. The case has fueled debate about how universities should respond to their historic links to slavery.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer, with results showing it doubled the length of time patients were cancer-free. The drug is given before and after surgery to prime the body's defenses against cancer recurrence. This breakthrough offers hope for patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer, where there has been little change in treatment options for two decades. The study showed that after three years, patients given pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body.</p>
