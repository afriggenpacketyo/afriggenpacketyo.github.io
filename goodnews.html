          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to advance a deal allowing TikTok's U.S. operations to be primarily owned by American investors, thereby averting a national security ban. This agreement stipulates that ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, will retain less than 20% ownership, with a consortium including Oracle taking majority control. Oracle is designated to host U.S. user data and meticulously review the app's code and algorithm to ensure robust security and prevent foreign influence. This complex solution aims to protect American data and maintain the popular platform's availability for its 170 million U.S. users, addressing long-standing concerns from lawmakers about potential Chinese government access.</p>

          <p>911 emergency systems in Mississippi have been fully restored, Governor Tate Reeves announced, following a widespread outage caused by damage to AT&T's fiber optic lines earlier on Thursday. Meanwhile, emergency services in various parts of Louisiana, including populous cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans, were still undergoing restoration efforts, though some parishes reported successful recovery. Officials confirmed the incident stemmed from an accidental fiber cut, ruling out any malicious intent, and urged residents in impacted regions to utilize alternative local emergency contact numbers posted by law enforcement. This significant disruption underscored the vulnerability of essential communication infrastructure and the critical need for resilient systems in both states.</p>

          <p>Actor Mark Wahlberg candidly revealed that the most significant sacrifice in his extensive Hollywood career is the considerable time he must spend away from his family. He highlighted the joy of having his children visit him during filming and attend movie premieres, even as their enthusiasm for his action roles has lessened with age. Wahlberg underscored his unwavering commitment to discipline, particularly his rigorous early morning fitness regimen, as fundamental to achieving both personal well-being and professional accomplishments. He openly attributes much of his life's stability and success to his wife, Rhea Durham, whom he considers instrumental in shaping the man he is today and creating a beautiful family life.</p>

          <p>The article encourages Los Angeles Dodgers fans to truly appreciate their team's remarkable and sustained success, especially after clinching their 12th National League West title in 13 seasons and securing another postseason berth. Former Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen underscored the immense difficulty of consistently reaching the playoffs, drawing a stark contrast with the Angels' lengthy drought and his own experience outside of postseason play. Despite the Dodgers' golden era, fan expectations remain exceptionally high, with only a World Series championship deemed sufficient. This intense pressure often transforms gratitude into anxiety once the playoffs commence, emphasizing the transient nature of celebrating regular season triumphs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco exceeded Wall Street's expectations for its quarterly earnings and revenue, propelled by robust double-digit gains in both membership income and its e-commerce sector. The warehouse retailer continues to attract a growing number of members, particularly younger consumers actively seeking value, with nearly half of its new sign-ups annually coming from individuals under 40. Despite a modest dip in shares following the announcement, the company reported a significant 14% increase in membership fees, reflecting both new sign-ups and a recent fee hike, and announced plans to open 35 new warehouses in the upcoming fiscal year. While overall inflation remained low, non-food merchandise saw a return of price increases, largely due to imported goods.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers officially clinched their 12th National League West title in 13 seasons with a decisive 8-0 victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. This achievement comes despite a regular season that, relative to high preseason expectations, was somewhat disappointing due to starting pitching injuries, bullpen issues, and an offensive slump. However, the team now enters the postseason with significant momentum, having won 12 of their last 17 games. Manager Dave Roberts highlighted the squad's unwavering connection and competitive spirit through adversity, expressing a strong belief that their combined talent and fight will prove crucial in October. This victory ensures they will host the upcoming best-of-three wild-card round.</p>

          <p>As China prepares to draft its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint for its policy trajectory, analysts anticipate a strong focus on fortifying the nation's manufacturing ecosystem and addressing existing weak links within its supply chains, especially in high-tech sectors. The article underscores China's already unrivalled and resilient manufacturing base, noting how even products assembled elsewhere, like "made-in-India" iPhones, still depend significantly on Chinese components. However, the upcoming plan will likely prioritize moving further up the value chain and resolving critical "chokepoints" in advanced technology. This strategic initiative reflects Beijing's commitment to enhancing domestic economic transformation, bolstering self-sufficiency, and navigating heightened external uncertainties to maintain global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, has sharply criticized Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's recently proposed economic policies, explicitly comparing them to the "disaster" of former Prime Minister Liz Truss's short-lived tenure. Burnham, whose interviews have fueled speculation about a potential leadership challenge against Starmer, advocated for a 50p top rate of income tax alongside tax cuts for lower earners. Starmer firmly reiterated the government's commitment to fiscal rules as the cornerstone of economic stability, cautioning that abandoning them for increased spending, similar to Truss's approach with tax cuts, would inevitably prove catastrophic for working people. This public political exchange underscores simmering internal Labour Party tensions and ongoing national economic anxieties ahead of an anticipated November budget and local elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to Anthropic's substantial $1.5 billion settlement offer in a class action lawsuit initiated by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson. The lawsuit contended that Anthropic, an AI startup valued at $183 billion and recognized for its Claude AI assistant, unlawfully utilized books from pirated databases like Library Genesis to train its artificial intelligence models. This landmark settlement, which is set to become the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, includes compensation of approximately $3,000 per book plus interest, and mandates that Anthropic destroy the datasets containing the allegedly pirated material. The court's decision establishes a significant precedent for addressing copyright infringement within the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to unveil plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital ID scheme in an upcoming speech, aiming to significantly crack down on illegal working and modernize various state services. The practical implementation details of this scheme, including how it will accommodate individuals without smartphones or passports, are slated for a comprehensive consultation. This initiative marks a revival of a concept previously blocked by a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, though Starmer believes public attitudes have shifted. However, critics, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK, have swiftly denounced the plan as a "desperate gimmick" and an "affront to civil liberties," questioning both its efficacy in addressing illegal immigration and its potential infringement on the freedoms of law-abiding citizens.</p>

While JLR's factories are slated to remain closed until next month at the earliest, the global parts logistics center is progressively returning to full operations, and the financial system for wholesale vehicle transactions has been restored.

While Amazon did not admit wrongdoing, the agreement mandates that the company cease misrepresenting Prime terms, provide clear disclosures during enrollment, and establish an easy cancellation process. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson lauded the penalty as a "monumental win" for consumers, although Amazon still confronts a larger antitrust lawsuit from the FTC.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have experienced a surprising and robust boost heading into the fourth quarter, leading Cox Automotive to revise its 2025 sales forecast upwards to 16.1 million vehicles. This unexpected resilient demand is primarily attributed to consumers accelerating their purchases, driven by fears of future tariffs and anticipated price increases. Specifically, President Trump's tariff announcements earlier in the year and the impending expiration of up to $7,500 federal tax credits for electric vehicles at the end of this month have spurred buyers. While this pull-ahead in sales has temporarily benefited the automotive industry, analysts anticipate a slowdown in the fourth quarter and into next year as these influencing factors diminish. Larger automakers like GM, Toyota, and Hyundai have notably gained market share, while smaller brands have faced challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Jillian Lauren, who is married to Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, has been granted mental health diversion, allowing her to avoid jail time after an incident where she shot at Los Angeles police officers. The officers had entered her backyard while pursuing unrelated suspects, and Lauren, armed with a handgun, ignored commands before opening fire. She was wounded when officers returned fire. Under the terms of the agreement, Lauren must refrain from owning firearms, avoid drugs and alcohol, and attend therapy for two years, after which all charges will be dismissed. Prosecutors did not oppose the diversion, and the incident highlighted questions about whether Lauren heard police commands amidst a hovering helicopter. This legal outcome underscores the justice system's consideration of mental health factors.</p>
