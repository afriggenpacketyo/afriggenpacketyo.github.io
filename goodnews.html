          <p>After rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 storm, Hurricane Erin has slightly weakened to a Category 4 hurricane over the Atlantic. The storm's center is forecast to pass north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, remaining offshore and avoiding a direct impact on the islands. However, tropical storm watches are in effect for several areas, with officials warning of heavy rain, potential flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions. Current forecast models show the hurricane curving northward and staying well away from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has undergone a massive five-year renovation to become a luxury party destination. Purchased in 2017 for £555,000 by a former software CEO, the historic fort had been abandoned for 17 years and lacked basic utilities. After a challenging and costly restoration, the island now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million. The owner hopes its unique, isolated location will appeal to someone looking to host exclusive events.</p>

          <p>A group of students about to receive their GCSE results opened letters they wrote to themselves as 11-year-olds at the start of their secondary education in 2021. The letters, written just after a major COVID-19 lockdown, capture their fears about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. Reading their past thoughts on face masks, friendships, and future girlfriends, the students reflected on how their entire secondary school experience was shaped by the disruption. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their resilience and the unique challenges their generation faced during a formative period.</p>

The referee stopped the contest after Whyte rose to his feet but was deemed unfit to continue. This decisive victory extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13 wins and strengthens his position as a future contender for a heavyweight title.</p>

          <p>A new music collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" focuses on the final burst of creativity from Elvis Presley between 1972 and 1975, a period marked by personal turmoil and professional disappointment. The recordings, made in Los Angeles, include his last major hit "Burning Love" and soulful ballads reflecting his divorce. A longtime friend recounts how Presley's hopes were dashed after losing a potential role in the film "A Star Is Born," a setback that may have contributed to his subsequent decline. The box set offers a poignant look at the King of Rock and Roll's artistry before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Samsung has increased its share of the U.S. smartphone market, narrowing the gap with Apple, largely due to the growing momentum of its innovative foldable phones. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share rose to 31% while Apple's declined to 49%, signaling a renewed competition between the two tech giants. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget models to premium foldables like the Z Fold 7, is proving effective. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond by launching its own foldable iPhone to compete in this emerging category. (not investment advice)</p>
