          <h2>US Mortgage Rates Remain High Amid Market Volatility</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average U.S. mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed loan remains steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels, influenced by factors such as Treasury bond demand and Federal Reserve policies. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror the volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for pricing home loans. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes have declined, reflecting the impact of these economic pressures on the housing market.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, attributed to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. The company's net income reached $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow and operating activities also saw declines. These figures indicate ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant amid slowing global demand and trade concerns. Aramco announced a slashed performance-linked dividend payout while increasing its first-quarter base dividend, reflecting its efforts to balance shareholder returns with financial realities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States and China made "great progress" in high-level trade talks held in Switzerland. The discussions, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, aimed to de-escalate tariff tensions between the two countries. Trump suggested that Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally and that Beijing would need to make its own concessions. The article notes that Chinese exporters are struggling with the US's tariffs, while the US economy has contracted, increasing pressure to reach a deal.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa toward renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends, as China committed to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021, and is fueled by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing the capabilities of human controllers. The new algorithm allows drones to execute high-risk maneuvers with precision, potentially revolutionizing flight operations. Gao Fei, an associate professor at Zhejiang University, noted that transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards' is key to redefining traditional drone flight paradigms.</p>
