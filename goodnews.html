          <p>Texas lawmakers are progressing with legislation aimed at preventing entities associated with countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in the state. Republican state Representative Cole Hefner emphasizes that Senate Bill 17 targets actions and affiliations, not race or nationality, focusing on land purchases posing national security risks. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and block land deals, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful residents. Hefner hopes this legislation will inspire a nationwide effort to secure the homeland, addressing concerns about foreign espionage and influence.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives and lower labor costs, causing concern among US lawmakers. The UK's Film Tax Relief offers a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films like "Jurassic World: Dominion," which saved Universal an estimated ¬£89.1 million. While some US politicians propose federal tax incentives to compete, others worry about the optics of supporting "woke Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not be running for the Georgia Senate race in the upcoming year, citing her unwillingness to fight for a Republican team she believes is not focused on winning. This decision follows Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's choice not to contend for the Senate seat, which has opened the field for other Republican candidates. Greene's decision comes despite the seat's importance to both parties' Senate ambitions, as Republicans seek to oust Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff and expand their majority.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, despite being too young for the upcoming Winter Olympics, has gained attention for mastering two quadruple jumps at just 15 years old. Compared to junior champion Rio Nakata, Nishino successfully landed a quad toe loop in a competition and has previously executed a quad salchow. Coach Misao Sato notes Nishino's rapid physical growth, requiring quick adjustments to bigger boots and blades. Nishino aims to achieve strong results at the World Junior Championships and Junior Grand Prix Final in the next season.</p>

The agreement settles several claims Texas made against Google in 2022 related to geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data, with Paxton arguing Google unlawfully tracked and collected users' private data. Google spokesperson Jos√© Casta√±eda stated the agreement settles an array of "old claims," some of which relate to product policies the company has already changed.

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over allegations surrounding their film "It Ends with Us," according to a Swift spokesperson. The spokesperson states that the subpoena appears to be a tactic to draw public attention rather than focus on the case's facts. Lively sued Baldoni in December, alleging sexual harassment on set, which Baldoni denies, countersuing Lively for defamation. Swift's connection to the film was limited to permitting the use of her song "My Tears Ricochet.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled potential openness to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff rate ahead of trade talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The conciliatory tone comes amid a tense trade standoff since Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports. Analysts suggest that a reduction below 80% could positively impact markets, with UBS Global Wealth Management anticipating tariffs settling around 34%. Trump also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, raising hopes for further agreements.</p>

Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be harmful to humans. Public health officials warn that the emergence of biotoxins is unpredictable, and cooking the shellfish does not reliably get rid of the toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to regular testing.</p>
