          <p>Shares of Trilogy Metals, a Canadian minerals explorer, skyrocketed after the White House announced a $35.6 million investment, giving the U.S. government a 10% stake in the company. This partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's decision to block the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed focus on national resource security amid concerns over China's dominance in the global critical minerals market. Environmental groups have opposed the project, citing potential harm to local ecosystems and communities. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the S&P 500 continues to set record highs, some financial advisors are cautioning investors against over-reliance on the index for diversification. They point out that the market capitalization-weighted index is heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, which could increase volatility and risk during a market pullback. To mitigate this, experts suggest alternatives such as total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. The advice emphasizes the importance of building a balanced portfolio to weather potential downturns, rather than assuming the S&P 500 alone provides sufficient safety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Surge in Alternative Capital Allows Startups to Delay Public Offerings for Longer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:14:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology startups are remaining private for significantly longer periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely fueled by the massive growth of alternative capital sources, such as venture capital, private equity, and sovereign wealth funds, which provide ample funding without the regulatory burdens of being a public company. As a result, companies are more mature and have much larger revenues by the time they enter the public market. While this allows early-stage growth to occur in private hands, some analysts question whether the flood of capital into private markets will continue to generate the high returns seen in the past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents across the United Kingdom have reported an unusual number of ladybugs swarming in and around their homes, a phenomenon attributed to recent warm weather. After a cool start to autumn, a spell of sunny, mild conditions has prompted the insects to become more active as they seek warm, sheltered places to hibernate for the winter. Experts explain that this behavior is normal for this time of year, particularly for the invasive harlequin ladybug, which often finds its way indoors through small gaps. The surge in the ladybug population is also linked to a very warm spring and summer, which led to an abundance of aphids, their primary food source.</p>

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised technology, but the announcement was overshadowed by anticipation for a more significant reveal teased by the company. Social media posts from Tesla hinted at a major announcement, sparking widespread speculation that it could be the long-awaited lower-cost model, the next-generation Roadster, or another new product. The company has not released a new model since the Cybertruck in 2023 and has been facing a slump in auto sales due to an aging lineup and increased competition. The event is seen as a pivotal moment for Tesla to shift focus back to its automotive innovations and future growth.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Payments to Continue During Shutdown, but Administrative Services May Be Disrupted</h2>

          <p>The 74 million Americans who receive Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks during the government shutdown, as the program is covered by mandatory spending and not subject to annual appropriations. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget does require congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt key customer services. The agency's contingency plan indicates that while benefit payments will proceed, services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards will be halted. A prolonged shutdown could also delay the annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), as it depends on inflation data from the shuttered Labor Department.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Suggest Focusing on Effective Tax Rate When Choosing Between Pretax and Roth 401(k)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between traditional (pretax) and Roth (after-tax) 401(k) contributions, financial experts advise looking beyond your current marginal tax rate. A more insightful approach is to compare your current marginal tax rate with your potential *effective* tax rate in retirement. Because of progressive tax brackets and deductions, your effective tax rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of total income—is often much lower than your top marginal rate. Therefore, making pretax contributions during high-earning years could be more advantageous if your overall effective tax rate during retirement is expected to be significantly lower, allowing you to pay taxes when the rate is lowest.

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock price climb after the company increased its long-term financial outlook during a meeting with analysts. The computer maker now anticipates annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, a significant jump from its previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Dell attributed the optimistic revision to the "unprecedented pace of change in technology," particularly the surging customer demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, including the servers, storage, and networking equipment it provides. The company, a key customer of Nvidia, is positioning itself as a leader in AI solutions and expects to ship $20 billion in AI servers in its 2026 fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

As the mayor of Foumban and leader of the Democratic Union for Cameroon party, Ndam Njoya is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice. Progress." and aims to address the country's long-running Anglophone crisis. Unusually, she has garnered endorsements from a dozen former presidential candidates who are urging the divided opposition to unite behind her.

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years. While the overall number of homes sold has decreased amid a weaker market, the share bought by investors has grown, highlighting their role in providing liquidity. The vast majority of these buyers are small investors owning ten or fewer properties, while large institutional investors have actually been selling more homes than they buy for six consecutive quarters. Investors continue to focus on lower-priced homes, paying an average of $455,481, well below the national average, and are most active in populous states like Texas, California, and Florida.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:11:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of buildings, from hospitals to data centers, are installing thermal energy storage systems, also known as "ice batteries," to provide sustainable air conditioning. This technology freezes large tanks of water at night when electricity is cheaper and demand on the grid is low. During the day, the melting ice is used to chill water that circulates through the building, providing cooling without drawing significant power during peak hours. This load-shifting approach reduces planet-warming emissions, lowers electricity costs, and eases strain on the power grid, offering a viable solution to meet rising cooling demands driven by climate change.</p>
