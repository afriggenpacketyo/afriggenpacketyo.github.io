        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jockey Junior Alvarado, who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules by striking the colt eight times with his riding crop, exceeding the permitted six times. The Kentucky Board of Stewards issued the ruling, noting this was Alvarado's second violation in 180 days, leading to a doubled fine under HISA's escalating penalty structure. All jockey crop fines go towards a jockey mental health program, according to HISA. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin and trained by William Mott, will skip the Preakness Stakes but is expected to run in the Belmont Stakes. Relevant context: The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority is a nationwide organization that regulates the sport.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese delegations concluded the first day of sensitive tariff talks in Switzerland, with discussions set to resume Sunday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in over 10 hours of negotiations aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. While there was no immediate indication of progress, both sides are hoping to scale back tariffs that have disrupted global markets and trade. President Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after being convicted of defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth offered the victim fraudulent investment opportunities promising high returns and no risk, ultimately depleting her legitimate investments and causing her to take out a reverse mortgage. Prosecutors revealed that Cohen-Roth was operating a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and fund a lavish lifestyle. The judge cited Cohen-Roth's age as a factor in the reduced sentence.</p>
