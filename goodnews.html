          <p>CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo has publicly shared her 10-month private battle with early-stage breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Her diagnosis, a lobular tumor, was caught at Stage One due to her persistence in requesting an examination of her right breast during a routine ultrasound, after a self-check revealed a lump. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and 15 days of radiation, and is now in remission, taking medication for five years. She hopes her story encourages others to perform self-checks and seek timely screenings, with the article highlighting local initiatives offering free mammograms in South Florida.</p>

          <p>South African Olympian Caster Semenya has ended a seven-year legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules, which barred her from women's track and field due to differences in sex development (DSD) and naturally high testosterone levels. Semenya's attorney stated the challenge reached the highest court with a "highly successful outcome," though the specific implications for her athletic career remain unclear. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about fairness, inclusion, and the biological advantages of DSD athletes in women's sports, with World Athletics prioritizing the female category's integrity. This decision marks a significant moment in a long-standing and complex dispute.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the FICO score, saw its stock surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to license credit scores directly, bypassing credit bureaus. This move aims to eliminate "unnecessary mark-ups" on FICO scores, giving lenders more choice and potentially improving Fair Isaac's economics. Shares of credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax declined in response. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director praised the initiative as a "Creative Solution" to foster safer, stronger, and more competitive markets for consumers, signaling a positive shift in the industry.</p>

          <p>Following a terror attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur that killed two Jewish individuals, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to do "everything" to protect Jewish communities and defeat antisemitic hate. He promised a more visible police presence and emphasized national unity against division, cutting short a political summit to address the tragedy. The attack, which also left three injured, prompted widespread condemnation from national and international leaders, including King Charles III and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Community leaders echoed calls for solidarity and immediate action against rising antisemitism across the country.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has successfully concluded a secondary share sale worth $6.6 billion, allowing current and former employees to sell stock at an impressive $500 billion valuation. This transaction, involving investors like Thrive Capital and SoftBank, cements OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. The lower-than-authorized participation in the sale is seen internally as a vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects. This strategic move helps retain talent and reward employees without pursuing an immediate IPO, amidst intense competition for AI researchers and market dominance.</p>

The film, "Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," captures his last three years, including his battle with Parkinson's and spinal injuries. Osbourne expressed frustration at having to perform seated but cherished the opportunity to say goodbye to fans. The documentary also reveals his desire to be buried in the UK and his unique "addiction" to Pink Lady apples, as detailed in his posthumously published memoir.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal and YouTube TV have successfully reached a new distribution agreement, preventing a potential blackout of NBCU channels for millions of customers. The deal ensures carriage for NBC, CNBC, Telemundo, and will launch a new NBC Sports Network, making Universal movies and TV shows available on-demand. This resolution follows tense negotiations where YouTube TV backed away from demands to integrate Peacock content at no extra cost, instead agreeing to offer Peacock as a subscription through YouTube Primetime Channels. Both companies expressed satisfaction, highlighting their commitment to delivering content across platforms and avoiding subscriber disruption.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock has surged over 50% in the last month, increasing the value of the U.S. government's 10% stake in the chipmaker to approximately $16 billion. The Trump administration's $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock was funded by grants from former President Joe Biden's CHIPS and Science Act. This impressive rebound follows Intel's difficult fiscal 2024 and CEO Pat Gelsinger's exit, with renewed confidence under current leadership and new investments from companies like Nvidia. The surge underscores a focus on U.S. chip manufacturing for economic and national security, reflecting significant market recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

These sanguine remarks come as the world's two largest economies continue their concerted efforts to de-escalate trade tensions, with an extended ceasefire on tariffs currently set to last until November.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are finding that a $90,000 home equity loan is now less expensive than in recent history, thanks to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. Typical monthly payments for a 10-year loan at 8.34% are around $1,108, and for a 15-year loan at 8.21%, about $871. While rates have decreased, they haven't fallen dramatically, prompting borrowers to also consider Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer rates comfortably under 8%. Homeowners should carefully weigh their options, considering future rate movements and the significant risks associated with using their home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>
