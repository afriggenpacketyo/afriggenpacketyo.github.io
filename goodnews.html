          <p>Sampdoria avoided relegation in Serie B after being awarded a 3-0 victory over Salernitana following the abandonment of their second-leg relegation playoff due to fan violence. The game was halted in the 65th minute with Sampdoria leading 2-0 after Salernitana fans threw smoke bombs and seats onto the pitch. Serie B's sports judge awarded Sampdoria the victory, securing a 5-0 aggregate win and guaranteeing their escape from relegation. Salernitana has been relegated for the second consecutive year, and the club must play two matches behind closed doors next season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Journalist Carter Sherman's new book, *The Second Coming: Sex and the Next Generation's Fight Over its Future*, examines how norms around sex are shifting for Gen Z. Sherman argues that Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations due to factors like the rise of the internet, social media, porn, the Me Too movement, and the pandemic. She notes that many young people feel negatively impacted by porn and that the Me Too movement, while raising awareness, has not led to mass institutional change. The book emphasizes the need for comprehensive sex education that addresses consent and sexual health, rather than abstinence-only approaches.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting if inflation remains subdued. Bowman suggested that President Trump's tariffs are likely to have a limited impact on prices, potentially paving the way for lower rates. Her comments align with those of Governor Christopher Waller, who also suggested a possible rate cut in July. Bowman supported the shift in the post-meeting statement, noting diminished policy uncertainty and a focus on potential labor market weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

Hochul cited the need for energy independence and supply chain security as key drivers for the initiative.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparison of CD interest rates versus traditional savings accounts reveals that CDs currently offer significantly higher returns. A $10,000 deposit in a 6-month CD at 4.49% earns $222.04, while a traditional savings account at 0.38% earns only $18.98. Similar disparities exist for longer terms, making CDs a more attractive option for maximizing savings. It is important to consider personal financial needs before making a decision, such as whether one will need to withdraw funds before the CD matures. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay off medical debt or credit card debt first requires considering factors beyond interest rates. Credit card debt can damage credit scores more quickly due to monthly reporting and high utilization ratios. Credit card debt also compounds faster with higher interest rates and stricter payment terms. Medical debt has a longer grace period before impacting credit and offers more flexible payment options, but it is important to understand one's own personal needs before making a decision.
