          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, argue against Republican lawmakers' proposal to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They emphasize the destruction caused by unchecked power, collusion, and manipulated financial statements, recalling the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, which led to significant job losses and market destabilization. The authors underscore the importance of the P.C.A.O.B. as an independent regulator ensuring audit quality and preventing conflicts of interest, noting its bipartisan support since its creation in 2002. They caution that eliminating the board would increase the risk of corporate disasters and shift costs to the public, urging Congress to maintain this vital safeguard. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iranian truck drivers have expanded their labor stoppage to over 100 towns and cities, prompting a violent crackdown by the clerical regime. Experts are urging the U.S. government to support the truckers with strike pay and other aid to promote human rights and potentially cause regime change from within. The core issues driving the strike, which began on May 18, include working conditions, reduced insurance coverage, lack of roadside assistance, graft in cargo allocation, and expensive spare parts. The U.S. is currently engaged in talks with Iran‚Äôs regime to dismantle its illegal nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are finding a workaround to minimize the impact of tariffs by using a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to use the price of the first sale in a number of transactions to calculate customs duties, potentially saving significant costs. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales, the sales must be at arm's length, there must be proof the item was destined for the U.S., and there must be documentation of the first sale price. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention under the Trump administration's tariff regime.</p>

          <p>A European-wide shift to nuclear power appears to be gaining momentum as countries hedge their bets in pursuit of more energy independence. Denmark announced plans to reconsider a 40-year ban on nuclear power, Spain signaled an openness to review a shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany dropped its long-held opposition to atomic power. The renewed interest in nuclear is driven by some of the costs associated with renewables. Denmark plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has stated his party's intention to make it easier for people to have children by supporting more generous tax breaks for married people and scrapping the two-child benefit limit. Farage emphasized that lifting the cap is aimed at helping lower-paid workers, not supporting a "benefits culture." He also announced plans to reverse government cuts that withdrew the winter fuel payment from 10 million pensioners.

After multiple tests, Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected pericardial constriction, which was confirmed through open-heart surgery performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi.

However, the IMF has warned that the Chancellor must stick to her rules on tax and spending to maintain economic stability. The IMF cautioned that global trade tensions, volatile financial market conditions, and the challenge of containing day-to-day spending mean the Chancellor will face difficult choices to balance taxation with spending in the long term.
