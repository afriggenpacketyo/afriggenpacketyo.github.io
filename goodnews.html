          <p>China has successfully completed a 1,856-kilometer green belt aimed at containing the expansion of three major deserts in its Inner Mongolia region. The project, part of the country's 'green great wall' initiative, connects the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. Engineers utilized a method involving straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This large-scale ecological project is designed to build an effective sand prevention system and strengthen the region's environmental defenses against desertification.</p>

          <p>In a display of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their bilateral trade flows. This move comes after President Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on any country participating in the BRICS economic bloc, which he claimed was designed to undermine the U.S. dollar. The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and other emerging economies, aims to reform Western-dominated international institutions. Trump's increasingly aggressive stance against the bloc has prompted member nations to strengthen their economic ties with one another.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is strategically positioned to become a new hub for global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The author points to the dismantling of USAID as an independent agency and the White House's "America first" mentality as evidence of a U.S. retreat from soft power. In contrast, China is proactively engaging with the Global South, exemplified by the recent launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong. This shift creates an opportunity for the city to leverage its cosmopolitan status and fill the void left by the U.S.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother, Mandonna Kashanian, who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention following an intervention by Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that uses fraudulent IT workers to generate revenue for the regime. The scheme involves North Korean operatives posing as American remote workers to get hired by companies, with their earnings funneled back to fund Kim Jong Un's weapons programs. Song is accused of recruiting operatives and stealing U.S. citizens' personal information to create fake identities for the workers. The sanctions also target a Russia-based network involved in a similar plot.</p>
