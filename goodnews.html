          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of plotting a military coup. The court ruled that he led a conspiracy to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict, which also bars him from public office until 2033, was delivered by a 4-1 vote from the panel of justices. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, has called the trial a "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>A child and baby nutritionist has provided practical advice for parents dealing with fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children. The expert suggests five key strategies to make mealtimes less stressful, including allowing children autonomy to choose what they eat and not labeling foods as "good" or "bad." Other tips include prioritizing enjoyment at the dinner table, being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite, and involving them in food preparation to foster familiarity and acceptance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is a response to a difficult period in his life, aiming to create a joyful and culturally exploratory record. The album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern musical influences, featuring instruments like the sitar and collaborations with Indian superstar Arijit Singh. However, the review notes that while these additions are well-executed, they are often assimilated into Sheeran's familiar brand of mainstream pop. The article suggests the album is an enjoyable, if safe, effort that plays to his strengths without taking significant creative risks.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service is looking to Denmark as a model for improving cancer care, after the Scandinavian country dramatically increased its survival rates over the past 25 years. Denmark's strategy involved significant, long-term investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, establishing rapid treatment targets, and a political consensus to prioritize cancer care. This approach transformed Denmark from a low performer to a leader in cancer outcomes, suggesting that a similar focus on investment and accountability could benefit the NHS.</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that men now have the right to take their wives' last names upon marriage. The Constitutional Court found the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their names, to be discriminatory on the basis of gender. The ruling noted that the practice of women taking their husband's surname was a "colonial import," as many African cultures traditionally saw women retain their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the law accordingly.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's $12 trillion stock market are creating a challenge for regulators as Beijing attempts to foster a stable, sustainable bull market. The government's goal is to position equities as a reliable source of household wealth to help boost consumer spending and shift assets away from the property market. After a recent pullback slightly moderated the rapid ascent, analysts believe the market is transitioning to a "slow bull" phase, which may involve increased volatility but maintains a positive long-term trend.

He suggested that despite a "fraught backdrop" of national debt and geopolitical tensions, individual stocks can still succeed and many currently appear undervalued. Cramer contended that softer economic data, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, is fueling the rally and that bearish money managers will need to become buyers to avoid underperforming.

This resilience has characterized his career rise from the French second division to the Premier League and now the Champions League.
