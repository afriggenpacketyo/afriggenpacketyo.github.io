          <p>Five fishermen, including three Peruvians and two Colombians, arrived in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna boat, having spent 55 days adrift at sea after their boat's alternator was damaged. The Ecuadorian navy coordinated with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. This rescue follows a similar incident earlier in the year when another Peruvian fisherman was rescued after 95 days at sea, highlighting the dangers faced by those working in the fishing industry and the importance of international cooperation in rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese delegations met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs in an attempt to de-escalate trade tensions that threaten the global economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in prolonged negotiations aimed at scaling back the massive tariffs both countries have imposed on each other's goods. President Trump suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have pushed for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.
