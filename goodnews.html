          <p>With Japan's aging population and a rise in childless couples, more seniors are turning to bequest donations to hospitals and nonprofits. Yoko Inaba, a 71-year-old, is one such individual who has decided to donate her savings to a medical facility for newborns, finding relief in knowing how her money will be used after her death. Readyfor Inc. mediates between donors and recipients, seeing an increase in demand for their services, especially for donations to child care, health care, and educational institutions. The Supreme Court reports a threefold increase in money going into the national treasury due to the absence of inheritors, highlighting the growing need for bequest donation services.</p>

          <p>China's largest banks have slashed one-year deposit rates below 1%, prompting savers to seek alternative investment options. This move, the seventh adjustment since September 2022, has left millions of Chinese families grappling with economic uncertainty and a lack of attractive investment choices. Client managers at banks report a surge in inquiries as people lament the end of relying on bank deposits for steady returns. The decline in deposit yields exacerbates the already challenging financial landscape for households facing weak income prospects.</p>

          <p>The finance chiefs of the Group of Seven democracies showcased unity in addressing global challenges, from economic imbalances to the future of Ukraine, despite trade tensions stemming from U.S. tariffs. While avoiding direct mention of Trump's tariffs, the G7 agreed to leverage their economic relationships to tackle issues like excessive imbalances. Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda expressed concerns about the potential effects of Trump's tariffs and the economic uncertainty they create. The finance ministers also discussed China's industrial overcapacity and nonmarket practices, emphasizing the importance of a level playing field.</p>

They are focused on creating the sound of the future, drawing inspiration from their past while exploring new musical territories. Bono emphasizes the band's desire to push boundaries and make something original in a musical landscape where bass, drums, guitar, and a loudmouth singer sound like an original idea.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass‚Äô public safety initiatives to avoid laying off 1,000 city workers. The budget cuts funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than since 1995, and reduces new hires for the Fire Department. The council restored positions at the Department of Cultural Affairs and provided funding for the Climate Emergency Mobilization Office. The budget aims to balance the city's financial crisis while prioritizing essential services and minimizing layoffs.</p>
