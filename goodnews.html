          <p>LeBron James will make NBA history by playing a 23rd season, after exercising his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season. This move surpasses his tie with Vince Carter for the most seasons played and marks his eighth year with the team. At 40, James is also approaching Robert Parish's record for the most regular-season games played. The decision resolves a key offseason question for the Lakers, who are now focusing on building their roster, particularly seeking a new center.</p>

Despite its strong start, the film, which had a reported budget over $200 million, will need sustained ticket sales to become profitable.

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the modern conservative movement. The book argues that Buckley, through his magazine National Review and his television presence, invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party. It traces a direct line from Buckley's intellectual groundwork to figures like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and ultimately Donald Trump. The biography explores how Buckley's coalition-building and anti-establishment critiques paved the way for the current political landscape.</p>
