          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as Thailand's new prime minister, ending the long-standing dominance of the Shinawatra political dynasty. His ascent follows the court-ordered dismissal of his predecessor, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, for breaching ministerial ethics. Anutin, who previously served as health minister and is known for championing cannabis decriminalization, secured parliamentary support from the main opposition party to form a new coalition government. He has pledged to work with honesty for the benefit of the country.</p>

          <p>Two years after a devastating season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his New York Jets career, quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The opening game is scheduled against the Jets, the team that recently released him, creating a highly anticipated and dramatic matchup. The article reflects on the immense hype surrounding his move to New York and the subsequent disappointment of his brief, injury-plagued tenure. Rodgers' return to the same stadium marks a pivotal moment for both him and the franchises.</p>

          <p>The US Open tennis tournament has evolved from a traditional sporting event into a major cultural and commercial festival, prioritizing spectacle and consumption over the sport itself. The experience is now characterized by high-priced concessions like $23 cocktails, celebrity appearances managed for social media engagement, and pervasive influencer marketing, drawing comparisons to festivals like Coachella. While this strategy has boosted attendance and revenue to record highs, this article suggests it has altered the fundamental character of the Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected animal rights extremist on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. He is the prime suspect in two bombings that occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003. After a dramatic escape from FBI surveillance, he vanished until he was discovered last year living under an alias in a secluded cottage in Wales. His capture ends a two-decade international manhunt for the first American-born individual on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.</p>

          <p>Approximately 60,000 runners are participating in the 44th Great North Run, one of the world's largest and most celebrated half marathons. The iconic 13.1-mile course begins in Newcastle, crosses into Gateshead, and finishes on the coast in South Shields, attracting hundreds of thousands of supportive spectators. The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, highlighted its enduring and growing popularity, noting an increase in participation from younger runners and women, who now represent nearly half of all entrants.</p>

          <h2>Total Lunar Eclipse to Create 'Blood Moon' Visible Across the UK</h2>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across much of the United Kingdom, causing the full moon to adopt a reddish hue in a phenomenon popularly known as a "Blood Moon." This celestial event occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow onto the lunar surface. The distinctive red color is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, a process called Rayleigh scattering, which is the same effect that produces colorful sunrises and sunsets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of US and Chinese scientists has pioneered a new method for launching miniature robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The technique, known as cavitation, uses a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material on a wet surface, causing surrounding water droplets to boil and form bubbles. The subsequent violent collapse of these bubbles creates a powerful force, capable of propelling millimeter-scale jumpers high into the air, offering a novel mechanism for micro-robotics.</p>

Her triumph in New York was distinguished by a mature and emotionally controlled performance, allowing her to overcome the high-stakes pressure that had challenged her in previous major finals.</p>
