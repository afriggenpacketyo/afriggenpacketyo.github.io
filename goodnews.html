          <p>Elon Musk announced that Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with intentions to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco thereafter. The service will initially begin with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the upcoming FSD Unsupervised software. This rollout follows Musk's prior promises of fully self-driving cars, though Tesla currently lacks vehicles safe for unsupervised use. Musk emphasized a cautious approach, starting small to ensure safety and success before scaling up the operation significantly, marking a step towards autonomous transportation.</p>

          <p>With market volatility and economic uncertainty impacting retirement savings, seniors should evaluate their long-term care insurance needs.

          <p>A team of neurology experts has proposed a new method for evaluating patients with traumatic brain injuries, aiming to improve assessments and prognoses. The current Glasgow Coma Scale is deemed insufficient, leading to inadequate care for some patients. The new system incorporates additional factors such as post-traumatic amnesia, sensitivity to light and noise, blood biomarkers, and brain scans. It also considers the patient's social environment, with the goal of facilitating better research, drug treatments, and procedures, and improving patient outcomes by providing more accurate classifications of injuries.</p>

          <h2>Senate Advances GENIUS Act, a Cryptocurrency Regulation Bill</h2>

          <p>The Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset. The bill establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, including a mandate to hold a reserve of assets underlying the cryptocurrency and prioritize repayment in the event of bankruptcy. Supporters hail the bill as a means of protecting consumers and setting industry standards, while critics warn that it fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns and risks endangering consumers and the wider economy with a weak set of rules.</p>
