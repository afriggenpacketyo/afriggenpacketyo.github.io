          <p>During a post-match interview at Wimbledon, American tennis player Ben Shelton made a public plea for his sister to get more time off from her job at Morgan Stanley. He credited his sister, Emma, as his "lucky charm" for his successful run in the tournament and asked for help in convincing her employer to let her stay. The heartwarming request was successful, as Shelton later confirmed in a social media video that his sister's request for additional paid time off was approved. Shelton has advanced to the fourth round of the tournament without dropping a set.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. The article explores how Twain's identity as "the American" was shaped by both the idyllic adventures that inspired his novels and a persistent fear of poverty that fueled his adult life. Chernow's book examines how Twain's sardonic humor was rooted in personal pain and how his work continues to resonate with modern themes of politics, race, and class. Despite his fame, Twain's life was marked by ill-fated investments, yet his writing remains a vital and widely read part of American culture.</p>

          <h2>Retrospective Look at the Making of the 1975 Blockbuster "Jaws"</h2>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, a new report looks back on the notoriously difficult production of Steven Spielberg's classic film "Jaws." Shot on the open seas of the Atlantic, the production was plagued by a malfunctioning mechanical shark, a ballooning budget, and a schedule that tripled in length. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls that the cast and crew initially believed the film would be a failure. However, the 27-year-old Spielberg turned these challenges into cinematic opportunities, creating a film that ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster and forever changed Hollywood, becoming the highest-grossing movie of its time.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru’s northern Barranca province, which is believed to have been a crucial trading center. The city likely connected early Pacific coast communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin, and its discovery sheds light on the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization. Researchers found 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, along with ceremonial objects and sculptures. The site's strategic location and its connection to the Caral society, which was decimated by climate change, make it a significant find for understanding the region's ancient history.</p>

          <p>A historical analysis reveals that the Statue of Liberty was not originally intended as a symbol of immigration. Proposed in 1865, it was conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, with the statue depicted standing on broken chains and shackles. It was poet Emma Lazarus who, in her 1883 sonnet "The New Colossus," reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles" welcoming immigrants. This new meaning gained prominence with the opening of Ellis Island in 1892 and was later solidified by President John F. Kennedy's popularization of the phrase "a nation of immigrants."</p>

          <p>Despite rising trade tensions at the national level, many local government officials in the United States continue to welcome investment from China. According to the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, city leaders are receptive to Chinese-invested projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. President Trump's tariffs have also increased the incentive for Chinese companies to establish production facilities within the U.S. for domestic sales. The article suggests that while national-level rhetoric has made some investors cautious, the sentiment at the municipal level, especially in Midwestern states, remains positive towards such investment.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political influence in the Western Balkans, using soft power tools like funding the construction of large mosques, such as the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This religious and cultural outreach is part of a broader geopolitical strategy that includes major investments in infrastructure projects across the region and beyond, a policy described as "infrastructure imperialism." President Erdoğan's government positions Turkey as the heir to the Ottoman Empire, leveraging historical ties to further its economic and political interests. While Turkey has become a leading sponsor, overtaking Saudi Arabia, local actors in the Balkans still retain agency in these partnerships.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Bitcoin's adoption rate highlights a fundamental debate over its purpose, with only about 5% of the population owning the cryptocurrency. The article contrasts the original vision of Bitcoin as "peer-to-peer electronic cash" with its current primary use as a "digital gold" or a store of value. Proponents argue that, like gold, widespread ownership isn't necessary for it to be a valuable asset, while critics view it as a speculative collectible with no underlying cash flows. The network's low transaction capacity also poses a practical barrier to its use as a daily currency, leaving its future dependent on developing genuine utility beyond speculation.

          <p>A new analysis explores a growing movement within the Democratic Party that mirrors the grassroots, anti-establishment tactics of the Republican Tea Party from over a decade ago. Fueled by anger at the party's current leadership and a desire for a more populist, progressive direction, activists are looking to challenge incumbent Democrats in primary elections. The recent victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary is seen as a key example of this energy. While the movement lacks a single, unified policy platform, it is broadly focused on working-class affordability issues and a change in leadership from figures like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new animated film, "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box office success, particularly among Christian audiences. The movie, featuring a star-studded voice cast, aims for broad appeal by telling the biblical story through a historical lens and avoiding overt political messaging. However, this review argues that despite its aspirations, the film's on-the-nose evangelism and often awkward attempts at humor make it unlikely to resonate with viewers who are not already believers. The article contrasts it with more nuanced biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt," suggesting the film is a missed opportunity for the genre.</p>

          <p>Five months into President Trump's second term, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly stable, defying both the administration's promises of a "golden age" and critics' predictions of an "economic catastrophe." Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have seen little change, and while GDP growth has slowed, it has not collapsed. The article argues that Trump's more extreme tariff policies were quickly moderated, preventing a major trade war, while his other economic policies have had a limited short-term impact. The economy is described as simply "okay," which may be a political problem for a president whose supporters expect more dramatic results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a cultural analysis of a pivotal moment in professional wrestling history: Hulk Hogan's 1996 transformation from an all-American hero into a villain. This narrative shift, known as a "heel turn," created the New World Order faction and revitalized World Championship Wrestling's popularity. The piece explores how this successful storyline blurred the lines between performance and reality for audiences, creating a powerful cultural moment. It also reflects on the potential connection between the rise of villainous anti-heroes in wrestling and the later success of Donald Trump's political persona, suggesting wrestling fans were uniquely prepared for the political shifts to come.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Cologne, Germany, for the city's annual Christopher Street Day (CSD) Pride parade. Organizers expected around 60,000 active participants and 90 floats to join the march, which is one of the largest LGBTQ+ celebrations in Europe. The event, held under the motto "For queer rights. Many. Together. Strong.," traces its origins to the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York. The article also notes that other Pride events took place in eastern Germany, where they were met with some far-right counter-protests, though both demonstrations remained peaceful.</p>
