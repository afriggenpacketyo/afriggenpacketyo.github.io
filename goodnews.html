Head coach Todd Blackadder emphasized that the combined leadership of Mo'unga and Leitch was the foundation for Brave Lupus becoming the first two-time champions in the League One era.

          <h2>UK Airspace Redesign Aims for Faster Flights and Reduced Delays</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths through the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. Many of the current routes were established approximately 70 years ago and are in need of an overhaul to meet modern demands. The initial focus of the redesign will be on the complex airspace in and around London. However, concerns have been raised by community groups that the changes could introduce new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <p>An Indian man was arrested at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle dozens of rare reptiles, including venomous vipers, into the country. Customs officials found 44 Indonesian pit vipers, three spider-tailed horned vipers, and five Asian leaf turtles concealed in the man's luggage. While importing animals is not illegal, India's wildlife protection law prohibits importing certain species, especially those endangered or protected by the government, without proper permits. This incident is one of several recent cases where passengers have been caught smuggling prohibited wildlife into India.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are working to address the underrepresentation of Southeast Asian populations in global genomic databases, which were largely overlooked by the Human Genome Project. The Kunming Institute of Zoology has collaborated with 34 Southeast Asian research teams to create the SEA3K data set, the first comprehensive genomic atlas of the region. The study has revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east. The initiative seeks to rectify the historical bias and provide a more complete understanding of human genetic diversity.</p>
