          <h2>Bitcoin Value Increases as Investors Seek Safe Haven During US Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 09:18:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price saw an increase as other risk assets declined after the U.S. government officially shut down due to a funding impasse in Congress. This movement suggests a growing perception of the cryptocurrency as a store of value during times of geopolitical and economic instability, similar to traditional safe havens like gold. As lawmakers failed to reach an agreement, investors appeared to move capital into alternative assets, with Bitcoin trading approximately 2% higher. The cryptocurrency's appreciation this year reflects its increasing acceptance among institutional investors and its evolving role in diversified portfolios.</p>

          <p>A major retrospective at London's Tate Britain museum is celebrating the multifaceted career of American photographer Lee Miller, from her beginnings as a model and surrealist muse to her groundbreaking work as a war correspondent. The exhibition highlights her artistic journey, including her collaboration with Man Ray in Paris, her surrealist-influenced photographs of the Egyptian desert, and her powerful photojournalism during World War II. One of her most iconic images captures her in Hitler's bathtub on the day of his death, a testament to her unique ability to merge art with historical documentation. The collection showcases her profound impact on 20th-century photography.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has mandated that every General Practitioner (GP) practice in England must provide online appointment booking services throughout the workday to alleviate the morning phone rush. This new rule requires surgeries to offer online access from 8:00 to 18:30 on weekdays, allowing patients to book non-urgent appointments and submit queries. Despite the change, some patients have reported difficulties accessing the new systems. The British Medical Association had previously raised concerns that this could overwhelm practices and lead to missed diagnoses, but the government proceeded, citing significant investment to support the digital transition.</p>

This article provides an overview of current national average CD rates for various terms, while highlighting that online banks often offer significantly higher rates. To secure the best rates, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider short-term CDs, which currently feature higher yields due to an inverted yield curve.

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have named rookie Dillon Gabriel as the starting quarterback for their upcoming Week 5 game against the Minnesota Vikings, replacing veteran Joe Flacco. Gabriel, a third-round draft pick from Oregon, will make his first NFL start after Flacco struggled in recent games, throwing three interceptions and no touchdowns over the last two weeks. The decision comes as the team seeks to improve its offensive performance. In limited action this season, Gabriel has completed 3 of 4 passes for 19 yards and a touchdown, showing promise during his brief appearances on the field.</p>

          <h2>Pfizer Drug Pricing Deal Lessens Impact of President Trump's Tariff Threats on Pharmaceutical Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 08:56:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals has been softened by a new drug-pricing agreement with Pfizer, which includes a three-year exemption from such levies in exchange for domestic investment. This deal, which involves Pfizer voluntarily lowering some U.S. drug prices, has reassured the broader pharmaceutical industry that similar pacts can be reached, mitigating the risk of widespread tariffs. Following the announcement, shares of Pfizer and other major drugmakers like Eli Lilly and AbbVie rose. The agreement signals a path for other companies to negotiate with the administration, reducing uncertainty over potential punitive measures.</p>

          <p>Shares of Lithium Americas surged over 35% after the U.S. Department of Energy announced it will take a 5% equity stake in both the company and its Thacker Pass mining project in Nevada. This move is part of a renegotiated $2.2 billion federal loan aimed at boosting domestic production of lithium, a critical mineral for electric vehicle batteries. The government's investment underscores the White House's strategy to secure the nation's mineral supply chain and enhance energy security. The Thacker Pass mine, in which General Motors also holds a stake, is poised to become a major North American source of lithium.</p>
