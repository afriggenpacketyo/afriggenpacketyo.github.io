          <h2>Countering Autocracy: The Strategy of Anticipatory Noncompliance Against Trump's Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 07:00:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Kirp argues that institutions are engaging in 'anticipatory compliance' by preemptively bending to Donald Trump's will, thus smoothing the path to autocracy. He advocates for 'anticipatory noncompliance' as a counter-strategy, highlighting examples of universities, states, and companies pushing back against Trump's demands. The article cites instances where institutions have challenged Trump's actions in education, law, and business, and points to rising popular opposition. The author emphasizes the need for sustained resistance through various tactics to restore democracy, drawing on James Baldwin's message that change requires facing challenges head-on.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions through the discovery and distribution of misoprostol, a drug initially designed for stomach ulcers. Activists connected and spread the word about misoprostol, enabling women to end pregnancies despite legal restrictions in most Latin American countries. They established hotlines and published manuals, providing information and support for women seeking abortions. Accompaniment networks like Las Libres in Mexico and Socorristas en Red in Argentina emerged, offering comprehensive support throughout the abortion process and contributing to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>

          <p>In the case of Ames v. Ohio, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, was discriminated against when she was demoted and replaced by a gay man. The court's opinion, written by Justice Jackson, underscores the importance of treating individuals as individuals rather than as members of a group. This ruling is relevant to the debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) and the extent to which the law should provide assistance to targeted groups to increase diversity and overcome systemic discrimination. The ruling emphasizes the need to cease malicious discrimination but raises questions about affirmative action.</p>
