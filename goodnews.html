          <p>Researchers in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees utilizing medicinal plants in various ways to treat injuries and maintain hygiene. The observations, which include chimps dabbing plants on wounds and applying chewed plant material to open injuries, build on previous discoveries of chimpanzees self-medicating with specific plants. The study also noted instances of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of unrelated individuals, suggesting empathy. Scientists have identified antibacterial properties in some of the plants used by the chimps, furthering the understanding of primate self-medication and social behavior.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services; however, these offices face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The demand for skilled professionals is high, with family offices competing against banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. Trust is a key criterion for family offices when hiring, often outweighing other qualifications, and families are willing to pay a premium to secure trusted individuals. Young employees are sometimes reluctant to work for family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and undefined career progression.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines highlight the release of Peter Sullivan, who was exonerated after serving 38 years for a murder he did not commit, with DNA evidence leading to his conviction being quashed. Several papers also focus on promising research into new weight-loss drugs, specifically GLP-1 agonists, which have shown to halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks in trials. Counter-terrorism police are investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home, and authorities are urging concerned MPs to contact the police. The Daily Mirror highlighted the case of Peter Sullivan, after his conviction for the murder of Diane Sindall in 1986 was dramatically quashed.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal, presented by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to American special envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. Unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, this joint venture would be permanent, allowing for greater oversight with representatives from other countries. President Trump has expressed a desire to make a deal with Iran to improve regional safety, but warned that time is limited.</p>

          <p>Even as the United States and China take steps to reduce trade war tensions, Beijing is preparing for continued broader rivalry with Washington, which means China's pursuit of economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia is unlikely to soften its tough line on regional territorial claims and military competition. While a tariff truce may open the way for talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping, Beijing remains wary of U.S. intentions and is preparing for potential flare-ups in tensions. China aims to present itself as a stable and trustworthy alternative to the U.S. while simultaneously asserting its regional power and ambitions, particularly in the South China Sea and regarding Taiwan.</p>

The visit included a tour of Saudi megaprojects and a "gallery of memories" showcasing the long-standing Saudi-American partnership.

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily charge an extra 17 percent for homeowners‚Äô insurance policies in California, following approval from the state after catastrophic wildfires. This decision comes after a previous 20 percent rate increase last year, drawing criticism from consumer groups and homeowners who report claim delays and lowball offers. The insurance commissioner framed the increase as a difficult compromise amidst a statewide insurance crisis, while Consumer Watchdog contends that State Farm has not justified the need for such a large rate hike.
