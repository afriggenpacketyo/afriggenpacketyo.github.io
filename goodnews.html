          <p>Redshirt freshman King Miller, a walk-on, delivered a breakout performance for USC, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown after the team's top two running backs were sidelined by injuries during a crucial Big Ten battle. His impactful third-quarter run helped secure a commanding 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan, marking a significant and much-needed win for coach Lincoln Riley against a ranked opponent. The Trojans' defense also showed vast improvement from previous weeks, stifling Michigan's potent offense and holding them to a meager 3.5 yards per carry. This resounding statement win, achieved under challenging circumstances, significantly boosts USC's season trajectory and highlights Miller's potential for a scholarship.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Chicago Cubs 3-1 in the decisive fifth game of their National League Division Series, securing their first postseason series win since 2018. Timely home runs from Andrew Vaughn, William Contreras, and Brice Turang fueled the Brewers' offense, while an effective all-hands-on-deck pitching strategy successfully limited the Cubs to just one run. This hard-fought victory was particularly sweet for Milwaukee fans, as it came against their biggest rival and eliminated former manager Craig Counsell, who now manages the Cubs. The Brewers now advance to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series, aiming for their second World Series appearance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are preparing for a formidable challenge in the NL Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, with nine key concerns highlighted by their opponent's unique team approach. Milwaukee, operating with a significantly lower payroll than the Dodgers, relies on a potent small-ball offense, exceptional pitching, and impressive roster depth, having previously swept the Dodgers twice in July. Key players like veteran right-hander Freddy Peralta, who led the NL in wins, and breakout starter Quinn Priester lead a formidable pitching staff. The Brewers' offensive depth, featuring Christian Yelich and Andrew Vaughn, makes them tough outs, posing a significant strategic challenge for the Dodgers.</p>

          <h2>Chinese TV Series Honors Communist Spies in Taiwan</h2>

          <p>China's state broadcaster CCTV has premiered "Silent Honour," a new TV series commemorating the Communist Party's espionage activities in Taiwan during the final months of the civil war. This marks a rare public acknowledgment of these covert operations, which historically met with harsh suppression and execution of many operatives by the KMT after their retreat to the island in June 1949. The 39-episode drama, airing on Martyrs' Day, reflects a notable shift in Beijing's approach to publicly narrating this sensitive historical period, aiming to honor the sacrifices made by its agents. This state-guided production offers a new perspective on a clandestine chapter of Chinese history.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's batting performance in the Dodgers' NLDS was woeful, with a 1-for-18 record and nine strikeouts, raising significant concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series. Manager Dave Roberts attributed some of the struggles to facing numerous left-handed pitchers but emphatically stated Ohtani needs to improve his "at-bat quality," particularly in managing the strike zone. The team acknowledges that such a performance is unsustainable for a World Series run, highlighting the immense pressure on their superstar to recalibrate his approach. Roberts hopes for a quick adjustment from their $700-million player.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight David Allen suffered a unanimous points defeat to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at a raucous Sheffield Arena.

The "White Rhino" showed toughness and landed significant blows, but the judges scored heavily in favor of his undefeated opponent, marking another setback in Allen's determined comeback journey.

          <p>In the UK, clocks will revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday of October, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and providing an extra hour for most people. The change, happening at 02:00 BST on Sunday, October 26, will bring sunsets forward by an hour, potentially impacting daily routines and daylight exposure. Debates persist about making BST permanent, with arguments for potential boosts in economic productivity and a possible reduction in evening road accidents. However, concerns about significantly darker winter mornings, especially in Scotland where sunrise could be as late as 9:45 BST, remain a key point of contention.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, including common colds, flu, and new Covid variants, leading many to feel unwell with symptoms like sore throats and sinus pressure. Experts attribute this prevalence to a "perfect breeding ground" created by children returning to school and adults to work, coupled with increased indoor mixing as weather cools and waning population immunity. While Rhinovirus is currently the most prevalent, and flu and RSV are also rising, health officials state current illness levels are not unusually high, emphasizing the importance of vaccinations for vulnerable groups.</p>
