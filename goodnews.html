          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile, priced at $47.45 per month with unlimited calls, text, and data. The company also plans to release a $499 phone manufactured in the U.S., coinciding with the 10-year anniversary of Trump's first presidential run announcement. Eric Trump stated the new phone and service align with the company's goal to boost American manufacturing and employment. The move raises ethics concerns, with potential conflicts of interest for rival companies and questions about the origin of phone parts, potentially distorting the economy around the Trump brand.</p>

          <p>Former Real Madrid and Wales star Gareth Bale is reportedly part of a US-based consortium attempting to take over League One club Plymouth Argyle. Talks with the private equity firm are in the early stages, and it is unknown what role Bale would have if the takeover succeeds. Bale's potential involvement follows similar moves by other athletes, such as Luka Modric's participation in the acquisition of Swansea. Plymouth was relegated to the third tier last season and recently appointed Tom Cleverley as manager.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is undergoing a significant restructuring to cut costs and accelerate the adoption of new technologies. The Army Transformation Initiative aims to shift defense dollars to products that can be made quickly and cheaply, as battlefields become more autonomous. The initiative involves expanding beyond the rigid acquisition process that has defined defense procurement. The goal is to infuse formations with technologies that will be more effective on the battlefield, reflecting a paradigm shift in military strategy.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares rallied after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with all regulatory approvals now received.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza claims she sang the national anthem in Spanish at Dodger Stadium against the team's wishes, posting a video where a Dodgers employee told her to sing in English. Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa Hern√°ndez, said she wanted to sing the Spanish version, commissioned in 1945 by the U.S. State Department, in response to recent immigration raids. The Dodgers have not made a public comment on the situation, but a team official said there would be no consequences and that Nezza would be welcome back.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission has successfully created an artificial solar eclipse using two spacecraft flying in a precise formation. This allows scientists to observe the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere, in unprecedented detail. The mission aims to improve understanding of the solar corona and solar weather. The twin spacecraft, Occulter and Coronagraph, create artificial solar eclipses every 19 hours and 36 minutes in orbit and hold their precision flying formation for six hours.</p>
