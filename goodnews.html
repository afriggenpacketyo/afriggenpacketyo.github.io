          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to warn the public to avoid the area. Beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and find their queen, with the goal of saving as many as possible. The road where the incident occurred was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the rescue efforts. Officials initially misreported the number of escaped bees as 250 million, later correcting the figure with the help of a beekeeper. </p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper in a surprising turn of events during the series finale of Doctor Who. Piper, who previously played the Doctor's companion Rose Tyler, will return to the show in an undisclosed capacity. Gatwa described his journey as the Doctor as unforgettable, while the BBC hinted at the mystery surrounding Piper's reappearance. Gatwa's 18-month tenure as the Doctor is the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005. </p>

          <p>Dodgers star Mookie Betts sustained a fractured toe after reportedly bumping it into a wall while walking to the bathroom in the dark.

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has risen at El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn due to soaring egg costs. Owners Freddy and Yovanna Melo had to increase the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, because egg prices more than doubled. The Melos closely monitor their costs and aim for a profit margin of 20-30 percent per item, necessitating price increases across the board. The bodega's revenue has declined over the years, but rental income from apartments above the store helps sustain the business. </p>
