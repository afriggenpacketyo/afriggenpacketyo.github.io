        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely saw gains on Friday, as investors keenly awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the central bank's annual economic symposium for insights into future interest rate policy. South Korea's Kospi and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced notable jumps, while Japan's Nikkei 225 remained flat and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged lower after recently crossing the 9,000 mark. The overall market sentiment is heavily influenced by the high probability, currently around 74%, of a potential Fed rate cut at its next policy meeting in September, according to CME's FedWatch tool. This reflects a cautious yet hopeful outlook on global economic stability and monetary easing, despite some regional market variations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly scaled back his previous threat of imposing tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union. New details of the EU-U.S. trade agreement confirm these crucial sectors will now face a 15% tariff, aligning with most other goods covered by the deal. This reduction, however, is contingent on the EU first passing legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods, including agricultural products, before car export tariffs are also lowered. The agreement, described as a "first step," aims to provide predictability and stability in the world's largest trading partnership, though some sectors like wine and spirits remain disappointed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has temporarily halted an earlier order for the mass removal of stray dogs in New Delhi, instead directing authorities to sterilize and immunize the animals before releasing them, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, mandating designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action against violators. This decision comes after a previous order to capture 5,000 dogs sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists, who called it "illogical, impractical, inhuman, and illegal." The court cited a surge in dog bite cases, nearly 2,000 daily, as a key concern.</p>

This landmark takeover is drawing significant attention from the global Sikh community, with the new owners emphasizing principles of discipline, trustfulness, and compassion in their approach to club management. The move is seen as a major step in increasing Sikh visibility and representation in British football, inspiring underrepresented groups to pursue their dreams in the sport. Experts believe the community will closely watch to ensure the club lives up to Sikh values.</p>

          <p>A Bangkok court has acquitted former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of charges of insulting the monarchy, a verdict that could have resulted in a 15-year jail sentence under the country's strict lese majeste law. The case stemmed from a 2015 interview where he allegedly implicated "people in the palace" in the 2014 coup. Critics often view Thailand's lese majeste law as a political tool against opponents, but the judges interpreted the law literally, noting no specific names were mentioned. This ruling provides significant relief to the Shinawatra family's political movement, even as Thaksin's daughter, the suspended PM, faces her own legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to intensify efforts against individuals wrongly claiming child benefit while residing outside the country, aiming to save £350 million over the next five years. Claimants generally lose eligibility after eight weeks abroad, barring exceptional circumstances, with a longer limit for medical or bereavement reasons. A new specialist team of over 200 investigators will utilize travel data to identify and halt incorrect payments, building on a successful pilot program that recovered £17 million. This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the rules and combat benefit fraud, which has increased post-pandemic, representing 2.2% of all benefit expenditure.</p>

The company acknowledged taking inspiration from the town's traditional designs without direct collaboration, causing discomfort and accusations of cultural appropriation. This apology follows national attention, including criticism from President Claudia Sheinbaum, regarding the exploitation of Indigenous culture and the need for stronger protections against global brands copying traditional designs.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction effectively halting operations at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, citing profound environmental concerns. The ruling prohibits further detainee transfers or new construction and mandates the removal of temporary infrastructure like fencing, industrial lighting, generators, and sewage receptacles within 60 days. Environmental groups and a Native American Tribe sued, arguing the facility violated the National Environmental Policy Act and risked irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. This decision is a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's immigration policies and a landmark victory for environmental protection in a region pledged to conservation.</p>

His comments come amid U.S. interest in acquiring stakes in tech firms receiving CHIPS Act funding, with TSMC promised $6.6 billion for three U.S. fabrication plants. Huang's visit to Taiwan was primarily to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, and six other new products. He also discussed Nvidia's plans for a new Taiwan office, "NVIDIA Constellation," to support its growing workforce and supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

Toyota stated its July price increases were regular annual adjustments for various operational costs, not a response to tariffs, despite projecting a significant tariff impact of 1.4 trillion yen for the full year. Honda also affirmed it has avoided direct tariff-related price hikes, attributing this to its high proportion of American-made vehicles. These denials come after Japan's auto tariffs were reduced from 25% to 15% following a trade deal with the Trump administration, offering some relief to the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest China could potentially beat NASA back to the Moon, citing NASA's Artemis program's delays, budget problems, and leadership issues.

          <p>An international study has uncovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. This newly discovered mechanism offers potential avenues for optimizing linalool release to combat pests and enhance crop yield. Researchers observed that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage than those at the edges, but also showed reduced growth. The findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, shed light on intricate plant-to-plant interactions and their significant implications for future agricultural practices and pest management strategies.</p>
