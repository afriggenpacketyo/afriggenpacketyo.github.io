          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a successful August with gains, although the final week saw a slight downturn as the S&P 500 retreated from a record high. This dip, which ended a four-week winning streak, was partly driven by profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a modest decline in Nvidia's stock despite a strong earnings report. Inflation concerns also resurfaced as the Fed's preferred gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at its highest annual rate since February. Markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September following recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a Senate probe and public criticism, Meta is temporarily modifying its AI chatbots to prevent inappropriate conversations with teenage users. The changes will train the AI to avoid topics like self-harm and disordered eating, instead directing teens to expert resources, and will also block potentially romantic discussions. This move comes after reports revealed internal documents permitting "sensual" conversations with minors and a risk assessment from Common Sense Media deemed Meta AI unsafe for anyone under 18. The company stated it is strengthening protections as it learns how young people interact with these tools.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines but has narrowed the eligibility criteria for receiving them. Unlike previous rollouts where shots were available to nearly everyone, the updated vaccines are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with specific underlying health problems that make them more vulnerable to the virus. This shift in public health strategy reflects a more targeted approach to vaccination as the pandemic continues to evolve, moving away from broad recommendations.</p>

          <p>With the 2026 midterm elections approaching, the political landscape for control of the U.S. Senate is starting to take shape, with several key contests emerging across the country. Democrats face a challenging map, defending 13 seats compared to the Republicans' 24, but with few clear opportunities to flip GOP-held seats. Races in states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan are expected to be highly competitive and expensive, influenced by retirements and strong candidate recruitment from both parties. These contests will be crucial in determining the Senate majority and the legislative direction of the country.</p>

          <p>Shares of buy-now, pay-later company Affirm jumped 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. The company's gross merchandise volume grew significantly, driven by strong consumer transaction frequency and key partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon. CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in continued consumer strength and the company's ability to manage loan performance. The positive results and upbeat guidance for the upcoming fiscal year have alleviated concerns about increased competition and the loss of Walmart as a partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits for its fiscal first quarter, causing its U.S.-listed stock to climb nearly 13%. The strong performance was primarily fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, which is benefiting from robust demand for artificial intelligence services. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the cloud unit's growth and improvements in the company's e-commerce businesses. The results signal that Alibaba's strategic investments in high-growth areas like AI are beginning to yield significant returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can probe State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to firestorm claims, alleging payment delays and underpayments. The ruling denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to separate the inquiry from the rate review, connecting the insurer's service quality directly to its request for higher premiums. This sets a precedent for holding insurers accountable for their claims processes.</p>

          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the armed robbery of rapper Macklemore's home in June. The investigation, a collaboration between multiple law enforcement agencies, led detectives to a jewelry store where items stolen from Macklemore's residence and other recent celebrity burglaries were recovered. During the home invasion, two men entered the house and used bear spray on the rapper's nanny before stealing thousands of dollars worth of personal items. The suspect was arrested for a separate robbery, and authorities are continuing to investigate other high-profile burglaries in the area.</p>

A former Secretary of Labor and member of Congress, Solis is seeking to run in a redrawn, heavily Democratic district in southeast L.A. County. Her campaign launched with a strong list of endorsements from prominent Democrats, signaling significant establishment support. The potential redistricting is part of a broader Democratic strategy to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states and could be pivotal for control of Congress in 2026.</p>

The event, featuring a game between Morehouse College and Johnson C. Smith University, is designed as a cultural celebration to amplify the profile of HBCUs. Organizers chose Boston to connect with the large local HBCU alumni community and to challenge historical narratives about the city's racial dynamics. The four-day event includes a battle of the bands, a step show, and a tailgate, aiming to create an atmosphere similar to a traditional HBCU homecoming.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector at a beach in Mt. Sinai, New York. The finder, David Orlowski, was able to trace the ring's owner, Al DiStefano, through its engravings and with the help of a fellow alumnus on Facebook. DiStefano, now 77, called the ring's return a "miracle," celebrating an act of kindness that connected strangers across decades and distances.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was an unusually armed herbivore that lived 165 million years ago. The findings, published in 'Nature,' show the dinosaur had long bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate species. Described by researchers as a "punk rocker" dinosaur, this discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs. It suggests that complex and bizarre armor appeared much earlier in their lineage than previously thought, rather than evolving gradually in response to later predators.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has won re-election in a landslide, four years after facing efforts by white residents to prevent him from taking office. In 2020, after running unopposed, Braxton alleged he was locked out of the town hall by previous officials who refused to cede power. This week's election, the town's first in decades, was held under a federal settlement following a lawsuit by Black residents challenging the town's long-standing "hand-me-down" system of governance. Braxton's decisive victory is seen as a major step toward restoring democratic processes in the small, majority-Black town.</p>
