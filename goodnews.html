        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, is not effective in preventing travelers' diarrhea compared to a placebo. The study, involving 270 participants traveling to Southeast Asia, south central Asia, North Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa, found no significant difference in symptoms of loose stool or diarrhea between those who took Pepto Bismol preventatively and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and upset stomach, its off-label use for prevention, especially among international travelers, has been questioned by this new data. Further studies are needed to determine if there is a benefit in certain traveler groups or under specific circumstances.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California has expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's visa policies could negatively impact the U.S. economy and talent pipeline by discouraging international students from attending American colleges. Khanna, representing Silicon Valley, emphasized that foreign students contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, citing examples like Elon Musk who was a foreign student. He noted that world-class educational opportunities for foreign students are a major U.S. export, and that many universities rely on international students to support employment and defray costs for American students. According to NAFSA, international students contributed roughly $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2023-2024 school year.</p>

          <p>Anthropic's Claude 4 AI model has achieved a breakthrough by working continuously for seven hours, a significant advancement in AI capabilities. Unlike humans, Claude doesn't require breaks, but like an exhausted worker, its performance degrades after this period due to limitations in computing power and memory. The key to AI's longevity on the job lies in increasing the number of "tokens," which are words or word fragments that AI models intake through prompts, impacting the LLM's memory capacity. While a 24-hour AI workday may be technically possible in the future, the question remains whether it's desirable and at what cost, considering the environmental impact and resource demands.</p>
