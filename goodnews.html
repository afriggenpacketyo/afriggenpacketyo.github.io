          <p>Despite facing backlash, the movement to defund the police has led to lasting changes in some cities, including Milwaukee, Seattle, and Austin. This article reports that Milwaukee redirected police funding to affordable housing and youth programs, while Seattle created a third public safety department focused on mental health crises. Austin invested more in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. While public sentiment has shifted since 2020, organizers say the movement sparked important conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that UK employees work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week, compared to the international average of 1.3 days. Hybrid working patterns have become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. This trend is attributed to the cost and length of commuting, especially in London and south-east England. Despite some companies mandating a return to the office, home working levels in the UK have stabilized since 2023, with women and parents more likely to resist strict return mandates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study challenges the notion that homemade foods are inherently healthier than processed options, suggesting they are not necessarily nutritionally superior or safer. This article reports that the study compared nutritional values and harmful compounds in both types of food, finding no significant difference. An expert from the Institute of Food Technologists notes that food processing is essentially a larger-scale version of home cooking techniques, often with tighter controls for temperature and hygiene. While home preparation allows for control over ingredients, monitoring nutritional parameters remains crucial regardless of where the food is prepared.</p>

          <p>New research traces the sensitivity of human teeth to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. The study, published in Nature, reveals that structures in the armor of these fish, previously thought to be scales, were used for sensing. The research suggests that our teeth inherited the ability to sense things like pain and temperature from these ancient fish. This explains why we experience toothaches and the zing from cold treats, connecting our dental woes to evolutionary history.</p>
