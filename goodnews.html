          <p>The price disparity between the Hong Kong-listed (H shares) and mainland-listed (A shares) stocks of dual-listed Chinese firms has narrowed to its smallest point since June 2020. According to a Hang Seng gauge, H shares are now trading at a 22% discount, compared to an average of 29% over the past year. Analysts attribute this trend to a weaker US dollar prompting global investors to diversify into the Hong Kong market. Additionally, mainland investors are increasingly buying H shares to gain exposure to major technology companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BRICS bloc, now expanded, is projecting increased confidence and positioning itself as an alternative to Western-led global dominance, notably calling for de-dollarization. However, this opinion article argues that the group stands at a crossroads, facing significant internal contradictions that challenge its coherence. While no longer just a diplomatic acronym, the diverging interests of members like India, Brazil, and South Africa undermine its potential to become a true alternative to the G7. The piece questions whether BRICS can overcome these fractures to evolve from a strategic partnership into a structured institution of global power.</p>

          <h2>China Moves to Enhance Legal Framework to Counter Foreign Sanctions and Interference</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:20:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Communist Party has publicly released a directive aimed at strengthening the country's legal system to better counter foreign sanctions and what it terms as interference. The policy paper, first circulated internally in February, outlines plans to refine China's judicial toolkit for challenging trade and technology restrictions, such as those imposed by the United States. The directive calls for the establishment of an advanced system to understand and engage with foreign law. This move is part of a broader strategy to sharpen legal instruments to protect China's national interests on the global stage.</p>

          <p>The UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 index has reached a new record, breaking the 9,000-point barrier for the first time in its history. Analysts suggest the London market has benefited from several factors in 2025, including investors diversifying away from US stocks amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. The UK's established trade deal with the US and its concentration of reliable, long-established companies have made it an attractive, stable option in an uncertain global environment. Top-performing stocks include precious metals producer Fresnillo and defense contractors like Babcock and BAE Systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes played a pivotal role in securing a 22-run victory over India in the third Test at Lord's, giving his team a 2-1 series lead. Despite concerns over his fitness, Stokes delivered marathon bowling spells, taking crucial wickets on the final day, including the dismissal of the last two Indian batsmen. His leadership and on-field efforts were instrumental, orchestrating the win on the sixth anniversary of his 2019 World Cup final heroics at the same venue. The match also marked the triumphant return of pace bowler Jofra Archer to Test cricket after a four-year absence.</p>

The summit, organized by Republican Senator Dave McCormick, is expected to announce $70 billion in new investments in the state's energy and technology sectors. A key focus will be on developing data centers to power artificial intelligence. The event follows Amazon's recent $20 billion data center investment in Pennsylvania and will also be attended by Governor Josh Shapiro and several of the president's cabinet members, though some student protests are anticipated.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is reportedly considering expanding the tournament from 32 to 48 teams for the 2029 edition. The event, initially met with criticism, has proven financially successful, with a $1 billion prize fund attracting top clubs and generating significant revenue. During the tournament, some clubs, including Real Madrid, even proposed holding the competition every two years, though FIFA has no current plans to do so. Despite the commercial success and high viewership, concerns from players' unions regarding welfare and fixture congestion remain a significant, unresolved issue for the competition's future.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The £650 million program will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with the goal of making zero-emission cars more affordable for families. The move is part of the government's plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. However, industry experts and drivers note that a significant expansion of the UK's public charging infrastructure is also crucial to spur widespread EV adoption.</p>

This article details how Scheffler, once ranked outside the top 150 in putting, sought help from renowned English coach Phil Kenyon in late 2023. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip but a key change was switching to a mallet-style putter, which improved his alignment. The transformation has been remarkable, turning Scheffler's one major weakness into a strength and solidifying his position as the world's best player.</p>
