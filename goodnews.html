          <p>Despite a challenging political climate regarding diversity and inclusion initiatives, LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs are launching businesses at a record rate, according to a survey by Gusto. Last year, 10% of new business founders identified as LGBTQ+, a 50% increase from 2023, bringing their representation in entrepreneurship to parity with the general population. Many founders state their motivation is to create inclusive, safe spaces and to positively impact their communities, demonstrating resilience and a desire for autonomy. These businesses contribute an estimated $1.7 trillion to the U.S. economy, according to the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce.</p>

          <p>In Far West Texas, a collaborative effort is underway to protect one of the world's largest 'dark sky reserves' from the growing threat of light pollution. The McDonald Observatory, a hub for both astronomical research and tourism, has spearheaded initiatives with local cities, counties, and even oil and gas companies to adopt dark-sky-friendly lighting. This 15,000-square-mile reserve is crucial not only for scientific study but also for the local economy and wildlife. As light pollution increases globally, this region's success in preserving its natural nighttime environment serves as a model for conservation and maintaining a connection to the cosmos.</p>

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone increased slightly to 2% in June, aligning perfectly with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in months. The data from Eurostat met economists' expectations, following a period of fluctuating rates across major European economies. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like energy and food, remained steady at 2.3%, while the closely monitored services inflation saw a minor uptick. Following the announcement, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane suggested that the central bank's cycle of interventions to control peak inflation is likely complete, signaling a potential stabilization of monetary policy in the near future.

          <p>Starting this month, approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills decrease by about 7% under the new Ofgem price cap. While the immediate ¬£11 monthly reduction is a welcome relief, concerns persist about price volatility heading into the winter. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts only a minor additional drop in October and notes that prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Regulator Ofgem is encouraging consumers to consider fixed-rate deals for more payment certainty and has provisionally approved a ¬£24 billion investment to upgrade UK energy infrastructure, aiming for a more stable system in the long run.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after his death, the influence of Louisville on legendary writer Hunter S. Thompson remains profound, evident in several key locations. Churchill Downs was the setting for his seminal 1970 article on the Kentucky Derby, which gave birth to his signature "Gonzo journalism" style. Early in his career, The Courier Journal published his more traditional freelance work, offering a glimpse of his developing voice. The Louisville Free Public Library, where his mother worked, and the nearby Cherokee Park were formative spaces during his youth, fostering his love for literature and serving as the backdrop for a pivotal arrest that altered the course of his life.</p>

          <p>Colin Allred, a former NFL player and three-term Democratic congressman from Dallas, has officially launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate in Texas for the 2026 election. His entry sets the stage for a high-profile race, with national Democrats targeting the seat as a potential pickup opportunity. The Republican primary is already contentious, featuring a challenge by Attorney General Ken Paxton against incumbent Sen. John Cornyn. While Democrats have not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994, they hope that shifting suburban demographics and a potentially divisive GOP primary could create a path to victory in the increasingly competitive state.</p>

In California, a bill is advancing that would require physicians to complete coursework on menopause to renew their licenses. This is part of a national trend, with 13 states introducing legislation this year to improve menopause-related care and education for both providers and patients. Experts note that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training, leaving many doctors ill-equipped to treat common symptoms like hot flashes, mood changes, and cognitive issues.</p>

By making its models freely available, Huawei hopes to incentivize developers and businesses to build applications on its platform, which is integrated with its Ascend AI chips. This strategy positions Huawei as a key player across the entire AI value chain, from hardware to software, helping it compete with rivals like Nvidia and Baidu.

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed an optimized model using satellite remote sensing data to more accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from individual power plants. The study, published in a scientific journal, presents a new framework that could provide a standardized, high-precision methodology for the global carbon inventory, which currently lacks such a system. The team stated their results show "significant potential" for this technology to retrospectively analyze historical data, detect anomalous emission events, and be applied to other industrial sources like steel plants or oil and gas fields, improving global emissions tracking.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal achieved a historic 4-3 victory over English Premier League champions Manchester City in a thrilling Club World Cup match in Florida. The stunning upset marks the first time an Asian club has defeated a European side in an official FIFA tournament. Despite being without key players, Al-Hilal twice came from behind before a late winner from Marcos Leonardo secured the win. The result is seen as a significant moment for Saudi football, which has invested heavily to grow its global profile, and ends Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's previously perfect winning record in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Gemma Grainger, the head coach of Norway's women's national team, is the sole English manager at the Euro 2025 tournament. The 42-year-old from Middlesbrough, who previously coached Wales, has spent the last 18 months instilling a new, holistic culture in the Norwegian squad, focusing on player empowerment and open communication. Once a powerhouse in women's football, Norway has struggled in recent tournaments, but players like captain Ada Hegerberg have praised Grainger's empathetic and intelligent approach. Grainger aims to guide the team out of a competitive group stage, repaying the faith the Norwegian federation has placed in her.</p>
