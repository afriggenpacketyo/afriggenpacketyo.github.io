          <p>This article explores the historical context and development of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which addresses presidential succession and disability. Years before President Kennedy's assassination, a young lawyer, John Feerick, recognized the absence of clear constitutional instructions for such scenarios. His mission led to the creation of this vital amendment, providing a framework for power transfer if a president becomes unable to serve. The article highlights the foresight and effort behind one of the Constitution's later additions.</p>

          <p>The U.K. economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 0.1% growth, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This growth, primarily driven by services, follows a strong first quarter. Despite the positive figures, economists are cautious, expecting moderation in the third quarter due to a softening labor market and ongoing inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, balancing sticky inflation with subdued growth, suggesting continued vigilance for economic stability.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has rejected a $21,600 copyright claim against Pinkfong's viral children's song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright alleged the 2015 hit copied his 2011 song. However, the court upheld previous rulings, determining that Wright's rendition lacked sufficient originality to warrant protection, as both songs are based on a traditional melody popular at U.S. summer camps. Pinkfong stated the ruling confirms "Baby Shark" is based on a public domain chant, solidifying its legal standing.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney expressed disappointment over NFL legend Tom Brady's "very unfair" comments questioning his work ethic as Birmingham City's head coach.

Rooney clarified that football differs from NFL in terms of player rest and that Brady likely misunderstood the sport's demands.

          <p>A TravelPerk survey indicates that over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing loved ones on work trips, a trend known as "bleisure." Motivations include reclaiming family time and significant cost savings on travel expenses. While generally accepted, many employees do not openly broadcast these plans due to concerns about professionalism or "policy grey zones" regarding expenses and liability. Companies like Omic, however, encourage the practice as long as business objectives are met and costs are clearly separated, recognizing its potential to boost morale.</p>
