          <h2>Gold Price Projections for August Indicate Potential for Market Stagnation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 16:28:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant 40% price increase over the past year, gold prices may stabilize around $3,300 per ounce in August. Key factors contributing to this potential stagnation include the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady, which removes a major catalyst for price shifts. Uncertainty around upcoming inflation data and evolving demand for portfolio diversification also suggest a period of muted activity. The article advises investors to consider gold's long-term role rather than focusing on short-term fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Oxford University reveals that a common species of European songbird sometimes engages in a form of 'divorce' by separating from its partner between breeding seasons. The study explores the social behaviors and mating patterns of these birds, providing new insights into animal relationships. This finding contributes to a deeper understanding of partnership dynamics in the natural world. The behavior challenges previous assumptions about monogamy in certain avian species.</p>

          <p>An analysis of certificate of deposit (CD) rates reveals that savers opening accounts now will earn less interest than they would have in the previous year. For example, a $10,000 deposit in a 3-year CD would earn over $500 less today compared to rates available last August. Despite the decline, CD rates remain relatively high due to the Federal Reserve's pause on rate cuts. The article suggests that CDs are still a favorable savings option compared to alternatives with variable or lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna stated that a heated on-field exchange with England batter Joe Root during the fifth Test was a deliberate tactic to disrupt him. The incident occurred early in Root's innings and prompted an unusually animated response from the English player. Krishna, who took four wickets, described the moment as competitive banter between two players who are friends off the field. The exchange is part of a series marked by high tensions, with India currently holding an advantage in the match.</p>

          <p>The NFL is expected to take an ownership stake in ESPN as part of a new deal with parent company Walt Disney Co. In exchange for equity, ESPN would likely take over the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership comes as ESPN adapts to the decline of traditional pay TV and prepares to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service. The deal would give the NFL a financial interest in one of its major broadcast partners, reshaping future media rights negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized set of exercises for schoolchildren that was phased out in 2013. The test, which includes exercises like the one-mile run and push-ups, was a staple in American physical education for over 50 years. The administration argues its return is necessary to combat declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among youth. While some educators welcome the focus on physical activity, others express concern about the test's potential negative impact on students' mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For 70-year-old homeowners, a reverse mortgage can be a significant source of retirement funds, with the amount they can borrow depending on home value, interest rates, and age. With the current FHA maximum claim at over $1.2 million, a 70-year-old could potentially access a gross amount of nearly $500,000 before fees. The article notes that at this age, borrowers can qualify for substantial loan amounts while being young enough to maximize the long-term benefits, such as using a growing line of credit.
