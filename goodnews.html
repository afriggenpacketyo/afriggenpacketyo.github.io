          <p>The FDA has approved Merck's RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. This approval provides doctors with another option for preventing respiratory syncytial virus, a major cause of infant hospitalizations and deaths. Merck plans to launch Enflonsia before the upcoming RSV season, with orders beginning in July. While both Enflonsia and Beyfortus are preventative monoclonal antibodies, they target different parts of the virus, and Enflonsia can be administered regardless of an infant's weight. This development will be reviewed by the CDC's vaccine advisors later in June.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced it will significantly increase its defense spending to meet NATO's 2% of GDP target by March of next year, years ahead of previous pledges. Prime Minister Mark Carney cited multiplying threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals as the reason for the accelerated timeline. He also acknowledged Canada's over-reliance on the United States for defense. The new strategy includes investing more in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying defense partnerships.</p>

          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on critical minerals like lithium, copper, and cobalt, which are essential for producing, storing, and transmitting electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. Demand for these minerals is projected to increase significantly by 2040, driven by the growth of electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy technologies. However, the uneven distribution of these minerals worldwide and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. Efforts are underway to increase domestic production, find alternative materials, and improve recycling to address critical mineral constraints.</p>
