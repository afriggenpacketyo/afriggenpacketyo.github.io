          <p>Katmai National Park's popular Fat Bear Week competition is starting earlier than usual this year due to an exceptionally strong salmon run that has left the Alaskan brown bears well-fed ahead of schedule. The annual online tournament, where the public votes for their favorite bear bulking up for hibernation, will feature past champions and new contenders. Park officials note that the abundance of food has led to less conflict and more playful behavior among the bears, providing a more harmonious backdrop for the celebrated event.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have agreed to a new framework to address legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to mend a diplomatic rift. The deal involves reforming the UK's controversial legacy body, which will be renamed the Legacy Commission, and ensuring full cooperation from Irish state bodies like the Gardaí. Ireland will also establish its own legacy unit and a victim support fund, with both countries needing to pass new legislation to enact the changes aimed at providing truth and justice for victims.</p>
