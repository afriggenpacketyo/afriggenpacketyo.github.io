          <p>Lithium Americas' stock surged 95% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This move is part of renegotiating a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. The White House aims to secure a small equity stake as a cash buffer for taxpayers, reflecting a broader strategy to gain direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. The Thacker Pass mine is projected to be a significant source of North American lithium, essential for electric vehicle batteries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. debt levels rising, many Americans are struggling to pay off high-interest balances, particularly credit card debt. This article outlines critical mistakes to avoid that can hinder debt repayment progress. Key pitfalls include only making minimum payments, taking on new debt, ignoring professional help, draining emergency funds, and failing to adjust spending habits. The most damaging error is delaying action, as interest compounds quickly. Successfully managing debt requires planning, persistence, and avoiding these common missteps to ensure a smoother and more effective repayment journey. (not investment advice)</p>

This valuation marks a significant increase from $6.4 billion just a year ago, reflecting the rising value of NFL franchises. The sold stake, previously held by the estate of Andrew McKenna, will be divided between the McCaskey and Ryan families.

This article explores several structured approaches to efficiently pay down various obligations. Strategies include the debt snowball method, focusing on smallest balances first for motivational wins, and the debt avalanche method, prioritizing highest interest rates to save money. Other options discussed are balance transfer credit cards with 0% introductory APRs, debt consolidation loans for simplified payments, debt management plans through credit counseling, and debt settlement for severe hardship.

          <h2>Comparing Costs of Home Equity Loans and HELOCs After Fed Rate Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their equity are weighing the costs of home equity loans versus Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs, also known as home equity lines of credit), especially as the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates. This article compares the monthly payments for a $100,000 loan/HELOC over 10 and 15 years, noting that HELOCs currently offer slightly lower variable rates, while home equity loans have fixed rates. While HELOCs could benefit more from future rate cuts, their variable nature introduces budgeting uncertainty. Home equity loans offer stability, though they may miss out on further rate reductions.

          <p>The Ryder Cup's first tee at Bethpage Black is expected to be a boisterous and intimidating environment for European players, with stands accommodating 5,000 partisan American fans. Unlike the claustrophobic setup in Rome, this year's stand is further back, but players still anticipate significant nerves. European captain Luke Donald's team is engaging in a "charm offensive" with fans during practice days, signing autographs and posing for selfies, hoping to temper the vitriol. However, American players and fans alike are eager for "absolute chaos" and a fiercely partisan atmosphere once the tournament officially begins.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is leading an unprecedented $850 billion infrastructure buildout for AI, partnering with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, totaling 17 gigawatts of capacity. This massive investment, equivalent to 17 nuclear plants, aims to meet soaring demand, with ChatGPT usage increasing tenfold in 18 months. Altman acknowledges concerns about market overheating and a potential bubble but insists the scale is necessary to maximize AI capabilities. He notes that electricity is the biggest bottleneck for AI, leading to his investments in nuclear energy. While critics point to a circular financing model and inflated market values for partners, Altman remains confident in AI's long-term societal value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has announced its first absolute target to cut emissions, aiming for a 7-10% reduction by 2035 from peak levels. President Xi Jinping made the pledge at the UN in New York, contrasting with the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under President Trump. Environmentalists express disappointment, stating the target falls short of what's needed to meet global 1.5C warming goals, with many scenarios requiring over 50% reduction. Despite this, China has a track record of exceeding renewable energy commitments, and its rapid clean tech growth suggests it may surpass this target.</p>

While such promotions are not new, they aim to make vehicles more affordable and reduce inventory, though they carry increased risk of default during economic downturns. Ford Credit states it finances only creditworthy customers, using its own scoring model beyond FICO. This comes as new auto loan rates remain high, despite a recent Fed rate cut.
