          <p>The British government is set to announce a significant climbdown on its proposed welfare reforms following a rebellion from over 100 Labour Party backbenchers. To avoid a potential defeat in Parliament, the government is expected to agree that existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not see their benefits reduced. This concession addresses major concerns from MPs who criticized the plan to tighten eligibility for disability and sickness benefits, which was originally intended to save ¬£5 billion annually.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has officially announced his campaign for a third term, positioning himself as a problem-solver in contrast to the Trump administration. In his announcement, Pritzker highlighted his administration's achievements, including seven consecutive balanced budgets, nine state credit upgrades, and the passage of progressive legislation on minimum wage, marijuana legalization, and assault weapons. He also outlined future goals, such as restructuring education for the AI era and making housing and healthcare more affordable, while declining to comment on a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>Nike's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings revealed a significant financial downturn, with sales dropping 12% and net income falling by 86%. The company attributed the poor results to its ongoing turnaround strategy, which involves using discounts to clear out old inventory and shifting back toward wholesale channels. Despite the steep declines, Nike's leadership expressed confidence that this quarter represents the low point of its restructuring, stating that headwinds are expected to moderate and the business will be in a healthier long-term position.

          <p>With average credit card debt rising, this article advises those considering debt forgiveness programs to proceed with caution. Before applying, individuals should first determine if they truly need such a drastic measure, as it can damage credit scores and have tax implications. It is recommended to explore all alternatives, such as debt management plans or consolidation loans, which may be more suitable. Finally, if forgiveness is the chosen path, consumers should carefully shop around for legitimate and cost-effective servicers to avoid predatory schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of backup generator maker Generac are poised for their best week since last November, driven by increased investor demand. This surge is attributed to recent oppressive heat waves across the U.S. that have caused power outages and strained the nation's aging electrical grid. Furthermore, forecasts for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season are also boosting the company's outlook, as consumers and businesses seek to secure reliable backup power sources in anticipation of severe weather events and potential grid failures.

          <p>The sequel "M3GAN 2.0" largely abandons the horror elements of its predecessor in favor of a bigger, goofier action-comedy approach, according to this review. The film sees the artificially intelligent doll reconstructed to face off against a new, military-grade android, AMELIA. While the plot is seen as derivative of films like "The Terminator," the review praises director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor and its exploration of the blending of biological and synthetic beings. The movie is described as a fun, if forgettable, summer amusement.</p>
