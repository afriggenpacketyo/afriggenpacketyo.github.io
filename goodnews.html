          <p>Key inflation readings and Treasury auctions are set to challenge the bond market this week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release consumer and producer price reports for May, with economists anticipating modest increases. Any unexpected surge in inflation could unsettle investors concerned about inflationary pressures stemming from tariffs. The Treasury Department will also sell $39 billion in 10-year notes and $22 billion in 30-year bonds, providing insights into investor demand for Treasurys amidst rising debt and deficits. These factors combined could significantly impact the economy and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help these birds, can become deadly if not properly maintained. Sugar water left out too long can spoil and grow harmful microbes, leading to infections in hummingbirds. A common infection is candida, which causes swollen tongues and starvation. To prevent this, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days with hot water, or more frequently in hot weather, using a mixture of vinegar and water. Planting native wildflowers is also a good way to support local hummingbird populations.</p>

This could diversify BlackRock's revenue and earnings, reducing reliance on volatile stock and bond markets.
