          <p>The United States and Iran convened in Muscat, Oman, for a fourth round of negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program, mediated by Omani officials, as both nations aim to resolve their long-standing dispute through diplomacy. While both sides expressed a desire to reach an agreement where Iran limits its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of U.S. sanctions, significant disagreements persist on critical issues, including the extent of dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities, which the Trump administration advocates for, but Iran rejects. The negotiations occur as President Trump prepares for a Middle East visit and has threatened military action if diplomacy fails, raising the stakes for regional and global security. The article highlights the potential for reshaping the region's security landscape through a deal, while also acknowledging the deep distrust and challenges that remain. Optimism is cautiously expressed by both sides, but technical level discussions remain challenging.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expressed optimism regarding reforms to the Federal Aviation Administration, stating that there is bipartisan and bicameral commitment to overhauling the system, as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has called for increased investment amid major outages and delays at Newark Liberty International Airport.

Despite recent air traffic control outages at Newark, Kirby reassured the public that the aviation industry has extensive training and backup procedures to ensure safety, though these outages can cause disruptions and delays for customers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Mexico are nearing a deal to permanently end the sewage crisis affecting San Diego's coastal waters, according to EPA chief Lee Zeldin, who announced that the EPA transmitted a proposed '100% solution' to Mexico.

          <p>A group of Quakers are marching from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, extending a long tradition of Quaker activism. The march seeks to show solidarity with migrants and other groups targeted by Trump's policies, with organizers expressing a commitment to justice and peace. The Quakers aim to deliver a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document calling for religious freedom, to the US Capitol, as a reminder to uphold the principle that all are welcome.</p>

          <p>The UK will end care worker recruitment from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who stated that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws to cut net migration, expecting to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure.</p>
