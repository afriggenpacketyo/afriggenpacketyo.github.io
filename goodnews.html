        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, while appealing for older homeowners to access home equity without monthly payments, are complex and come with pitfalls that can affect borrowers and their heirs. This article advises against ignoring true costs like origination fees and ongoing property taxes, and emphasizes discussing the loan's impact on heirs, who will need to repay or refinance upon the borrower's death or move. It also cautions against borrowing more than necessary, as this increases interest accrual, and warns that proceeds can affect eligibility for means-tested benefits like Medicaid. Seeking independent professional guidance beyond a lender's pitch is crucial for informed decision-making (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street is experiencing an undeniable rebound in dealmaking, signaling a bullish outlook for Goldman Sachs' crucial investment banking division. The article highlights two key developments: Goldman Sachs' significant role as a financial advisor in the massive $55 billion Electronic Arts leveraged buyout, and Jefferies' reported record third-quarter advisory revenue, both indicating a stronger dealmaking environment. After a period of high interest rates and regulatory headwinds, expectations for a more relaxed business approach under the Trump administration are materializing. This resurgence in M&A and IPO activity is expected to significantly boost Goldman's investment banking revenue and overall performance, positioning the firm at the top of M&A advisors for eight consecutive years (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California startup Aetherflux is developing innovative space-based solar farms that use infrared lasers to wirelessly transmit collected solar power from low-orbit satellites to small ground stations on Earth. Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt, the company's CEO, explains that this constellation approach allows for distributed power generation and smaller ground collection spots, enhancing efficiency. Aetherflux is initially partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense to address the critical need for battlefield power, a strategy backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures to scale the technology. The challenge now lies in making this advanced technology cost-competitive with existing energy sources.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has ordered the removal of his country's Beijing embassy diplomats, accusing them of sabotaging relations with China and displaying a "colonialism" mindset. Petro claimed these diplomats altered his schedule and canceled meetings without authorization during his spring visit to China, impeding his diplomatic efforts. This purge follows Colombia's formal accession to China’s Belt and Road Initiative in May, marking a significant pivot away from decades of deference to Washington and towards deeper engagement with Beijing. The decision, described by Colombia's foreign ministry as a "historic step," is expected to unlock substantial investment, technology transfers, and major construction projects.</p>

          <p>The federal government plans to begin processing initial applications for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) for the first time in four years, following a Justice Department proposal. This move would reopen DACA to first-time applicants in all states except Texas, where existing DACA recipients would retain deportation protection but lose employment authorization. The proposal is a response to an ongoing lawsuit and could allow Texas DACA recipients to regain work permits by moving out of state. Advocacy groups like United We Dream highlight the ongoing uncertainty and emotional toll on recipients, urging renewals while expressing concerns about the program's long-term future.</p>

Felipe Colon, who served 21 years for manslaughter, is among those volunteering, seeing the church's restoration as a powerful metaphor for personal reform and societal acceptance. Pastor Jamie Owens expressed inspiration at the sight of diverse volunteers working on the project, which includes meticulously reupholstering balcony chairs that haven't been replaced since the 1890s. This community effort, expected to finish in October, symbolizes the ability for individuals to reform and contribute positively, making the sanctuary welcoming once again.</p>
