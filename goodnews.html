          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's stock experienced a significant surge despite the company's decision to slash its profit outlook due to anticipated tariff impacts. The retailer now expects full-year earnings per share to fall between $9.50 and $10.50, a decrease from the previous range of $10.40 to $11.40, due to tariffs, which are expected to negatively impact the business by $50 million. Despite the revised guidance, the company reported fiscal first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to the initial stock increase. Abercrombie is working to diversify its sourcing network and reduce expenses to mitigate the tariff impact without implementing broad price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials responsible for censoring protected expression in the United States. The policy targets those who issue or threaten arrest warrants against U.S. citizens or residents for social media posts and those who demand American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies. Rubio emphasized that free speech is essential to the American way of life and that foreign governments have no authority over it. The exact implementation of this policy remains to be seen, but it appears to be directed at countries with a history of targeting individuals for criticizing their governments online.</p>

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger is retiring after leading the department through a period of rebuilding following the January 6th Capitol riot. Manger successfully advocated for increased funding to improve hiring, equipment, and operations, addressing intelligence and communication failures that contributed to the security breach. Manger has been critical of the pardons issued by President Trump to free Capitol rioters, calling it "probably one of my worst days in this job." He also condemned conspiracy theories about the events of January 6th, emphasizing the real experiences of officers who were assaulted and injured.</p>

          <p>A judge ruled that a lawsuit alleging Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency are illegally wielding power over federal government operations can move forward. The lawsuit, filed by several Democratic state attorneys general, claims Trump violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution by giving Musk and DOGE sweeping authority to carry out mass firings, terminate grants and contracts, and access sensitive government data without congressional approval. The ruling highlights conflicting descriptions of the power Musk and DOGE have been given, and how efforts to downplay that power have been undermined by public statements and actions. Musk has promised to step back from his government work to focus on his other businesses.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only as one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its structure, with existing shareholders selling a larger portion of shares than the company itself. In Circle's updated prospectus, the company said it would sell 9.6 million shares in the offering, while existing shareholders would sell 14.4 million shares, which is similar to Facebook's 2012 IPO. This high level of insider sales may reflect a need for liquidity among venture capital firms following a period of meager returns. (not investment advice)</p>

Torigian argues that Xi Zhongxun's life provides insight into the nature of the Chinese Communist Party and its evolution throughout the 20th century.

          <p>The movie *Friendship* traces how Craig Waterman, played by Tim Robinson, and his neighbor Austin, played by Paul Rudd, quickly bond and then break apart. The film examines the absurdity of modern male-bonding rituals and the lengths a person will go to in order to get someone else, especially a new friend, to like them. The film often plays like a horror movie and has a nuanced performance that makes *Friendship* somewhat compassionate as a study of how exhausting social mores can be to grasp. The film fearlessly reckons with how confounding people can be in their bid for one another‚Äôs approval.</p>
