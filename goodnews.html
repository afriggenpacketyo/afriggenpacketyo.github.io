          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration over its decision to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. The university argues that the ban violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claims Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment. Harvard President Alan Gerber countered that the university did respond to the Department of Homeland Security's requests as required by law, accusing the administration of retaliatory action against the university for supporting policies it dislikes.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are reconsidering earlier claims of detecting potential signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located over 120 light-years away. While initial data suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a gas solely produced by life on Earth, three independent analyses have since challenged this finding. These analyses, utilizing data from the James Webb Space Telescope, indicate strong signals of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane but lack clear evidence of dimethyl sulfide. Researchers suggest that faint noise in the mid-infrared light could be misleading, with other molecules like propyne potentially responsible for the observed signals.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee stated that President Trump's recent tariff threats have complicated monetary policy, likely delaying any changes to interest rates. Goolsbee indicated that the Fed will likely remain on hold while evaluating the impact of the ever-changing trade policy on inflation and employment. He expressed concern that tariffs could have a stagflationary impact, creating a challenging situation for the central bank. Goolsbee emphasized the need for clarity on trade policy before making any moves, while still maintaining optimism about longer-term economic growth.</p>

          <p>Scientists discovered that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heat waves, according to research published in Science Advances. During a heat wave in Papua New Guinea, researchers measured clownfish and found that they got shorter by a few millimeters over several weeks. The study suggests that shrinking may be an adaptation to help clownfish survive hotter ocean temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, indicating that being small has advantages in a hot climate.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine have carried out a significant prisoner exchange, although details remain scarce and officials indicate the swap is ongoing. The exchange, agreed upon in recent peace talks in Turkey, involves approximately 1,000 prisoners from each side. While the specifics of the swap are unconfirmed, this development is seen as a positive step towards de-escalation and potential future negotiations. Both Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported in recent days that a swap had been agreed for about 1,000 prisoners to be handed over by each side, but those overall figures were not confirmed by either government on Friday.</p>
