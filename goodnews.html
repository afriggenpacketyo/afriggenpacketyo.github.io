          <p>Google has announced an agreement to hire Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, includes licensing fees and compensation but is not a full acquisition, allowing Windsurf to continue operating and license its technology elsewhere. This move intensifies the ongoing talent war in the artificial intelligence sector, following similar high-profile hires by competitors like Meta and Microsoft. Windsurf has gained popularity for its innovative AI-assisted coding tools.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to cease indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests across seven counties in Southern California. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups that presented a "mountain of evidence" suggesting federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on their race or ethnicity. The temporary order prohibits agents from using factors like apparent race, speaking Spanish, or being present at certain locations as the sole basis for a stop. The administration denied the allegations, stating enforcement is targeted.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to collaborate with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a backlash over sandals it showcased that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The move came after Indian fashion critics and craftspeople criticized the brand for not acknowledging the design's cultural origins. Prada met with a chamber of commerce representing thousands of Kolhapuri artisans to discuss a potential partnership. This initiative is being viewed as a potential model for respectful collaboration between global fashion brands and traditional communities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt federal immigration raids in Los Angeles and several other California counties. The ruling sided with a civil rights lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argued that federal agents were violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by conducting stops without reasonable suspicion and denying detainees access to counsel. The judge's order specified that agents cannot rely solely on factors like race, language, or location to initiate a stop. Local officials praised the decision as a defense of constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permitted a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. to move forward on several key claims. While the judge dismissed the idea that a voice itself can be copyrighted, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings as training data will proceed. The artists allege they were hired for internal projects, only to later discover AI-generated clones of their voices being sold on Lovo's platform for commercial use.</p>

          <p>Driven by growing demand from Chinese companies operating overseas and encouragement from Beijing, Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their international footprint. As of last year, there were 208 Chinese legal offices established abroad, a 70 percent increase since 2018. Lawyers state that Chinese companies often prefer and have more trust in legal support from their compatriots. However, they face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions, marking a pivotal moment for the industry's global ambitions.</p>

          <p>A major terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in port activity linked to rising tariffs and global trade instability. The project will increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% by extending the quay to accommodate larger ships. Although container movement has recently dropped, port officials expressed confidence in the long-term demand and the need for infrastructure investment. The expansion is seen as a crucial step to strengthen the American supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature world number one Iga Swiatek against the resurgent Amanda Anisimova in their first-ever tour-level match. Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam champion, has historically found grass to be her most challenging surface, while Anisimova is reaching her first major final after a break for mental health. The analysis in this article suggests the outcome will depend on who better manages the pressure of the occasion. Anisimova's underdog status may allow her to play more freely against the highly experienced but less comfortable Swiatek.</p>

This "Australia first" doctrine comes as the nation grapples with the strategic implications of the AUKUS security pact and rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
