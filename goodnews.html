          <p>A Lending Tree study reveals nearly 6 million U.S. full-time workers earned over $100,000 in 2023 without a four-year college degree, challenging traditional career paths. Occupations like software development, sales engineering, and elevator repair were among 20 fields where at least 40% of non-graduates achieved six-figure salaries. This trend reflects a growing skepticism about the value and cost of higher education, with some companies loosening degree requirements. The article highlights that starting one's own business also offers a significant avenue for high earnings without a college diploma.</p>

          <p>The NFL has relaxed some restrictions on Tom Brady, allowing him more flexibility in his second year as a Fox analyst while holding a minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. Previously, Brady was prohibited from attending production meetings with coaches and players, but this rule has been lifted, permitting remote participation. He can also interview players off-site. The league maintains a restriction against "egregiously criticizing officials." These adjustments follow the approval of Brady's 10% stake in the Raiders last October, balancing his broadcasting duties with his team ownership.</p>

It remains unclear if prosecutors will pursue misdemeanor charges or attempt another indictment, as the grand jury declined to proceed with the felony charge.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper has withdrawn from the US Open ahead of his second-round match, citing persistent discomfort from an arm injury. The 23-year-old had been struggling with a bruised humerus since April, which worsened during the grass-court season, forcing him to miss key tournaments. Despite winning his first-round match, the pain became too much, leading to his difficult decision to prioritize his health. This withdrawal will likely impact his ranking and future ATP Finals chances, as he faces another extended break to recover from the bone injury.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited Moldova, affirming strong support for its EU membership bid. They urged Moldovans to remain firmly anchored with the West, warning against Russian attempts to undermine its freedom and influence upcoming parliamentary elections. Moldovan President Maia Sandu emphasized that "without the EU, Moldova remains blocked in the past," citing Russia's war in Ukraine as daily proof that Europe means peace. Despite progress, Moldova's EU path faces a "Hungary-sized roadblock" due to Budapest's veto on Ukraine's accession, which impacts Moldova's synchronized bid.</p>

          <p>The maximum Social Security benefit in 2025 varies significantly by retirement age, reaching $5,108 per month for those retiring at age 70. Achieving this maximum requires exceptional lifetime earnings, consistently meeting or exceeding the taxable maximum for at least 35 years. Most retirees receive far less, with Social Security often being their primary income source. The article advises exploring additional income streams like reverse mortgages, annuities, part-time work, or investment portfolios to ensure financial security in retirement, as Social Security alone may be insufficient for desired lifestyles.

          <p>Google has cut over a third of its managers overseeing small teams in the past year, as part of a broader strategy to increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy across the organization. This 35% reduction primarily affected managers with fewer than three direct reports, with many transitioning to individual contributor roles. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated the company's need to scale without constantly increasing headcount. The move follows several rounds of layoffs and buyouts, which have impacted employee morale despite the company's strong financial performance. Executives indicated that voluntary exit programs have been "quite successful."</p>
