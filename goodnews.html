          <p>Japan's ambassador to China, Kenji Kanasugi, emphasized the need for China and Japan to improve public opinion towards each other, particularly amid concerns about tariffs imposed by the U.S. Ambassador Kanasugi highlighted lingering negative perceptions in both countries and the challenges in quickly remedying the situation, urging steady progress through addressing concrete challenges and promoting practical cooperation. He also noted that tourism between the two countries has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with some Japanese citizens feeling anxious about visiting China due to various reasons. The ambassador stated that Japan continues to raise these issues with the Chinese government, as relations remain complicated by historical issues, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood. </p>

          <p>Nintendo sold over 3.5 million units of its Switch 2 gaming system in the four days following its launch, causing major U.S. retailers to display "out of stock" signs. This record-breaking start, the company's first new console in eight years, puts Nintendo on track to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Analysts predict that initial demand will remain strong, with some forecasting over 20 million units sold in the first 12 months. The Switch 2, released on June 5, has been met with enthusiasm, and Nintendo of America's president expressed gratitude for the positive response. </p>

          <p>Asia's move away from the U.S. dollar is gaining momentum due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with countries seeking to reduce reliance on the greenback. The U.S. dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves has declined, and its use as leverage in trade negotiations has prompted a reevaluation of portfolios. ASEAN is promoting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while BRICS nations are developing their own payment systems to bypass traditional systems. Asian economies with large foreign assets, such as Singapore, South Korea, and China, have the greatest potential to repatriate earnings to their home currencies. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Zara owner Inditex reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and flagged a slower start to the summer season due to broader economic uncertainty. Revenues for the fiscal first quarter were 8.27 billion euros, slightly below the forecast of 8.39 billion euros, while net income was 1.3 billion euros, compared to the estimated 1.32 billion euros. Summer sales increased 6% at constant currencies from May 1 to June 9, versus 12% growth in the same period last year.

          <p>The Chancellor's Spending Review promises increased spending for Scotland on defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. The Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde will receive ¬£250 million, Edinburgh will host the most powerful supercomputer in the UK with ¬£750 million, and the Acorn Project in St Fergus will receive funding. The review allocates day-to-day spending for the next three years and capital spending for four years. The Westminster government is prioritizing economic growth, with an emphasis on spreading funds around the UK. </p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star, struck out six in three simulated innings, marking progress in his pitching comeback from right elbow surgery in September 2023. Ohtani faced minor-league batters during a 44-pitch outing, with his fastest pitch clocked at 96 miles per hour. Manager Dave Roberts indicated there is a chance Ohtani could return as a pitcher before the All-Star break. Dodgers pitching coach Mark Prior praised Ohtani's command and ability to use all his pitches. </p>
