          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has been advocating for Alaska LNG as a national priority, envisioning an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes that securing commercial offtakers will facilitate financing, suggesting that countries seeking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. could invest in American energy. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mentioned that the Department of Defense is prepared to support the project by signing an offtake agreement to supply gas to strategic bases in Alaska.

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election, with polls now open, to elect a new leader after months of political turmoil. The two frontrunners are Lee Jae-myung from the liberal Democratic Party and Kim Moon Soo from the conservative People Power Party. Lee Jae-myung, a former mayor and governor, is leading in opinion surveys, despite facing ongoing legal cases and investigations for corruption. Kim Moon Soo, who previously served as a governor and member of the National Assembly, is trailing in the polls and has sought to distance himself from ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>

          <p>Due to rising tariffs, a restaurant in Beijing has been forced to remove American salt-baked chicken feet from its menu and substitute Australian beef in its "Great American" burger. The owner of Kunyuan restaurant noted that the price of American chicken feet had increased by 30% since March. While the owner can source chicken feet from Brazil or Russia, he believes that they don't compare to the American variety. He hopes to serve American chicken feet again once prices decrease.</p>

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs, establishing a fixed price for delivering water supplies. The agreement aims to foster greater collaboration between the agencies, improve their finances, and facilitate water movement where needed. The dispute centered on the price the Water Authority pays MWD for an exchange of water, specifically supplies secured from the Colorado River. Under the settlement, the Water Authority will pay a fixed price to MWD for delivering these supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, with annual adjustments for inflation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) outposts in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The decision came after lawmakers argued that closing the offices would negatively impact the USDA‚Äôs ability to support farmers, essential to California‚Äôs agricultural success. The closures were initially part of a broader effort led by the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut costs across government agencies. The USDA offices provide farmers with access to loans, grants, technical assistance, and in-person meetings with USDA staff.</p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which is expected to alleviate congestion at the airport. The temporary closure of runway 4L-22R had left only two other runways operational, prompting the FAA to set limits on flight arrivals and departures. The Port Authority accelerated the construction schedule by hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors to expedite timelines. The runway was milled and paved, and outfitted with updated lighting and airfield signs, with further closures expected on weeknights and weekends to fully complete the project by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Senators are intensifying calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill to move forward, with Senator Lindsey Graham claiming the Senate will address legislation this week that would impose strict tariffs on Moscow. The bill proposes a 500% tariff on any country that buys Moscow's energy products, aiming to cripple Russia's war machine. Senator Graham coordinated with the White House on the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025," which has bipartisan support and aims to isolate Russia economically.
