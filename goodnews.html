          <p>The art world is celebrating the legacy of sculptor Louise Nevelson, known for her massive, monochromatic sculptures often created from found wooden objects. Though she declared her artistic intentions at age nine, it took decades for her to gain recognition, with her first retrospective held at the Whitney Museum in 1967. Her granddaughter, Maria Nevelson, recalls the artist's unconventional nature and her habit of 'dumpster diving' for materials on the streets of New York. Nevelson's work, which transformed humble materials into monumental art, is currently on display at both the Whitney in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art.</p>

          <p>On the second day of his visit to Scotland, President Donald Trump played another round of golf at his Turnberry resort amid a significant police presence. His main official business for the day is a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss transatlantic trade relations. Trump has indicated a "50-50" chance of reaching a framework for a deal, which he is expected to discuss further with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney in the coming days. The visit has drawn both small groups of supporters and larger anti-Trump protests in other Scottish cities.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company a year ago. The manufacturer's stock is up over 30% this year, aircraft production has increased, and deliveries have hit an 18-month high. Ortberg has implemented significant cost cuts, raised capital, and is credited with improving the company culture, earning praise from airline executives who were previously critical. While challenges remain, including FAA production caps and issues in its defense unit, analysts are increasingly optimistic about Boeing's path to profitability.</p>

          <p>In his column, former rugby player Matt Dawson asserts that for the current British and Irish Lions team to achieve legendary status, they must secure a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While celebrating the series win, Dawson contends that a clean sweep, a feat not accomplished on a major tour in nearly a century, would cement their legacy for decades. He contrasts the current squad's mindset with his own 1997 series-winning team, noting that today's players are openly discussing the 3-0 goal. Dawson suggests that a few strategic team changes could freshen up the squad for the final Test in Sydney.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to extreme heat and drought in northern Guatemala, environmental groups have installed large, regularly refilled tubs of water in nature reserves to help wildlife survive. Motion-activated cameras, or "thirst traps," set up nearby have captured incredible footage of a wide array of animals using these artificial oases. The videos show rare species like jaguars and tapirs drinking and cooling off, providing valuable insights into animal behavior. This initiative serves as a vital, albeit temporary, tool to help wildlife adapt to the increasing challenges of climate change.</p>
