          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new role leading the "Doge team," modeled after President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf had cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time" when he initially quit. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will now take on a more public-facing role, making more frequent media appearances for the party. This move suggests a strategic shift in Reform UK's approach to public engagement and policy implementation.</p>

Robinson accused the restaurant of "discriminatory behavior" based on his political beliefs, and Tripadvisor has temporarily suspended reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants due to an influx of reviews "that do not describe a first-hand experience".</p>

Oatmeal is rich in fiber, minerals, and vitamins, including beta-glucan, which can help maintain healthy cholesterol and blood glucose levels. It is advised to avoid instant oatmeal due to its processed nature and added sugars, and Dr. Freeman also recommends limiting eggs due to their cholesterol content.</p>
