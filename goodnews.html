        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have agreed to a framework deal regarding the ownership of TikTok, with a final agreement pending a call between Presidents Trump and Xi. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the development, suggesting a move toward U.S.-controlled ownership for the popular social media app. This follows a 2024 law, upheld by the Supreme Court, that mandated TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, either divest its U.S. operations or face a ban, a measure President Trump had repeatedly delayed. The agreement aims to resolve national security concerns while allowing the app to continue operating in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued on Truth Social that this shift would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea echoes previous suggestions by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the short-term focus prompted by quarterly guidance. Current regulations mandate quarterly reports, a system praised for its transparency, while practices in Europe often require only semiannual reporting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, partly driven by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties. Despite facing increased competition from AI startups and regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. This milestone reflects investor confidence in the company's ability to navigate challenges, including leveraging its Gemini AI models for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and other challenges, there are signs that younger Europeans are once again looking to China for career and entrepreneurial opportunities. The article suggests a generational divide in perception, with younger individuals being more drawn to the country's rapid growth and dynamic tech hubs like Shenzhen and Shanghai. This rekindled interest comes after an exodus of foreigners during China's stringent COVID-19 restrictions. For many, China represents a place of significant potential for professional development and being part of a fast-changing economic system.</p>

          <p>A psychology expert advises against using generic conversation starters like "How are you?" to build genuine connections, as they often lead to scripted, unmemorable interactions. Instead, the article suggests asking more engaging questions that prompt people to share positive experiences, such as "What's the highlight of your week so far?". The expert also emphasizes the importance of body language, like maintaining an open stance and mirroring others' gestures, to signal trustworthiness. Practicing these techniques in low-stakes daily interactions can help make them feel more natural and effective in building rapport.</p>

          <p>Following weeks of violent anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. The 73-year-old is known for her integrity and anti-corruption stance, making her a favored choice among the Gen Z-led protest groups. Her appointment is seen as a reflection of growing trust in women's leadership in a country that has seen patriarchal structures erode in recent years. Karki's immediate challenges include overseeing the rebuilding of government structures and ensuring fresh elections are held in March 2026.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers on how to strategically navigate the changing market. They recommend getting a freshly updated pre-approval to reflect increased buying power and acting promptly as lower rates often trigger a surge in competition. Experts also stress the importance of comparing offers from multiple lenders and locking in a favorable rate quickly. However, they caution against overextending budgets based on new pre-approval amounts and assuming that rates will continue to fall, as timing the market can often backfire.

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 21% of Americans believe it will take a "miracle" for them to retire securely, citing concerns about insufficient savings, inflation, and potential cuts to government benefits. However, financial experts argue that what most people need is not a miracle, but a concrete financial plan. Creating a plan helps clarify retirement goals, determine savings rates, and make informed investment decisions, providing a sense of security and control. Experts advise starting early, staying consistent, and seeking help from financial advisors or planning tools to navigate the complexities of long-term saving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While AI tools are increasingly popular for job applications, career experts warn that over-reliance on them could ruin a candidate's chances. Recruiters report that AI-generated resumes and cover letters often sound generic, contain "word salad" from keyword stuffing, or even include fabricated information. A common mistake is when AI tools, asked to tailor a resume, exaggerate or invent experience, leaving candidates unable to speak to their own qualifications in an interview. Experts advise using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial creation and stress the importance of thorough proofreading to avoid embarrassing errors.</p>

The article details how City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever positioning to create a midfield overload and pull United's defenders out of position. By "pinning" United's wing-back wide, City's winger Jeremy Doku was free to move inside, creating confusion and space. This disjointed United's press and allowed City players like Phil Foden time on the ball, directly leading to the opening goal and setting the tone for a dominant performance.</p>
