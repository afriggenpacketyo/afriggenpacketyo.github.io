        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the renewed diplomatic focus on the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral forum amid shifting global geopolitics. For Russia, facing Western isolation over the Ukraine war, reviving RIC offers a platform to demonstrate non-Western solidarity, reaffirm its Eurasian influence, and balance its growing dependency on China. While Beijing supports the initiative to stabilize its continental flank, New Delhi remains cautious, balancing its strategic autonomy with the potential benefits of regional cooperation. The piece questions whether this renewed interest is a genuine strategic alignment or merely a pragmatic response to current international pressures.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and strong business performance, which caused its stock to rise. The pharmaceutical giant's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by sales from its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. The updated outlook accounts for a significant one-time charge related to a licensing deal with a Chinese drugmaker for a cancer treatment. The company's forecast also considers potential impacts from the Trump administration's calls for lower drug prices and tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article highlights Bangladesh's remarkable public health achievements over the past decades, including significant increases in life expectancy and reductions in mortality rates despite low GDP spending on health. It expresses concern that the recent political transition, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, could jeopardize this progress. The author urges global health organizations like the WHO and UNICEF to provide urgent support to the new interim government to preserve these gains. The piece emphasizes the need for international cooperation to help Bangladesh navigate challenges like the 'double burden' of infectious and non-communicable diseases and ensure continued investment in its health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, in a deal that could be worth up to £73.8 million. The offer is said to include a guaranteed payment of £65.2 million, with the remainder in potential add-ons. While RB Leipzig has not yet responded, Manchester United believes the valuation is fair and that the Slovenian international is interested in a move to the club. The article notes that Newcastle has also shown interest and submitted a bid for the player, which was not accepted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that the field of potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair has been narrowed to four individuals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, previously considered a top contender, has reportedly taken himself out of the running, preferring to remain in his current role. This development comes after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a new member to the Fed's board. Among the likely remaining candidates are former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, both of whom have advocated for lower interest rates.

          <h2>An Analysis of Sydney Sweeney's Controversial and Successful Commercial Ventures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 08:13:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article examines the public and media reactions to actress Sydney Sweeney's numerous, and often controversial, brand partnerships, from luxury fashion to a recent American Eagle campaign. The author argues that the outrage directed at Sweeney for her commercial success and seemingly unashamed self-promotion is misplaced and often gendered. The piece suggests that Sweeney is skillfully navigating modern celebrity by being unapologetically commercial and embracing a larger-than-life persona, which is what audiences traditionally desire from movie stars. The author frames Sweeney's approach as a masterclass in showbiz, contrasting it with the performative and often ineffective activism of her online critics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" on its 100th anniversary, arguing its most enduring theme is its profound exploration of the midlife crisis. The author notes that Woolf herself was 40 when she began the novel, a period she saw as a time to take stock of one's life. The narrative follows its 51-year-old protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway, through a single day as she contemplates her past choices, her present existence, and her future, embodying the formlessness and transformative nature of middle age. The piece concludes that the novel is a testament to finding joy and meaning in the present moment, a victory of life over the ever-present shadow of death.</p>

          <p>This article examines India's recent and rapid rise to prominence in the world of competitive chess, a shift from decades of Russian and European dominance. It highlights the success of young Indian players, such as 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh, who recently won the FIDE Women's World Cup, and 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju, the youngest-ever world champion. The piece attributes this success to a combination of factors, including a strong grassroots coaching culture, particularly in the city of Chennai, supportive parents who see chess as an academic pursuit, and increased financial viability for a career in the sport. The global resurgence of chess, amplified by the pandemic and online platforms, has also benefited India's growing talent pool.</p>

          <h2>BP to Review Oil and Gas Projects Following Major Discovery in Brazil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 07:50:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy giant BP has announced it will conduct a thorough review of its oil and gas assets to boost profitability and shareholder returns, continuing its strategic shift back toward fossil fuels. This pledge follows the company's largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years, located in deep water off the coast of Brazil, which could become a major production hub. Under pressure from investors for underperforming rivals, CEO Murray Auchincloss stated that BP "can and will do better," initiating a new cost review alongside the asset evaluation. This move reinforces BP's recent decision to scale back investments in renewables in favor of its core oil and gas operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>NASA Accelerates Plans to Build a Nuclear Reactor on the Moon by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 07:36:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA is reportedly fast-tracking plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 to support a permanent human settlement and a future lunar economy. According to media reports, the agency's acting head cited similar plans by China and Russia as a reason for the urgency, expressing concern those nations could declare exclusive zones on the lunar surface. The move has surprised some scientists, given recent NASA budget cuts, and raised concerns that the timeline is driven more by geopolitical competition than scientific goals. Experts agree nuclear power is likely the most viable option for continuous energy on the Moon, where two-week periods of darkness make solar power challenging.</p>
