          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train from Vienna to Hamburg were stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours due to a power failure. The outage disabled the air conditioning and lighting, creating a hot and dark environment for those aboard. The evacuation was prolonged when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel, forcing a power shutdown for safety reasons. Ultimately, all passengers were safely evacuated by bus back to Vienna, with two receiving on-site medical treatment but no hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals have officially signed first-round draft pick Shemar Stewart, ending a contentious months-long contract dispute. Stewart, a defensive end from Texas A&M, had held out over disagreements regarding the structure of future guarantees in his rookie deal. The conflict involved public statements from both the player and team executives, with Stewart not participating in training camp. The newly signed contract is a fully guaranteed $18.97 million deal, making him the final 2025 first-round pick to sign.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8, bound for Miami, was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport after a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely deplaned and transported back to the terminal. The airline later confirmed a maintenance issue with a tire, and the fire department extinguished a related fire. While operations were temporarily disrupted with a ground stop, the airport has since returned to normal, and passengers will continue on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief, as it avoids a potentially season-ending injury for the two-time AL MVP. Judge, who leads the majors in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days. He hopes to return initially as a designated hitter once the strain has healed.</p>

          <p>The early 2000s reality show "The Osbournes" pioneered the "reality sitcom" genre, transforming Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne from a heavy metal icon into a beloved, bumbling television father. The MTV series, which ran from 2002 to 2005, blended the family's rock-and-roll lifestyle with mundane domestic life, capturing a massive audience before the era of the Kardashians. Producers and critics note that the show's success stemmed from its authentic portrayal of a chaotic but loving family, setting a new precedent for celebrity-driven reality TV.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the emotional intensity of the Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the physiological reasons behind fans' stress, such as increased adrenaline and cortisol levels. This "fight or flight" response, especially during high-stakes moments like penalty shootouts, can elevate heart rates and impact sleep. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, planning their day to maintain a sense of control, and eating well. They also suggest reframing the nervous energy as part of the enjoyable, communal experience of supporting a team in a major tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface, cooling the air. This has resulted in persistent gray, drizzly weather, contrasting sharply with the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, climatologists warn that the region's hottest months are often still to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to change licensing rules to offer greater protection to pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed reforms, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The changes also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in vacant shops and expanding outdoor service areas to help revitalize town centers. The move comes as many hospitality businesses face closure due to rising costs and legal challenges over noise.</p>
