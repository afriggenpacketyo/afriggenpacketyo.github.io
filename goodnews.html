          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, trading above $121,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of favorable U.S. legislation. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to begin deliberations on a series of crypto-focused bills, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' which aim to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. This legislative push, supported by President Donald Trump, has boosted investor confidence and fueled institutional buying. Analysts suggest that increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity are key factors behind the cryptocurrency's recent bullish performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing that it could be transformed into a mutual organization owned by its postmasters. This move aims to rebuild trust and reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which resulted in the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government stated it does not plan to reduce the current network of over 11,500 branches, it is seeking public input on the Post Office's ownership structure and future services, particularly in banking. The proposal is seen as a way to empower frontline workers and prevent similar scandals. </p>

          <p>Golden State Warriors guard Buddy Hield shared a humorous anecdote about his recent trip to the Colosseum in Rome. Speaking during an NBA Summer League broadcast, Hield admitted he was 'a little disappointed' upon learning from his tour guide that the character Maximus from the film 'Gladiator' was not a real historical figure. He explained that he had been enthusiastically calling out the character's name during his visit, inspired by the 2000 Oscar-winning movie. The lighthearted story provided a moment of amusement during the basketball game coverage, highlighting a funny intersection of sports, travel, and pop culture.</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, has grown his company, Ithaca Hummus, from a small farmers market operation into a major brand expected to generate over $50 million this year. After leaving the restaurant industry burnt out, Kirby enrolled at Cornell University and developed his business idea, starting with just a $450 blender and a few thousand dollars. He focused on a high-quality product and adopted a slow-growth strategy, prioritizing depth in existing markets over rapid expansion. Now sold in over 8,000 stores, Ithaca Hummus has achieved over $150 million in lifetime sales without taking on venture capital, maintaining Kirby's original vision.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached $3,357.20 per ounce as of July 11, 2025, reflecting its continued appeal as a safe-haven asset for investors during times of economic uncertainty. This article outlines the multiple factors influencing gold's value, including supply and demand dynamics, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The relationship between gold and interest rates is typically inverse; low rates make non-yielding gold more attractive. As a tangible asset, physical gold has historically maintained its value, making it a popular choice for those looking to hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has launched a public defense of its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project, directly countering criticisms from the Trump administration. After the Office of Management and Budget director attacked the project as an 'ostentatious overhaul,' the Fed posted a webpage explaining the necessity of the renovations for its historic buildings, which haven't been updated since the 1930s. The Fed clarified that the project is self-funded, not paid for by taxpayers, and refuted claims of new 'VIP dining rooms.' This public pushback marks a notable response from the central bank amid an escalating campaign of pressure from President Trump.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is renewing its effort to establish the region as a nuclear-weapon-free zone by urging global powers to sign its 1995 treaty. Following a recent diplomatic forum, Malaysia's foreign minister announced that China has committed to endorsing the treaty without reservation, and indicated that Russia may do so as well. The push comes as global powers, including the U.S., vie for influence in the region, and as some ASEAN states explore civilian nuclear energy programs. The move is seen by some analysts as a diplomatic win for Beijing, contrasting its position with the AUKUS security pact.</p>

The tournament also signaled that time may be catching up with 38-year-old Novak Djokovic, who fell short in his bid for a 25th major title.

The spread of Christianity introduced centuries of persecution, labeling such relationships as 'unnatural.'
