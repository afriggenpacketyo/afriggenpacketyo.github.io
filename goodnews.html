        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic that the budget bill, which faced committee setbacks, will reach the House floor before Memorial Day. Johnson emphasized the importance of this "historic" bill, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's July 4 deadline, and is working to ensure its swift passage through both the House and the Senate. The bill faced resistance from some Republicans concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending, but Johnson largely blamed potential delays in enforcing new eligibility requirements on states' abilities to implement changes in their systems. Johnson has been in regular contact with Senate Majority Leader John Thune to avoid surprises and ensure smooth passage.</p>

          <p>The Hawaiian tradition of lei making, introduced by early Polynesian settlers over 1,000 years ago, is an expression of aloha and a gesture of respect. Leis are given for various occasions, from weddings to funerals, and can use up to 300 individual flowers. However, the future of lei making is threatened by suburban sprawl, climate change, and the fact that 90% of flowers used are imported. Lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like wood beads, seeds, and shells to create "forever leis."</p>

Experts have warned that converting the jet into Air Force One could take years and cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
