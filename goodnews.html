          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew over two million attendees. Authorities arrested the alleged mastermind and a teenager, who were allegedly recruiting participants online to carry out attacks using improvised explosives to gain notoriety on social media. The suspects had been spreading hate speech and were also promoting the radicalization of teenagers. The city funded the concert to revitalize Rio's economy, deploying 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition for security. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Nicaragua has officially withdrawn from UNESCO after the organization awarded its annual press freedom prize to La Prensa, an exiled Nicaraguan newspaper. The Nicaraguan government accused La Prensa of promoting U.S. interventions after the newspaper's staff were forced to publish from abroad. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay expressed regret over Nicaragua's decision, emphasizing the organization's commitment to defending freedom of expression and the press.
