          <p>The four-person crew of NASA's Crew-10 mission has successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after a nearly five-month stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The team, comprising astronauts from the U.S., Japan, and Russia, conducted over 200 scientific experiments aimed at preparing for future human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. Their return via a SpaceX capsule marks another successful flight under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which has ended U.S. reliance on Russian spacecraft for astronaut transport. The mission's conclusion comes as NASA and its partners plan for the ISS's retirement by the end of the decade, hoping commercial stations will follow.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda-blasting loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows a similar move by South Korea, which recently dismantled its own speakers and halted anti-Pyongyang broadcasts as a goodwill gesture under its new liberal president, Lee Jae Myung. The psychological warfare, which involved the South playing K-pop and the North responding with irritating noises, had escalated tensions in recent months. While this de-escalation is a positive step, relations remain tense, with upcoming U.S.-South Korea military exercises likely to provoke a response from Pyongyang.</p>

          <p>A development team has invested over $104 million to convert the abandoned St. John's College campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, into a 205-unit luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic 19th-century property, which had been deteriorating for decades, was acquired through a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church. The project preserved original architectural elements while adding modern amenities and a new wing, creating a mix of market-rate and affordable housing units. The renovation aims to revitalize a neglected landmark, providing income for the church and new housing options that honor the neighborhood's historic fabric.</p>

Born in L.A. to a Honduran immigrant mother, Amaya founded the Cinco Estrellas ballet group to connect a new generation with their heritage, an art form she credits with helping her navigate a challenging childhood and build her own identity. Despite a successful modeling career with a major agency, she remains committed to her community, using her own funds to support the dance group. Her story illustrates how art can serve as a powerful tool for empowerment and cultural preservation for immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed to head the FBI by President Carter in 1978, he was widely credited with restoring the agency's integrity after a period of scandal and abuse of power. Later, President Reagan chose him to lead the CIA in 1987 to stabilize the agency following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his honesty and commitment to the rule of law, Webster was a respected public servant who skillfully navigated two of the nation's most critical institutions during turbulent times. His career was a testament to his troubleshooting abilities and non-partisan approach to leadership.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, is now suggesting that many retirees can safely withdraw more. In his new book, he argues that a more diversified portfolio, including assets like small-company stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, potentially around 4.7% or even higher for today's retirees. Bengen notes that factors like high inflation and early-retirement bear markets are the biggest threats to a portfolio's longevity. He emphasizes that his original rule was a conservative, worst-case scenario baseline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be explained by science and probability, not supernatural forces. He argues that the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the region means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is not unusual compared to any other heavily traveled area of the ocean. This view is supported by institutions like Lloyd's of London and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA further explains that environmental factors, such as the Gulf Stream's volatile weather and complex navigation, combined with human error, are sufficient to account for the incidents attributed to the phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins suggests that parents who are constantly on their phones may be hindering their children's path to success by modeling distracting behavior. Speaking at a panel, Robbins shared her personal experience of realizing her own phone overuse was being mirrored by her children, leading to a loss of connection and focus. She advises parents to be more mindful of their digital habits, such as not carrying their phone at all times and not sleeping with it, to set a better example. By shifting from scolding to curiosity about their kids' online activities, parents can foster better communication and help their children develop healthier relationships with technology.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer held a private meeting with President Donald Trump to argue that his administration's tariffs were harming the state's vital automotive industry. The Democratic governor's direct, private appeal to the Republican president represents a distinct strategy among state leaders trying to protect their interests while opposing his broader agenda. Whitmer reportedly used a slide deck to visually present her case that the import taxes could lead to job losses and economic damage in a key state. While Trump offered no specific commitments, the meeting highlights the complex dynamic between the White House and Democratic governors on critical economic issues.</p>

          <p>According to a new Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy in 2025, a decrease from last year's $2.5 million benchmark. However, this figure varies significantly by region, with residents in the West setting the bar highest at $3 million, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. Despite the lower national average, nearly two-thirds of respondents feel that achieving wealth is becoming harder due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The survey also found that many Americans define wealth more broadly, equating it with happiness, health, and relationships in addition to money.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new life by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, bowling alleys, and expanded Barnes & Noble stores. This strategic shift is transforming malls from pure retail centers into community hubs, driving a rebound in foot traffic as these new destinations attract their own constituencies who then cross-shop at remaining retailers. For example, a Dayton, Ohio, mall has seen a surge in visitors after a large church, Crossroads, converted a former Sears into its new home. This trend of repurposing large retail spaces for experiential and community-focused uses suggests a potential rebirth for the enclosed American mall.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teenager experienced debilitating symptoms like dizziness and severe headaches for months. When physical therapy and medication failed to provide relief, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed the true cause of his issues: a rare brain condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). An AVM is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that can cause symptoms and carries a risk of rupture. The teen successfully underwent surgery to remove the malformation and is now recovering, highlighting the importance of advanced diagnostic imaging for persistent post-concussion symptoms.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece remembers the crucial work of Sandra Grimes, the CIA analyst who died recently at age 79. In 1991, Grimes agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing, discovering they had been compromised and executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs was instrumental in identifying her colleague, Rick Ames, as the mole responsible for the catastrophic intelligence breach. By connecting Ames's meetings with a Soviet official to large cash deposits, she built the case that led to his 1994 arrest. Grimes's dedication was vital in stopping a spy who caused immense damage to U.S. national security.</p>
