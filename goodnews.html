          <h2>Cardiologist Identifies Five Common Foods He Avoids Giving His Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:36:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, regaining his championship title after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, securing a decisive victory over the 2024 champion, Patrick Bertoletti. Despite the win, Chestnut fell short of his own 2021 world record of 76 hot dogs. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs, though this was significantly below her record-setting performance from the prior year.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Ken Burns Discusses the Historical Significance of the American Revolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 15:29:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, arguing it fundamentally 'turned the world upside down' by creating the concept of a citizen rather than a subject. He emphasized that the Declaration of Independence's ideals, though not initially inclusive of all people, inspired centuries of global movements for equality and rights. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also stressed the importance of embracing America's complex and often contradictory history to create a richer, more inclusive national narrative.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Wimbledon champion, secured his place in the fourth round with a four-set victory over Jan-Lennard Struff. After a dominant first set, Alcaraz faced a tougher challenge as Struff's powerful serve helped him claim the second set. However, the world number two regained control, breaking the German early in the third set and again at a critical moment in the fourth. Alcaraz demonstrated his resilience under pressure to win 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 and will next face 14th seed Andrey Rublev in his ongoing title defense.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's veteran defender, Kyle Walker, is set to join newly promoted Premier League club Burnley on a two-year contract after successfully passing a medical. The 35-year-old England international spent the latter part of the previous season on loan at AC Milan. His move marks the end of an eight-year tenure at Manchester City, during which he amassed 17 major trophies, including six Premier League titles and a Champions League victory. Walker's contract with City was due to expire next summer, and Milan did not pursue a permanent deal.</p>

          <p>A provision within a major budget package signed by President Trump will eliminate federal income tax on tips for many service industry workers. The new law creates a deduction for tipped income, although workers will still be responsible for state, local, and payroll taxes. The benefit, which is set to expire in 2028 unless extended, has eligibility limits based on annual income. While the White House touts this as a significant boost for working-class Americans, critics argue it will not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal tax liability, suggesting a minimum wage increase would be more effective.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the United States in 2026. During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 spectators for the event. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the fight. The proposal is unconventional, as the White House has never before hosted a major professional sporting event of this nature on its property.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders gathered in Chisinau for the first-ever EU-Moldova summit, signaling strong support for Moldova's path to EU membership. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stated the summit proves that accession is 'no longer a distant dream,' while EU officials pledged to protect the country from Russian hybrid attacks and disinformation campaigns. The EU has provided a significant financial support package to aid Moldova's development. The summit occurs as Moldova and Ukraine, which both formally opened accession talks last year, face delays in substantive negotiations, partly due to objections from Hungary regarding Kyiv's progress.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic third day of the second Test at Edgbaston, an extraordinary partnership between Jamie Smith and Harry Brook pulled England back from the brink of collapse against India. After England lost two quick wickets early, Smith scored a rapid 184 not out, supported by Brook's 158, in a 303-run stand. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, stormed back with the second new ball, causing England to lose their last five wickets for just 20 runs. India ended the day with a commanding overall lead of 244, firmly in control of the match.</p>

          <p>New industry data reveals that one in every ten cars sold in the UK during June was manufactured in China, marking a significant increase in market share. Chinese-owned brands like MG, BYD, and Omoda accounted for 10% of UK sales, up from 6% a year ago. This surge comes as other Western nations, including the US and Canada, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to protect their domestic industries. The UK has not followed suit, creating an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers who are offering innovative and competitively priced cars, particularly in the electric vehicle sector.

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into the backbone of global finance. Major institutions like Robinhood, which announced tokenized stock trading on an Ethereum-based network, are leveraging the platform for its stability and security. While conversations focused more on infrastructure and utility than price speculation, the event highlighted a shift towards using Ethereum for real-world financial applications, from asset tokenization to stablecoin settlements. Experts believe this trend will make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more functional for a new generation of users. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Florida's reefs from rising ocean temperatures, scientists are transplanting a new generation of crossbred corals onto a reef near Miami. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other institutions, involves breeding native Florida Elkhorn corals with corals from a warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to create more 'thermally tolerant' offspring that can better survive bleaching events, which have devastated Florida's coral populations. This is the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for reef restoration across the Caribbean.</p>
