          <p>OpenAI has restructured as a public benefit corporation, ensuring that the nonprofit controlling it remains the largest shareholder. This decision addresses concerns from critics like Elon Musk, who argued that OpenAI was overly focused on profits and neglecting safety. The restructuring follows years of corporate drama and scrutiny from regulators and academics, particularly regarding the balance between rapid A.I. development and potential risks to humanity. Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, stated that the change provides a more understandable structure for the company to operate effectively, and he is confident that ongoing funding negotiations will not be affected by this shift. The New York Times has a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement regarding news content used in A.I. systems.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a prominent website for deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support. The site, which allowed users to upload and view AI-generated pornographic videos, also facilitated the buying and selling of nonconsensual content. This closure follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the posting of nonconsensual sexual imagery. Experts note that while this is a positive step, the issue of nonconsensual sexual deepfake imagery will persist, potentially pushing the community to less mainstream platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the previous Biden administration's stance. The lawsuit, filed by conservative attorneys general, challenges regulatory changes that expanded access to the drug. The Trump administration's filing avoids addressing the merits of the case, arguing that the lawsuit does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the current court. This decision may reflect a cautious political approach to abortion, especially after recent electoral outcomes favored abortion rights.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and will pay $511 million for conspiring to help wealthy U.S. taxpayers hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. This settlement addresses a criminal case where the bank facilitated tax evasion for its clients from 2010 to 2021. The Department of Justice stated that Credit Suisse committed new crimes and breached its 2014 plea agreement, in which it paid $2.6 billion for similar misconduct. Whistleblowers, former Credit Suisse bankers, provided detailed evidence of the bank's breach, leading to the recent charges.</p>

The protective effect was particularly strong in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy habits.
