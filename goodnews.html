          <h2>China's Demographic Crisis Could Ease with Male Childcare Subsidies, Research Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. The research, co-authored by academics from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield significantly higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, which threatens its economic stability and ability to catch up to developed nations. Traditional expectations that place the burden on women for childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some venture capitalists argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, many founders and VCs believe that it leads to burnout and decreased retention. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, work-life balance, and access to funding and resources rather than simply increasing working hours. The European tech scene has produced successful companies without relying on overwork, and younger generations are less tolerant of toxic hustle cultures.</p>
