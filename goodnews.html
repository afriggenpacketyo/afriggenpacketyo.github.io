        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2002. The bipartisan vote, supported by 212 Democrats and 49 Republicans, reflects a growing concern in Congress about presidents potentially abusing outdated war powers. Proponents argued that it is time for Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace, calling the decades-old authorizations obsolete. A similar measure previously passed the Senate but was never voted on in the House.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to early data from the CDC for 2024. After peaking as the third leading cause of death in 2021, its decline has contributed to a 4% overall decrease in U.S. deaths last year. Health officials note that while COVID-19 is still a significant cause of death, the trend reflects success in managing infectious diseases. Heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death, highlighting the ongoing public health challenge of chronic illnesses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina to enforce a state law that would ban a transgender student from using the school bathroom corresponding to his gender identity. This decision allows the ninth-grade student, identified as John Doe, to continue using the boys' restroom while his lawsuit against the state policy proceeds in lower courts. The ruling by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which the Supreme Court let stand for now, cited its previous decision in the Gavin Grimm case as binding precedent. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch noted they would have granted the state's request.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing a decades-long ban and will now provide N95 masks to federal firefighters to protect them from harmful smoke inhalation. The agency had previously argued that masks posed a risk of heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other wildfire-prone nations and recommendations from health agencies. The policy change follows reports detailing the health risks faced by firefighters, including a higher risk of cancer, and pressure from federal lawmakers. The move is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the significant health hazards associated with wildfire smoke exposure.</p>

          <p>Former footballer and presenter Gary Lineker has won the award for best TV presenter at the UK's National Television Awards, ending a 23-year winning streak held by the duo Ant and Dec. The win comes after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" program following controversies over his social media use. In his acceptance speech, Lineker suggested the viewer-voted award demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to speak up for others. Other major winners of the night included the finale of "Gavin and Stacey" for best comedy.</p>

          <h2>AT&T CEO Suggests iPhone 'Super Cycles' Are Over Unless Apple Delivers on AI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 17:26:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has stated that the era of massive "super cycles" for new iPhone releases may be over, as hardware improvements become less significant. Speaking at a technology conference, Stankey argued that future consumer excitement and sales will depend on major software advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence. He noted that without a compelling leap forward in AI that is unique from competitors, the new iPhone risks being seen as merely an incremental upgrade rather than a must-have device. This reflects a growing investor concern that Apple may be lagging behind rivals in the AI race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Larry Ellison, the co-founder of software company Oracle, briefly became the world's richest person, surpassing Elon Musk with a net worth of $393 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The shift was driven by a massive surge in Oracle's stock price, which soared over 40% following a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. By the end of the trading day, a slight dip in Oracle's share price returned Musk to the top spot. Ellison is a known ally of President Donald Trump and has recently been involved in AI infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, the former longtime editor in chief of Vogue, has finally shared her thoughts on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was famously based on her leadership style. Speaking on a recent podcast, Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's "fantastic" performance as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but not knowing what to expect, and ultimately found the portrayal to be less of a caricature than some in the fashion industry had feared.</p>

          <p>Oracle experienced its best trading day since 1992, with its stock price closing nearly 36% higher and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. The historic surge was fueled by the company's announcement of an astounding $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This massive backlog is driven by intense demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is essential for running the large workloads required by artificial intelligence companies. The dramatic stock gain overshadowed a quarterly earnings report that otherwise missed revenue and profit estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater, contains mineral patterns and textures that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While researchers cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, they are excited by the discovery. The next critical step is to bring the samples back to Earth for analysis with more advanced instruments.</p>
