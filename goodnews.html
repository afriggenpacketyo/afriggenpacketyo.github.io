          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is making a concerted effort to establish itself as a world-class biopharmaceutical hub, with ambitions to rival Boston. The city, which already hosts 3,800 biopharma companies, is offering substantial subsidies to attract top international firms to set up regional headquarters. By 2030, Suzhou's goal is to host over 10,000 companies and generate more than 1 trillion yuan in output value. This strategic push includes academic partnerships, such as the Academy of Pharmacy co-founded by Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, to cultivate future leaders in drug innovation.</p>

          <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has publicly defied the Trump administration's threats to prosecute leaders of "sanctuary jurisdictions" that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. In a press conference, Wu stated that "Boston will not back down" and accused the administration of attacking cities to distract from its own failures. This response follows a letter from the Department of Justice to Boston and other cities, warning of potential legal action and loss of federal funds. Wu emphasized that Boston follows the law and will continue to be a welcoming city for all residents.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament, the pairing of Britain's Jack Draper and America's Jessica Pegula defeated the highly anticipated duo of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu. The match, played in a lively atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium, was part of a new, shortened format designed to attract top singles players with a significant prize pool. Despite the crowd's support for Alcaraz and Raducanu, the more experienced doubles play of Pegula and the sharp performance of Draper secured them a 4-2 4-2 victory. The event has generated both excitement and controversy for its deviation from traditional Grand Slam formats.</p>

          <p>A new, tiny moon has been discovered orbiting the planet Uranus, NASA has announced. Designated S/2025 U1, the satellite was spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope and measures approximately six miles in diameter, making it the 29th known moon of the ice giant. Researchers believe its small size is why it remained undetected by previous missions, including the Voyager 2 flyby. The discovery suggests that Uranus may have a complex system of small inner moons and hints that more could be found with further observation. The moon will eventually be named after a character from Shakespeare or Alexander Pope.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues China's Commemoration of Wartime History Can Coexist with Appreciation for Modern Japan</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's remembrance of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression is not an effort to incite hatred but to reflect on historical truth. The author contends that commemorating the sacrifices made during the war is distinct from views on contemporary Japan and its culture. Drawing from personal experience growing up with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime, the author suggests that Chinese society can condemn Japan's past military aggression while simultaneously embracing modern Japanese culture. The piece frames the commemorations as a necessary act of reflection rather than a tool for cultivating ongoing hostility.</p>

          <p>An Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, is facing federal charges for allegedly creating and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." Prosecutors claim the botnet, comprised of malware-infected devices like routers and DVRs, was used to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets in over 80 countries. Foltz allegedly loaned out the botnet to paying customers for these attacks, which targeted entities including a U.S. government network and tech companies. Law enforcement officials dismantled the botnet after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home as part of an international effort to combat DDoS-for-hire services.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the company maintained its full-year sales forecast, even though its second-quarter earnings and revenue slightly missed Wall Street expectations. The retailer reported adjusted earnings of $4.68 per share on revenue of $45.28 billion. While the company noted a continued "deferral mindset" among homeowners for large projects due to economic uncertainty, it also saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate home improvement spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina SAU to manufacture and sell vehicles, batteries, and auto parts, covering the full EV supply chain. This development follows BYD's previous investment in an electric bus plant in Argentina and is part of its broader expansion strategy in Latin America. If production plans are confirmed, it would establish BYD's second major vehicle factory in the region, following its large-scale project in Brazil.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new, more powerful artificial intelligence chip for the Chinese market, tentatively named the B30A, which would be based on its advanced Blackwell architecture. This move comes after the U.S. government restricted the sale of high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. In response to the report, Nvidia stated it is evaluating various products to remain competitive where governments permit. The development follows a recent deal where Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China in exchange for permission to sell certain chips there.
