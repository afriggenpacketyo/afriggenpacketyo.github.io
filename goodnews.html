          <p>China's economy has demonstrated significant resilience during a turbulent first half of 2025, navigating US trade policy shifts while maintaining steady growth toward its 5% annual GDP target. Despite this, experts warn of emerging pressure points for the rest of the year, as the positive effects of front-loaded exports may diminish. Forecasts are mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in export growth to zero, while others anticipate a contraction, suggesting an uphill climb for the remainder of the year.

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay an ¬£8.4m fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, rather than wait a month to sign him for free, is already paying dividends. The investment was made to ensure his availability for the Club World Cup, and his performance, including a key assist, has helped the club secure an additional ¬£10m in prize money so far. While questions about his defensive work remain, his attacking contributions and integration into the team under manager Xabi Alonso are being praised, suggesting the calculated gamble was a success for the Spanish club.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has announced that Israel has accepted the conditions for a proposed two-month ceasefire in its conflict with Hamas. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is the best they will get and that the situation will only worsen otherwise. The details of the proposal have not been made public, and neither Israel nor Hamas has officially commented on the terms. Previous ceasefire efforts have stalled, but this new push, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, represents a potentially significant development in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Major Environmental Law Reform to Boost Housing Construction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:37:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in over 50 years, a move aimed at accelerating housing construction. Championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the new legislation waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise developments in urban areas, eliminating lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits that often delay projects. This reform represents a major political shift, prioritizing housing abundance over the procedural hurdles that have historically stifled development. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the removal of this key regulatory barrier is considered a seismic change in the state's approach to its housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos has sold over 3.3 million shares of the company, valued at roughly $737 million, according to a recent financial filing. The transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan that was adopted in March, which allows for the sale of up to 25 million shares by May 2026. Bezos, who remains the company's largest individual shareholder, has regularly sold stock to fund other ventures, including his space exploration company Blue Origin and his nonprofit preschool initiative, Day 1 Academies. The sale follows his recent high-profile wedding in Venice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to recent immigration raids involving masked federal agents, a new bill has been introduced in Congress to prohibit such practices. The "No Masks for ICE Act," backed by several California Democrats, would make it illegal for federal immigration agents to cover their faces during enforcement actions unless required for health or safety reasons. The legislation would also mandate that agents clearly display their names and agency affiliations on their uniforms. Proponents argue the bill is necessary for accountability and to help the public distinguish legitimate officers from impersonators, who have been a growing problem.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a strict new anti-smoking law, banning smoking in most public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools and public transit. The move aims to "denormalize" smoking, especially among young people, as tobacco-related illnesses claim 75,000 lives in the country annually. Violators of the new ban face fines starting at 135 euros. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public spaces since 2008, over 30% of French adults still smoke. The last remaining refuge for smokers, the outdoor terraces of caf√©s, remains a contentious issue for business owners and patrons alike.</p>
