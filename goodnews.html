          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie Jacob Misiorowski, known for throwing triple-digit fastballs, made MLB history after taking a perfect game into the seventh inning in his second career start. Misiorowski, who was clocked at 103 mph, started his career with 11 consecutive no-hit innings, becoming the first starting pitcher in the modern era to achieve this feat. After issuing a walk and then allowing a home run, Misiorowski was pulled from the game to a standing ovation, having thrown 86 pitches, 60 for strikes, as the Brewers went on to secure a 17-6 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</p>

          <p>The White House Rose Garden is undergoing significant renovations, with the grass center square being replaced with gravel and construction equipment present. President Trump stated the changes were made due to people falling during press conferences, citing the terrain being wet and high heels causing issues for women. Despite criticism on social media about removing a piece of White House history, a White House official described the construction as a "restoration" to preserve the beauty of the space and enhance its practical use for special events.</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison in Belarus, along with other political prisoners. The release came as US special envoy Keith Kellogg visited Minsk and met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, as Tikhanovskaya expressed gratitude to Donald Trump and European allies for their efforts, but emphasized that over a thousand political prisoners remain in jail. The released prisoners, including Belarusian, Japanese, Polish, and Swedish citizens, are receiving care in Lithuania, while Maria Kolesnikova, another prominent opposition leader, remains imprisoned.</p>

          <p>Ashley Kaye, 36, sold her childhood home after her father's death to travel the world full-time in a Toyota Tacoma truck, a decision prompted by a scuba diving trip and the realization that life is too short.

Kaye emphasizes the importance of pursuing one's dreams and living life to the fullest, inspired by her father's belief that she could achieve anything.</p>

          <h2>French Scientists Discover New Blood Type in Guadeloupe Woman</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe, marking the 48th blood group system recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The discovery was made after researchers found an unusual antibody in the patient's blood sample during routine tests, leading to the identification of a genetic mutation through high-throughput DNA sequencing. The woman is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, inherited from both parents, and scientists hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say US sunscreens are less effective than those available overseas, particularly in protecting against ultraviolet radiation in the form of UVA rays, as a heatwave approaches. The concern stems from regulatory differences, as sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug in the US, leading to a lengthy approval process for new UV-filtering ingredients. While US sunscreens generally do a good job at blocking UVB rays, experts point out that the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in more than 20 years, as a bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations.</p>
