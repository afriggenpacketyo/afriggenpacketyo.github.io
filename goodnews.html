        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the "Building Energy Act," aiming to reverse key climate protection measures implemented by the previous Green Party administration. Reiche intends to abolish the operating ban on older gas boilers, prioritizing energy supply security alongside climate protection. Critics argue that these plans could lead to new fossil fuel dependencies, while the government emphasizes the need for new gas-fired power plants. Despite these shifts, a significant investment program for infrastructure includes substantial funding for climate protection, highlighting ongoing tensions between economic and environmental priorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom after failing to meet delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class post arriving late. The company missed its target for second-class post as well, prompting concerns from regulators and consumer advocates. Royal Mail attributes the issues to ongoing modernization efforts and the need for reform of its universal service obligation (USO), which requires deliveries six days a week. Citizens Advice has criticized the company for hiking stamp prices while failing to deliver on time, calling for greater regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's victory in the Romanian presidential election was significantly influenced by record numbers of ethnic Hungarian and Moldovan voters. Conservative estimates suggest that these groups contributed between 500,000 and 700,000 votes to Dan's lead, securing the pro-European candidate's win against a hard-right opponent. The Hungarian minority defied Viktor Orban's endorsement of the hard-right candidate, while Moldovans favored Dan due to his pro-EU stance and his opponent's unpopular views on reunification. This outcome highlights the crucial role of minority groups in safeguarding democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic trajectory.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, with a spokesperson citing a commitment to bringing down child poverty and a strategy publication "later this year." The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy preventing most families from claiming benefits for third or additional children. Critics have condemned the delay, while some suggest it could allow for a more effective strategy with better measures to protect children from hardship.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized the importance of mutual respect in EU-US trade relations. European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best path forward.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, marking a shift from previous generations' work ethic. A study found that 45% of workers aged 20 to 59 are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with those in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. The primary motivation is to have more "me time" and avoid the sacrifices their parents made for their companies.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to lower prices to 2,000 yen per 5 kg to ease the burden on consumers. The move comes amid rising criticism of the government's failure to curb soaring rice prices, which have hurt households amid broader inflation. Koizumi intends to bypass auctions and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. However, analysts caution that the limited reserve amount may not significantly impact overall rice prices.</p>
