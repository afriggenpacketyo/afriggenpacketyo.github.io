          <h2>US Trade Court Blocks Trump's Sweeping Tariffs, Citing Unilateral Authority Overreach</h2>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies, as the Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court emphasized that the US Constitution reserves the power to regulate commerce with other nations exclusively to Congress, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The court also blocked levies on China, Mexico, and Canada, which were imposed in response to concerns about drugs and illegal immigration. The Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling, while the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision, asserting that no president has the power to unilaterally raise taxes, as these tariffs would have led to inflation, economic damage, and job losses. The optimism that the court's decision to curb presidential power is not necessarily a sign of the economy's future.</p>

          <p>A Salvadorian immigrant family made three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Canada, fleeing potential deportations from the US. Despite having relatives in Canada, their initial attempts were thwarted due to documentation issues and stricter border policies. Immigration experts note an increase in asylum seekers at the border, fleeing not only their homelands but also President Trump's immigration policies. Canada has invested in strengthening border security, partly to placate Trump, who has blamed the country for illegal immigration into the US. The family's story highlights the challenges faced by asylum seekers navigating complex immigration laws and policies. The family's persistence and eventual success in seeking asylum provide a glimmer of hope amidst a difficult situation.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, delivering a blow to a major tenet of the president's economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court stated that implementing tariffs typically requires congressional approval, which Trump bypassed by declaring a national economic emergency. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling a victory for working families, small businesses, and everyday Americans.

          <p>A panel of federal judges has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, finding that federal law did not grant him ‚Äúunbounded authority‚Äù to tax imports. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump‚Äôs tariffs ‚Äúexceed any authority granted‚Äù to the president by the emergency powers law, delivering a setback to his efforts to pressure other nations into striking trade deals more beneficial to the United States. The ruling does not affect tariffs issued under separate legal authorities, including levies on steel, aluminum, and cars. A White House spokesman rebuked the court, saying that unfair trade relationships had ‚Äúdecimated American communities,‚Äù but the administration immediately filed plans to appeal.

          <p>The government is fast-tracking two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to shore up England's water supplies, declaring them "nationally significant" to expedite the planning process. The projects, slated for completion in 2036 and 2040 respectively, aim to provide more resilience to future droughts in a dry region with high water demand. The move comes amid concerns about rising temperatures, a growing population, and extra demand from new houses and data centers, potentially squeezing water supplies. Some experts caution that managing water usage and cutting waste should take precedence, while others stress the need to balance local objections with the greater good of securing water resources. The government also intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" as well.</p>

Ngugi was a passionate advocate for African authors to eschew the languages of foreign occupiers and is celebrated for composing the first modern novel in the Gikuyu language while imprisoned. He spent many prolific years in exile, continuing to write and influence literature. Given his contributions to literature and social commentary, his passing is a significant loss.

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The US Court of International Trade's decision argues that Trump surpassed these limits and reads federal trade laws to place rigid constraints on his ability to continue his trade war. The court concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 does not grant Trump unlimited tariff authority and that the tariffs do not effectively address the threat of drug trafficking. The decision, which can be appealed, has significant implications for Trump's trade policies. The legal checks and balances being applied here are a good thing.</p>

The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, which has successfully translocated juvenile and sub-adult golden eagles from the Scottish Highlands. These eagles have been sighted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and even as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The population in the south of Scotland has risen to approximately 50, and experts are optimistic that a golden eagle population could establish itself in England. The return of these majestic birds to their former habitats is a positive sign for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>California has joined 15 other states in filing suit against the National Science Foundation, alleging the agency has illegally terminated millions of dollars in grants and imposed new fees that have ended or crippled vital research. The lawsuit targets the NSF for terminating grants for scientific research that seeks to promote and understand diversity in higher education and the workforce. The suit also seeks to overturn the Trump administration‚Äôs 15% cap on indirect costs related to research, which universities say are critical to carrying out their work. The federal actions have come at extreme cost, with Trump wanting to make America‚Äôs universities second tier with his backwards efforts to slash research funding. The efforts to protect science and innovation are heartening.</p>

          <h2>Musk Confirms White House Exit After Split with Trump on Tax Bill</h2>

          <p>Elon Musk confirmed his time at the White House was officially coming to an end after publicly criticizing President Trump's signature tax bill. Musk has sneered at the bill in a series of social media posts and interviews, saying it would increase the budget deficit and undermines the work his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is doing. The disagreement between Trump and Musk comes as Musk signaled his intent to spend less time in Washington and more on his businesses. This marks a drastic turnaround for Musk, who dedicated most of the last year to promoting Trump and far-right ideology online. Musk's departure and criticism of the tax bill could lead to a more balanced policy approach.</p>

          <h2>Judge Orders Trump Administration to Lift Pause on Certain Immigration Applications</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:14:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on various immigration applications, saying it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. The ruling affects immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine, and other parts of the world whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. lawfully had been threatened. The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in violation of federal administrative law. The ruling is a reprieve for many immigrants and challenges the Trump administration's efforts to scale back parole programs. The effort to defend due process suggests a positive outlook.</p>

          <h2>Japan Opposition Leader Criticized for Calling Government Reserve Rice "Animal Feed"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the Democratic Party for the People, has drawn criticism for referring to the government's rice stockpiles as "animal feed in a year." Tamaki was referring to reserve rice from 2021 that the government plans to release to the public to curb soaring prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi called Tamaki's remark unfortunate, especially as the government is working on the best way to release it. Official data showed rice prices in Japan hit a new record in April, marking a 98.4 percent increase from a year earlier. The government's efforts to address the rice shortage and price spike suggest a positive outlook.</p>
