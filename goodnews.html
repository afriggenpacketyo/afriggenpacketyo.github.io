          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed online criticism after she was condemned for attending an Oasis reunion concert without her children. After sharing photos from the event, a user commented that she had "forgotten" she has two kids, prompting Turner to clap back about the existence of shared custody. She explained that her children were likely with their father, her ex-husband Joe Jonas, on that day. The exchange, which drew widespread support from her fans, comes nearly a year after the couple finalized their divorce and custody agreement.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years, defeating American JJ Spaun in a three-hole sudden-death play-off at the St. Jude Championship. Rose clinched the win with a birdie on the third extra hole after both players had matched each other with a par and a birdie. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with a one-stroke lead but finished tied for third after a late bogey. The result continues Fleetwood's long wait for a maiden PGA Tour win despite significant career earnings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 19:42:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This follows warnings that there are significantly more graduates than available positions, with about 4,000 more nursing and midwifery graduates than open jobs. While nursing unions welcomed the move cautiously, employer representatives raised concerns about how the additional staff would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance made a strong case for the backup role behind Justin Herbert. Lance demonstrated growing confidence, utilizing his mobility to extend plays and scoring a five-yard touchdown on a designed run. He completed 7 of 14 passes for 55 yards and rushed for 48 yards, outshining fellow backup Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted strong performances from defensive end Caleb Murphy and undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rodgers, who had two interceptions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have reportedly reached an unprecedented agreement with the White House to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from specific chips sold in China. In return, the companies will receive export licenses for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which are designed to comply with U.S. restrictions. This arrangement highlights the administration's strategy of using tariffs and export controls as bargaining tools in its ongoing economic and technological competition with Beijing. The deal follows a meeting between Nvidia's CEO and President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Blocks Commercial Fishing in Pacific Marine Monument, Overturning Trump-Era Rollback</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has ruled that commercial fishing is illegal within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, effectively overturning a Trump administration directive. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had allowed fishing in areas protected by the Obama administration. The ruling affirms that regulations banning commercial fishing in the monument remain in effect, representing a significant victory for environmental and Native Hawaiian groups who sued to protect the ecologically and culturally vital area. The court stated the administration had violated federal law by bypassing the required public comment process.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new-look team, featuring four summer signings in the starting lineup, was unveiled at the Community Shield match against Crystal Palace, which ended in a 2-2 draw and a penalty shootout loss for the Reds. New acquisitions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong showed flashes of brilliance, with both scoring on their competitive debuts. However, the article notes that defensive vulnerabilities remain, as Liverpool twice surrendered leads and looked sloppy at the back. Manager Arne Slot acknowledged that the revamped team needs time to adapt, suggesting that while the attack looks promising, defensive reinforcements are still needed before the transfer window closes.</p>
