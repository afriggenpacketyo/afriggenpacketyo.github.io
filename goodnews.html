          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, re-entered the atmosphere after 53 years. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, and the European Space Agency also indicated Kosmos 482 had reentered after it failed to appear over a German radar station. Experts predicted that some or all of the half-ton spacecraft, designed to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive the descent. The chances of anyone being hit by debris were considered exceedingly low.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's government overhaul, ruling that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs for 14 days, stating that the President may only broadly restructure federal agencies when authorized by Congress. The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency". The plaintiffs argued that the administration's reorganization efforts have disrupted critical services and exceeded its authority.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management and Charles River Laboratories have entered into a cooperation agreement, resulting in the appointment of four new directors, including Elliott's Steven Barg, to Charles River's board. As part of the agreement, Charles River will conduct a strategic review, with Elliott's designated directors participating in the strategic committee. The company's shares have slumped due to challenges including a post-pandemic pullback in preclinical research demand and concerns regarding the future of animal testing. Elliott's involvement aims to explore various avenues to create shareholder value, such as evaluating the Manufacturing Solutions business, considering strategic acquisitions, and potentially exploring a sale of the whole company.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the rapidly falling rates of family formation and birth rates in the US and the rest of the world, arguing that this issue is becoming increasingly partisan. It emphasizes that supporting people in deciding whether to have children is too important to surrender to culture wars. The article argues that a shrinking population could lead to a decrease in quality of life, a smaller working population supporting a larger elderly population, and environmental challenges. It advocates for progressive policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and support for new parents to address this demographic crisis.</p>

          <p>A Chicago homeowner, Marco Velazquez, discovered squatters living in his property and, unable to get immediate help from the police, decided to move in with them. Velazquez, his wife, and friends camped out in the living room while the alleged squatters occupied a bedroom. Eventually, Velazquez negotiated a cash-for-keys deal, paying the couple $4,300 to leave and sign a release. The case highlights the legal challenges property owners face with squatters, as police often require a court order for removal. Senate Bill 1563 is working toward allowing police to remove squatters without requiring the eviction process.</p>

          <p>Researchers have determined that a spear tip carved from bone, unearthed in Russia in 2003, dates back 80,000 years, indicating it was not created by modern humans. Since Homo sapiens didn't venture into Europe until about 45,000 years ago, the creators were most likely Neanderthals. This discovery suggests that Neanderthals had advanced beyond stone tools, using techniques previously attributed only to modern humans. The spear tip joins other recent finds demonstrating Neanderthals' proficiency in bone toolmaking, challenging previous assumptions about their technological capabilities.</p>
