        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has initiated an antitrust probe into German software giant SAP over concerns regarding its software support services. The investigation will focus on whether SAP distorted competition in the maintenance and support market for its on-premise Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. SAP has stated its belief that its practices comply with EU rules but is cooperating with the commission. The probe is notable as it targets a major European company, contrasting with the EU's more frequent antitrust actions against U.S. Big Tech firms.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Guardians have made baseball history by overcoming a 15.5-game deficit to take sole possession of first place in the American League Central. Their 5-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers marks the largest comeback to take a division or league lead since MLB switched to a divisional format in 1969. The team's remarkable turnaround has been fueled by an 18-5 record in September and a starting pitching rotation that has allowed two or fewer runs in 19 consecutive games. With a one-game lead and the tiebreaker over Detroit, Cleveland's playoff chances have surged dramatically.</p>

          <p>A new research report indicates that U.S. Latino immigrants generated $1.6 trillion in GDP in 2023, with the total U.S. Latino cohort's purchasing power reaching $4.1 trillion. The study, conducted by economists at Arizona State University, found that the U.S. Latino GDP grew by 50% from 2015 to 2023, driven by increased education and entrepreneurship. The report also highlights the growing share of Latino consumer spending in the American economy, while warning that mass deportations could significantly undermine this economic progress and lead to a broader GDP decline.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce a new funding program, "Pride in Place," aimed at revitalizing over 330 "overlooked" communities across the country. The initiative will provide extra investment for projects backed by local residents, such as tackling litter, improving high streets, or building new sports grounds. The plan also encourages councils to use existing powers to purchase derelict shops and block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops. The government says the program is designed to put power directly into the hands of local people to restore pride in their neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>According to a recent study, 47% of Americans do not have a written financial plan, a step that experts say is crucial for effective retirement preparation. Financial advisors recommend that individuals seeking professional help should interview multiple candidates to find a good personal and professional fit. Key steps include conducting background checks through regulatory bodies like FINRA, asking direct questions about an advisor's experience and compensation structure, and ensuring they hold relevant credentials like the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation. The goal is to find a long-term financial partner who understands one's specific circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares in H&M surged after the fashion retailer announced third-quarter operating profits that significantly beat analyst expectations, signaling that its corporate turnaround strategy is gaining momentum. The Swedish company reported a 40% year-on-year increase in operating profit, attributing the strong performance to tight cost controls, an improved customer offering, and increased operational efficiencies. This marks the second consecutive quarter of positive results under CEO Daniel Erver, who has focused on store revamps and digitization to better compete with rivals like Zara-owner Inditex.

          <p>A diplomatic dispute between the United States and Norway appears to be resolving, according to Norway's foreign minister. The disagreement arose after Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from the U.S. company Caterpillar, citing the use of its equipment by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank, a move that troubled the U.S. State Department. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide stated that his government has explained to U.S. officials that the decision was made independently by the central bank's board based on ethical guidelines, not as a governmental policy, which has helped to settle the matter.</p>

          <p>In an effort to make phones more usable for actual communication, Apple has introduced new features in iOS 26 to combat the deluge of spam. A new, opt-in AI-powered feature allows Siri to screen calls from unknown numbers, transcribing the caller's reason for calling in real-time so the user can decide whether to answer. The update also includes enhanced, multi-layered filtering for text messages, automatically sorting messages from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate folders. These tools represent a more aggressive approach by tech companies to reclaim communication channels from the control of scammers and robocallers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Student Data Suggests AI Has Changed How, Not How Much, Students Cheat</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the widespread panic about an academic integrity crisis, new research suggests that generative AI has not necessarily increased the overall rate of student cheating. Instead, AI tools like ChatGPT appear to have captured a market share from pre-existing methods of academic dishonesty, such as copying from websites or using essay mills. Studies show that the percentage of students engaging in cheating behaviors has remained relatively stable before and after the release of ChatGPT. The analysis calls for a more nuanced conversation about why students cheat and how educational institutions should adapt to a world where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to improve its pricing transparency for consumers. The probe was launched after fan complaints about the sale of tickets for Oasis's reunion tour, where a tiered pricing system led to confusion and unexpectedly high costs. Ticketmaster will now have to provide more advance information about pricing structures and better clarity during online queues. The CMA stated it found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing" in the Oasis sale but emphasized that the new commitments will help fans make more informed purchasing decisions.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is strategically using soccer to connect with voters and advance his progressive platform. He recently launched a petition challenging FIFA's dynamic pricing model for the 2026 World Cup, demanding affordable tickets for local residents, which aligns with his campaign's central theme of affordability. This move is seen as a shrewd way to engage a younger, progressive-leaning demographic that has been largely ignored by Democratic leaders in recent years. By framing a popular sport through the lens of economic fairness, Mamdani is pioneering a new approach to political outreach on the left.</p>
