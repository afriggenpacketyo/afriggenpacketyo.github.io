        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wells Fargo's asset cap has been removed, leading analysts to forecast more upside for the stock. The seven-year lid on Wells' balance sheet growth was precipitated by the bank's past misdeeds, such as its notorious fake accounts scandal in the 2010s. The removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap allows the bank to grow its deposit base, invest in high-growth lines of business, and lower compliance costs. The bank has missed out on an estimated $400 billion in deposits over the past seven years due to the cap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the New York City Democratic mayoral primary approaching, former Governor Andrew Cuomo is vying for a comeback after resigning amid allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. Cuomo faces competition from Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist candidate gaining traction with progressive policies. While incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent, the Democratic primary winner is likely to become the next mayor. Cuomo's name recognition and past record contribute to his favorable polling, while Mamdani's populist appeal and DSA support make him a candidate to watch.</p>

          <p>This article is a tribute to Edmund White, a celebrated American writer known for his sexually explicit essays and memoirs. The author reflects on White's unique ability to find joy and pleasure in life, even as he aged and faced illness. White's work often explored the messy mechanics of sex and love, challenging the trend of removing such topics from literature. He was also remembered for his engaging gossip and ability to connect with people from all walks of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require American medical schools to offer nutrition courses or risk losing federal funding from the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy expressed concern that medical schools focus on treating illnesses with drugs rather than preventing them with food. While some medical schools claim to already offer sufficient nutrition education, a 2015 study indicated that medical students spend an average of only 19 hours on required nutrition education. Experts like Dr. David Eisenberg support the move, arguing that requiring nutrition education is long overdue.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed an innovative solution to address President Trump's efforts to undermine civil service protections. The court argues that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is unable to fulfill its role due to Trump's actions, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal employees vulnerable, and it challenges the Supreme Court's embrace of the "unitary executive" theory, which has enabled Trump to fire officials with civil service protections.</p>

          <p>An AI program trained to study handwriting styles of ancient manuscripts suggests many of the Dead Sea Scrolls might be older than previously thought. The new method combines AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis to more accurately estimate an ancient text's age. The proposed redating of some scrolls could reshape our understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and of Judaism and early Christianity, the authors say. The AI model was first trained on 24 manuscripts with reliable radiocarbon dating, then used to analyze the handwriting style of 135 scrolls with unknown dates.</p>
