          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 08:03:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes after criticism that the 100% rate was too harsh, though experts warn that even a 50% clawback can still cause financial hardship for beneficiaries. Overpayments occur when beneficiaries receive more than they are owed, often due to reporting errors or agency processing delays. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate or a waiver of recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pronatalist policies, aimed at increasing birth rates, are gaining traction, with some advisors to Donald Trump advocating for measures to encourage childbirth. However, experts argue that policies should embrace diverse family structures, rather than focusing solely on traditional married couples. Research indicates that the quality of relationships and acceptance from the outside world are more influential on a child's well-being than the specific household arrangement. Subsidizing assisted reproductive technologies, expanding family leave policies, and encouraging co-parenting among friends are suggested as ways to support various family types.
