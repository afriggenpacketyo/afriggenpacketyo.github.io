          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence weeks after her American Eagle ad campaign sparked a divided public response. The campaign, which used the tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans" as a play on "genes," was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others defended it against "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends. American Eagle released a statement clarifying the campaign was always about the jeans, while reputation experts suggest the controversy could ultimately boost the actress's career.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood restaurant that bears his name, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Tana, a former professional soccer player, opened his Italian eatery in 1964, and it quickly became a favored spot for Hollywood's elite, known for its clubby atmosphere and discreet service. For decades, celebrities from Elizabeth Taylor to George Clooney were regulars, with some even having dishes named after them. Though Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, it has remained an enduring Los Angeles institution.</p>

          <h2>Decades-Old "85th Percentile" Rule for Setting U.S. Speed Limits Faces Re-evaluation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is coming under increased scrutiny across the United States. The rule suggests that a road's speed limit should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, effectively letting drivers dictate the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response to rising traffic fatalities, some states and cities are now exploring new methods that prioritize safety and road context over driver speed.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop New Technique for Clearer 3D Organ Imaging</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method for making biological tissues, including brains, transparent to allow for highly detailed 3D imaging. The technique preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. By preparing the tissue into an "ionic glassy" state, scientists can create vivid and accurate models of its inner workings. This advancement could provide clearer insights into complex biological systems and allows for long-term storage of the prepared samples.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic mistakes by their rivals. The Padres' struggles were highlighted in the early innings, with three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith and a costly dropped fly ball that led to two runs. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who have now won the season series against San Diego, securing a potential tiebreaker advantage. The win moves the Dodgers back into the undisputed lead of the National League West.</p>

          <h2>China Explores "Scissor Wing" Design for Hypersonic Drone Carrier Aircraft</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier based on a "scissor wing" or oblique wing concept first explored by NASA. The innovative design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates as the aircraft's speed increases, optimizing performance across subsonic, transonic, and hypersonic flight regimes. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but at Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This approach aims to solve the longstanding aerodynamic challenge of creating a vehicle that performs well at both low and extremely high speeds.</p>

          <h2>A Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Reasons People Have Affairs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological drivers that can lead people to risk their careers and families by having an affair. The reasons include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to always be "good," the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can lead to seeking solace elsewhere as a form of reprieve or retaliation. The article also notes that a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating one's life and priorities.</p>

          <h2>Small Aircraft Conducts Emergency Landing on San Diego Highway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small private airplane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego on Saturday afternoon due to apparent mechanical issues. The aircraft was reportedly flying from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station when the emergency occurred. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene near Carroll Canyon Road in Sorrento Valley. Fortunately, no injuries were reported from the incident, though the landing caused a significant closure of the southbound lanes of the highway as authorities investigated and worked to remove the plane.</p>
