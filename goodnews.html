          <p>Elon Musk announced the end of his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, thanking President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. As a "special government employee," Musk's role was limited to 130 days per year, a limit he reached towards the end of May. Musk expressed confidence that the cost-cutting mission of DOGE would continue to strengthen within the government. His departure marks the conclusion of a period where the tech entrepreneur contributed to streamlining government operations.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided seemingly strong guidance, but the market response was muted due to the influence of a weaker U.S. dollar on the company's outlook. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share beat estimates. The company's AI products, Data Cloud and Agentforce, showed progress, contributing over $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Despite positive signs in AI adoption and increased full-year outlook, investors remain cautious due to the impact of foreign exchange tailwinds on the company's financial performance (not investment advice).</p>

However, O.C.G. was subsequently deported to Mexico, where he had previously been held and sexually assaulted, before being sent to Guatemala.

          <p>The government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. The change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, means it could be easier for millions of homes in England to install a heat pump. However, consumer groups warn that the biggest barrier remains the high upfront costs, especially for older housing stock requiring upgrades to pipework and insulation. The planning changes also include a relaxation of the rules for the size and number of heat pumps households can install.</p>
