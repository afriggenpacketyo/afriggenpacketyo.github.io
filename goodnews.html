          <p>The White House has announced a 90-day delay on a significant tariff hike for Chinese goods, extending a temporary truce in the ongoing trade war. This executive order maintains the current 30% tariff rate, preventing a potential jump to 80% that was scheduled to take effect. The extension provides more time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to work towards a long-term trade agreement, a move seen by officials as a positive step to avoid major disruptions to global trade. Economists remain divided on the overall impact of the tariff strategy on the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unusual agreement has been reached where U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will give the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns over China's AI dominance. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the figure down from 20% for the benefit of the country. This revenue-sharing plan is a novel approach to export controls, allowing U.S. companies to compete in the Chinese market while the government collects a portion of the profits.

          <p>Researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to detect the presence of the critically endangered axolotl in the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City. This large salamander, once abundant, is now nearly impossible to find in the wild due to habitat degradation and pollution. By filtering water and searching for genetic traces, scientists can monitor the species' dwindling population without relying on physical capture. While DNA has been found primarily in protected refuge areas, its discovery in one unprotected site offers a small sign of resilience, highlighting the urgent need for greater conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Sheila Jordan, a singular and highly respected voice in jazz, has passed away at the age of 96. Known for her unique style and her landmark 1960s album "Portrait of Sheila," she was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2012. Jordan's career was marked by personal challenges, including racial prejudice and single motherhood, but she remained dedicated to her craft and became a distinguished educator. A close friend of Charlie Parker, who called her "the lady with the million dollar ears," Jordan continued to perform and record well into her 90s, leaving a lasting legacy in the jazz world.</p>

Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is seen as further proof of her resurgence, demonstrating she can compete at the highest level as she continues to climb back into the top 40. The 22-year-old's improved fitness and resilience were on full display in the intense battle. This strong showing is a positive sign for Raducanu ahead of the upcoming US Open, the Grand Slam she famously won in 2021.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Productions has signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix, ensuring their partnership with the streaming giant continues. However, this new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive and lucrative than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content and covered overhead costs. The couple has produced several projects, including the popular documentary series "Harry & Meghan." Their upcoming slate includes a second season of Meghan's cooking show and a film adaptation of the romance novel "Meet Me at the Lake."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The project, proposed by New York developer Mack Real Estate, is planned for a site currently used as a parking lot and will include 536 rental units and ground-floor retail space. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, and experts note that building is challenging in the current financial climate due to high interest rates and rising costs. Despite these hurdles, demand for housing in downtown L.A. remains strong, with occupancy rates holding steady around 90%.</p>

Sinclair is also considering spinning off its ventures unit, which includes the Tennis Channel. The company's stock rose nearly 13% in after-market trading following the announcement, which could reshape the broadcast landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty-two-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance to help the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory over the London Spirit at Old Trafford. Baker's opening spell was exceptional, as he conceded only four runs from his first 10 deliveries while challenging international cricket stars David Warner and Kane Williamson with his pace and swing. His economical bowling was crucial in restricting the Spirit's chase. Team captain Phil Salt compared Baker's performance to that of England legend James Anderson, highlighting the young player's significant talent and potential in the sport.</p>

          <p>Ticketing marketplace StubHub is reportedly moving forward with its initial public offering (IPO), now targeting a September debut after pausing its plans in April amid market volatility.

The revival of its IPO plans is another sign of life in the public markets, which have seen a recent flurry of activity from tech startups after an extended dry spell, though StubHub faces significant competition in the ticketing industry.
