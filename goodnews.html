        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has postponed the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods by signing an executive order that extends the deadline for another 90 days. The tariffs were scheduled to revert to peak levels on Tuesday, but this delay provides more time for trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. This move is the latest in a series of unpredictable trade policy shifts, which have included multiple pauses and alterations to tariff implementations. The extension follows a recent request from President Trump for China to significantly increase its purchases of U.S. soybeans to help reduce the trade deficit.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service, a technology that introduced many households to the web in the 1990s, effective September 30. The service, known for its distinctive connection sound, has been largely replaced by broadband, with fewer than 300,000 U.S. users remaining as of 2023. At its peak, AOL boasted over 30 million subscribers and was a dominant force online before its influence waned following the rise of faster internet alternatives and a widely criticized merger with Time Warner. The company, now owned by Apollo Global, stated it is discontinuing the service to focus on the modern digital landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including U.S.-based Albemarle, surged on Monday after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The suspension was due to an expired permit, and the company is currently working to renew it. This specific mine is a significant player, accounting for an estimated 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. The production halt has intensified investor expectations of rising lithium prices, as the global supply was already anticipated to be in a tight balance with demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty with fluctuating inflation and interest rates, certificates of deposit (CDs) present a stable alternative to the volatile stock market for some savers. This article outlines the potential interest earnings on a $50,000 CD across various terms, from three months to five years, based on current high rates. For instance, a one-year CD could yield approximately $2,200, while a five-year term could generate over $11,000 in predictable, FDIC-insured returns. This makes CDs a potentially viable option for those prioritizing security over higher-risk growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks, including Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands, experienced a significant rally on Monday after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. The potential move from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug would have major implications, such as easing tax burdens and encouraging institutional investment in the industry. Trump stated a determination would be made in the coming weeks on the complex subject. While the reclassification process technically falls to the Attorney General, the president's public support has fueled optimism for what could be a "game changer" for the cannabis market.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to a unique arrangement with the U.S. government, sharing 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal, brokered by the Trump administration, allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, respectively, to the crucial Chinese market. Analysts view the move as unusual but a net positive for the companies, as 85% of revenue is preferable to zero. The agreement highlights a transactional approach to trade policy and raises questions about whether this sets a precedent for other strategic sectors, though experts believe it is unlikely to extend beyond semiconductors.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery. The movie theater chain posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, a 35% increase year-over-year, and significantly narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million from $32.8 million a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the success to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and record-high revenue per patron. The company has also successfully restructured its debt, pushing maturities to 2029 and creating a more stable financial foundation for future growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the world transitions to renewable energy, concerns are growing about potential shortages of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and tellurium, a concept dubbed "peak mineral." A new study in Nature Climate Change projects that even with moderate emission cuts, the world could face shortfalls of up to 12 minerals by 2100. However, the article suggests that these fears may be premature, drawing a parallel to how technology overcame "peak oil" predictions. Rapid innovation in clean energy, such as the development of sodium-ion batteries and cobalt-free chemistries, is already reducing reliance on certain scarce materials, indicating that substitution and new technologies could mitigate future supply constraints.</p>

          <p>For beginner investors navigating an uncertain economy, gold can serve as a valuable portfolio diversifier and a hedge against inflation. However, this article advises new investors to consider several factors before buying gold. They should evaluate their short-term financial goals, as gold is more of a wealth preserver than an income generator. Additionally, beginners must be aware of gold's price volatility and the current high cost per ounce. Ultimately, the decision depends on an individual's need for diversification and their long-term strategy, making consultation with a financial expert a prudent step. (not investment advice)</p>

However, former player Jamie Noon advises that a return to glory may be slow, as recruitment for the upcoming season is largely complete and the club must operate within the league's salary cap.

          <p>This article provides a five-step guide for individuals whose bank accounts have been frozen by a debt collector, a legal but jarring collection tactic. The first step is to contact the bank to confirm the freeze and gather information about the court order behind it. Subsequently, individuals should review the judgment for errors, identify and claim any legally exempt funds like Social Security, and consider negotiating a settlement directly with the collector. For overwhelming debt, exploring professional debt relief options or consulting a bankruptcy attorney may be the most effective path to regaining financial control.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, effectively overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs ruling had stated that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face the country's 39% tariff rate, which caused the price of gold to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures dropped by 2.48%. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that the tariffs could negatively impact the international flow of physical gold, a concern now alleviated by the president's intervention.</p>
