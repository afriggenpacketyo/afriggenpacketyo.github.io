        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink believes that the company's acquisition of Preqin, an alternative asset data provider, could be its most consequential deal, potentially revolutionizing private markets. Preqin's data will be integrated into BlackRock platforms like Aladdin and eFront, providing clients with enhanced visibility into non-public investments. This move aims to bring transparency to private markets, similar to what Zillow did for housing, and reduce BlackRock's reliance on the volatile stock market. The deal is expected to attract more clients, deepen existing relationships, and expand BlackRock's presence in the growing private markets sector, despite potential regulatory scrutiny.

          <p>An associate director at Vox, born and raised in Los Angeles as the daughter of immigrants, shares her perspective on the city beyond the sensationalized news coverage of ICE raids and protests. She emphasizes the resilience and camaraderie within the immigrant community, highlighting their significant contributions to Los Angeles' culture and economy. Contrary to the narrative of Los Angeles being "invaded" and "lawless," she argues that immigrants have quietly built the city, citing their tax contributions and the Latino influence on its identity. She contrasts the media's focus on chaos and unrest with the everyday lives of immigrants who face challenges such as language barriers and exploitation, underscoring the need for nuanced storytelling that recognizes their humanity and sacrifices.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) in drug approvals to "radically increase efficiency." This initiative comes as the agency faces a Trump-driven reduction of nearly 2,000 employees. Agency officials view AI as a way to expedite the process of bringing drugs to market. The move reflects a broader trend of leveraging technology to streamline operations and address workforce challenges within government agencies, potentially impacting the speed and thoroughness of drug approval processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent market volatility under President Trump's second term, investors' portfolio balances may not be significantly different from when he first took office. The S&P 500 has experienced some unnerving days due to tariff policies, with several days of notable declines, but the annualized return for Trump's second presidency remains positive at 1.58%. This underscores the importance of staying calm during market fluctuations, as volatility does not necessarily predict direction. While other presidential terms have seen larger returns, the long-term trend of investing over decades and multiple presidencies remains beneficial for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 Tribeca Festival features an Immersive program titled "In Search of Us," which explores the impacts of technology on humanity through virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence. One notable VR exhibit, "Fragile Home," recreates a home in Ukraine before and after the Russian invasion, creating a powerful sense of violation and resilience. Another exhibit, "AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego," allows viewers to be analyzed by AI, offering a glimpse into AI's judgmental capabilities. The program includes other immersive representations of culture, such as "Uncharted," which combines footage of a dancer with pan-African language and storytelling, and "The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars," which creates a memorial to enslaved people at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that corporate leaders are increasingly optimistic about the U.S. economy, with most CEOs not expecting a recession this year. The June poll by Chief Executive found that only 28% of business leaders anticipate a near-term recession, a significant drop from 46% in May. CEOs are optimistic that the Trump administration will negotiate trade deals that mitigate the impact of tariffs. However, the World Bank forecasts U.S. economic growth of 1.4% for 2025, citing tariff risks, although recent measures of job growth and consumer spending suggest the economy is currently holding up.
