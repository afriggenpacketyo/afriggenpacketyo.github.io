          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the new U.S. tariff schedule, which offered lower rates than initially feared. Cambodia's prime minister praised the reduction from 49% to 19% as beneficial for his country's economy, while Thailand's finance minister noted its 19% rate reflects a strong U.S. partnership. Taiwan faces a temporary 20% tariff, down from 32%, with its president expressing hope for further reductions through ongoing negotiations. Japan and Malaysia also saw their rates lowered, providing some economic stability, though officials remain prepared to mitigate potential impacts on local businesses.</p>

Quarterback Trey Lance, competing for the backup position, delivered a strong performance, throwing for 120 yards and two touchdowns. The Chargers' defense also made key plays, including an early interception by rookie Nikko Reed that set up a touchdown. While mistakes are common in the first preseason game, the Lions struggled with multiple fumbles on special teams, giving the Chargers a dominant start to their 2025 campaign.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who were facing the loss of legal status and deportation protections. In her order, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to prove the administration's decision was 'preordained' and potentially motivated by racial animus, citing comments from the president. TPS is a program that offers temporary safe haven to immigrants from countries affected by conflict or disaster.</p>

          <p>Lindsay Lohan has returned to the big screen alongside Jamie Lee Curtis for 'Freakier Friday,' a sequel to their 2003 hit comedy. At the London premiere, Lohan expressed her excitement to revisit the beloved story, which now sees her character as a mother herself, navigating a 'quadruple body-swap.' Lohan shared that becoming a mother has given her a new perspective on the film's themes and that she feels confident in her return to acting after a decade-long hiatus. Curtis noted that she and Lohan have remained close, and that the film's message of understanding is particularly relevant today.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has called 'his gift to the country.' The $200 million addition, funded by the president and other 'patriot donors,' will be built in place of the current East Wing and is intended to be completed before his term ends. Trump stated that the current White House event spaces are inadequate, forcing large gatherings into tents on the South Lawn, which is problematic in bad weather. This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a stunning debut on the stock market, with its share price soaring 250% on the first day, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. The successful IPO has created massive paper gains for its early venture capital backers, including Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia, who collectively hold stock worth around $24 billion. The blockbuster offering is a significant event for the tech industry, which has seen a slow IPO market since late 2021. The outcome is particularly notable as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was blocked by regulators last year.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Potato Evolved from Ancient Tomato Hybridization</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has revealed that the modern potato evolved from an ancient ancestor of the tomato around 9 million years ago. Researchers solved the long-standing puzzle of the potato's origin by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a hybridization event between a non-tuber-producing Chilean species and an ancient tomato provided the crucial genetic combination for tuber formation. A specific gene from the tomato ancestor signals the plant to create tubers, while a gene from the other parent helps control their growth, demonstrating how interbreeding can spark new evolutionary traits.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its June quarter, with revenue growing 10% to $94 billion and iPhone sales setting a new record for the period. Despite the positive performance and a better-than-expected outlook, the company provided little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, which has tempered investor enthusiasm. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that Apple is significantly increasing its investment in AI and making progress on a more personalized Siri, but offered no firm timeline. The stock remains an AI 'show me' story in a market heavily focused on advancements in the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be the first individual African American honored with a monument on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. The statue, being created by artist Basil Watson, is the result of a bipartisan push by state lawmakers to more fully represent the state's history. Historians celebrate Smalls as a courageous Civil War hero and a champion for civil rights. The monument will stand among existing statues that predominantly honor White men, many with ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era.</p>

          <p>Amazon posted better-than-expected revenue and profit for its second quarter, with sales rising 13% to $167.7 billion. However, the stock fell in after-hours trading as investors were underwhelmed by the modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, and a mixed forecast for the upcoming quarter. While AWS growth was slightly slower than rivals, CEO Andy Jassy cited supply constraints, particularly access to power, as a key challenge for meeting AI demand. The company plans to increase capital expenditures for the rest of the year to support its cloud and logistics networks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Restrict Civil Service Internships to Working-Class Students</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change is part of a ministerial drive to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for the civil service. The move aims to address the underrepresentation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure a broader range of talent is harnessed for government work.</p>
