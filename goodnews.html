          <p>Southeast Asian countries are increasingly looking to Germany and other European nations to diversify their defense partnerships, moving beyond traditional allies like the US and Russia. This shift involves new defense deals, increased joint activities, and the purchase of European weaponry. The Philippines, for example, recently signed a defense cooperation agreement with Germany and is pursuing similar deals with other countries. This diversification is driven by concerns over Chinese actions in the South China Sea and doubts about US security guarantees.</p>
