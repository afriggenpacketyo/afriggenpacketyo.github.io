          <p>President Trump has indicated that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have discussed a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations. The proposed agreement would reportedly involve a group of American investors, including Oracle, acquiring the U.S. business to allow the app to continue operating in the country. However, the ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm remains a significant point of contention. While Trump expressed optimism about closing the deal, statements from Chinese state media and TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, suggest that negotiations are ongoing and no final agreement has been reached.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the system to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but anticipate it will remain over open waters. The storm's current projected track shows it moving north of the Caribbean and away from any landmasses, though it could pass east of Bermuda next week. So far, the hurricane season has been less active than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, many Chinese companies are now focusing on Southeast Asia as a key region for growth. A major trade fair in Nanning is serving as a strategic platform for these exporters to connect with buyers from the region's fast-growing economies. Companies see immense potential in Southeast Asia's large, young consumer base. This strategic shift highlights a broader trend of Chinese businesses diversifying their international footprints and adapting to changing global economic conditions, seeking new avenues for expansion and market penetration.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing procedural flaws in the complaint. The judge ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and filled with language more suited for a political rally than a legal document. The dismissal was not based on the legal merits of the case. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint that adheres to proper legal standards for such a filing.</p>

          <p>Supermodel David Gandy, reflecting on his nearly 25-year career, has voiced serious concerns about the threat artificial intelligence poses to the fashion industry. He is part of a group of over 2,000 models calling on the government to regulate generative AI, which can create human-like images without real people. Gandy fears that using AI models will make photographers, makeup artists, and other professionals redundant, damaging the industry's creative ecosystem. He emphasized the need to protect the tradition of British modeling and the artistry involved in fashion imagery.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multi-billion-pound investments in the UK by American tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google has fueled optimism about the country's potential as an "AI superpower." The article explores whether this influx of U.S. capital can genuinely turn around the UK economy or if it risks making the nation overly dependent on Silicon Valley. While some, like Nvidia's CEO, express surprise at British pessimism, others, including former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, warn that the UK is just picking up "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table" and exporting its best ideas.</p>
