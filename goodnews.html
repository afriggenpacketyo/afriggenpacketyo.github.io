          <p>Growing discontent is emerging in the Tokyo metropolitan area over proposals to construct large data centers in residential zones. Residents are concerned about potential electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light, leading to the scrapping of some projects. In Hino, a planned five-story data center faces opposition due to height restrictions, while Inzai residents worry about a new data center in a prime location. Some municipalities are responding by implementing stricter regulations, highlighting the need for tech companies to build trust with affected communities as demand for data handling increases.</p>

          <p>Enzo Maresca is confident that Liam Delap can handle the pressure of leading Chelsea's attack and believes he has the potential to become England's next number 9. Delap, who recently moved from Ipswich Town for ¬£30 million, is eager to make a strong first impression and compete with Nicolas Jackson for a starting spot. Maresca, who coached Delap at Manchester City's academy, emphasized the importance of hard work and competition for the striker position. Chelsea also intends to sign another winger and has been active in the transfer market since qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Uefa Conference League last month.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales experienced their fastest growth since December 2023, jumping 6.4% year-on-year in May, surpassing analysts' estimates. This increase was partly attributed to the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8%, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, falling short of expectations. The urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, the lowest level since November, but falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, absent a superior proposal. XRG's takeover bid comes as the firm seeks deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions space. (not investment advice)</p>

This move follows media reports of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with police estimating that over 3 million people in the country have gambled online. The government is also expected to enact a law to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.

          <p>China's economic data for May revealed mixed signals, with US tariffs continuing to impact manufacturing and exports, while domestic consumption showed signs of recovery. Retail sales rose by 6.4%, exceeding forecasts, driven by the June 18 online shopping festival and government efforts to boost consumer spending. However, Zhang Yuhan from The Conference Board noted that the strong retail data was likely influenced by holiday effects and consumption-promoting policies. This indicates that while certain sectors are performing well, the overall economic outlook remains uncertain due to external pressures.</p>

          <p>JJ Spaun won the US Open by two shots, overcoming a flooded golf course, a 90-minute rain delay and the brilliance of Robert MacIntyre on a chaotic final day at Oakmont Country Club. Spaun, who needed a par on the last to win his first major, holed an incredible 64-foot birdie putt to win by two on one under. The 34-year-old American climbed the leaderboard, while others faltered in the challenging conditions. Spaun said he never thought he would be holding the trophy and that he didn't know how good he could be.</p>

          <p>Nearly six months after a wildfire devastated the Pacific Palisades, the final evacuation orders have been fully lifted, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. A portion of the neighborhood had remained under evacuation due to hazards like downed wires and toxic debris. The Army Corps of Engineers oversaw the clearing of wreckage from over 3,200 properties, allowing residents and the public to return. Authorities are advising caution due to potential soil contamination, and soil sampling projects have revealed lead and arsenic contamination above California's standards.</p>
