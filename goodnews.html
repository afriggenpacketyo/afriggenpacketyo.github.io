        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK wage growth experienced a slight slowdown over the summer, with average growth at 4.7% in the three months to August, a marginal decrease from July's 4.8%. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.8%, suggesting a stabilizing trend in the UK's job market after a year of volatility. Job vacancies also continued their decline for the 39th consecutive period, with the ONS observing an increase in unemployment predominantly among younger demographics. While private sector earnings growth was at a four-year low, it still surpassed inflation, a factor that economists believe could prevent the Bank of England from cutting interest rates before year-end.

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX successfully completed its 11th Starship test flight from Texas, a significant milestone preceding the launch of a new version equipped for Moon and Mars missions. The Starship upper stage reached the edge of space before splashing down in the Indian Ocean, while its Super Heavy booster executed a controlled entry in the Gulf of Mexico. This achievement follows a history of prior test flights, some ending in explosions, but the recent successes are bolstering confidence in Starship's capabilities. NASA's Artemis program, which relies on a modified Starship as a lunar lander, aims to return humans to the Moon by mid-2027, with refueling still a key testing objective.</p>

          <p>LG Electronics India's market capitalization has surpassed its South Korean parent company's valuation after its shares soared over 45% on its market debut. The Indian subsidiary's initial public offering marked the strongest demand for an Indian IPO since 2008, attracting bids totaling nearly $50 billion and being oversubscribed more than 54 times, largely due to institutional investor interest. This successful listing underscores the immense growth potential within India's electronics and appliances market, which is projected to nearly double by 2029. Industry analysts anticipate LG Electronics India, as a prominent market leader, is well-positioned to capitalize on these significant market tailwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Treinen, following a period of significant struggle, secured his first postseason save in a narrow 2-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series. Despite a rocky ninth inning where he walked a batter and nearly hit another, Treinen managed to get the final out, preserving the Dodgers' lead. This critical save represents a major turning point for the reliever, who had faced difficulties throughout the season and previous playoff appearances. His manager, Dave Roberts, continued to show faith in Treinen, allowing him to step up and contribute meaningfully to the team's postseason journey.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is campaigning for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after losing both his parents to heart conditions. He believes that if he had learned CPR earlier, he might have been able to save his father, who died from cardiac arrest. Cameron's campaign, "Pulse of Life," has already led to CPR being introduced at his own school. Health groups support the initiative, noting that increased CPR confidence could significantly improve the one-in-ten survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The Scottish government has expressed willingness to meet with Cameron and work on expanding CPR education.</p>

          <p>England's national football team is grappling with a notable shortage of reliable strikers beyond captain Harry Kane, a concern highlighted after Ollie Watkins' injury left few clear deputies for an upcoming match against Latvia.

          <p>Former prime minister Rishi Sunak is urgently calling for a targeted prostate cancer screening program in the UK, highlighting its potential to be affordable, deliverable, and life-saving. His advocacy coincides with the UK National Screening Committee's re-evaluation of its prior stance against routine screening. A report from Prostate Cancer Research, supported by Sunak, suggests a program focusing on high-risk men (aged 45-69 with a family history and black men) would cost £25 million annually. While some medical professionals voice concerns about potential overtreatment and associated side effects, Sunak emphasizes that advancements in MRI scanning make targeted screening more effective and safer now.</p>

With only about a quarter of the original work, roughly 250 characters, having survived, the team employed AI to meticulously replicate and expand upon the distinctive stylistic traits and form. This groundbreaking effort resulted in a complete rendition of 919 characters, presented in its full scroll form. The university emphasizes that this project vividly demonstrates the transformative potential of "AI plus culture," allowing traditional calligraphic art to find fresh modes of expression in the digital era.</p>

          <p>A new campaign in the UK is set to encourage driving license applicants to register as blood donors, aiming to significantly increase donor numbers, particularly among younger demographics. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) will integrate a registration link into emails sent after license applications, potentially reaching millions each year. This initiative builds on the success of a similar program for organ donor registration, where 70% of sign-ups occurred through the DVLA prompt. NHS Blood and Transplant hopes this partnership will help alleviate a persistent "challenging" blood shortage, especially for critically needed O negative blood, by engaging new donors aged 17 and above.</p>

This outcome emphasized how substantial financial investment in talent can navigate in-game challenges, contrasting sharply with the Brewers' more modest approach.

Although the bullpen, particularly Roki Sasaki and Blake Treinen, generated late-game tension, the Dodgers ultimately secured the win.

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by a better-than-expected 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts, though its central bank has cautioned about a projected slowdown in 2026. While manufacturing and construction sectors experienced moderation, and services growth also decelerated, the overall Q3 performance was resilient. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates GDP growth will normalize and core inflation will ease in the near term, subsequently rising gradually. Despite the favorable third-quarter results, the MAS maintained unchanged policy settings, indicating a cautious outlook that acknowledges global trade headwinds and a forecasted narrowing of the output gap.
