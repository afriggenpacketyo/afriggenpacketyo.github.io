          <p>A father is being praised for his heroic actions after saving his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Washington's Olympic National Park. The child was bitten by the animal on a popular trail but sustained non-life-threatening injuries and has since been released from the hospital. Witnesses credited the father's quick intervention with saving the child's life during the harrowing encounter. Park rangers later located and euthanized the cougar, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and confirmed there is no further threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has demonstrated its resilience as a blue-chip investment, with its stock performing steadily even amidst trade uncertainty and tariff pressures. A hypothetical $1,000 investment made ten years ago would now be worth over $2,300, assuming dividends were reinvested. While the stock's long-term growth has sometimes trailed the broader S&P 500, its consistent dividends and stable demand make it a favored defensive asset during economic volatility. The company's recent earnings report beat expectations, further solidifying its reputation as a reliable performer in a shaky market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The messaging platform Telegram is rolling out its self-custodial crypto wallet to its 87 million users in the United States. Developed by The Open Platform (TOP) and built on the TON blockchain, the feature is integrated directly into the app's interface, allowing users to send, receive, and manage digital assets seamlessly. The U.S. launch, previously delayed by regulatory concerns, aims to simplify crypto adoption by eliminating the need for separate apps or seed phrases. This move positions Telegram to compete with established platforms like Coinbase and Cash App by leveraging its large user base.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox in a bizarre fashion, winning on a walk-off catcher's interference call with the bases loaded in the 10th inning. With no outs, Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's check swing made contact with the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez. After a review confirmed the interference, Sosa was awarded first base, forcing in the winning run. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971, providing a uniquely memorable conclusion to the contest.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are discussing a potential collaboration on a spaceport focused on suborbital flights, which could revolutionize long-distance travel. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, this technology could shorten the travel time between Houston and Taipei from 14.5 hours to as little as 2.5 hours. Suborbital transport involves a vehicle briefly exiting the Earth's atmosphere before gliding to a runway landing. While still in the experimental phase, the partnership signals a forward-looking approach to transportation and deepens technological ties between the U.S. and Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Wambugu's debut novel, "Lonely Crowds," examines the complexities and potential toxicity of a decades-long friendship between two women, Ruth and Maria. The article follows their relationship from a Catholic school in Rhode Island to the competitive 1990s New York art scene, revealing the secrets and misunderstandings at its core. Wambugu challenges the sentimental myth of childhood friends, instead portraying their bond as a liability built on an uneven dynamic of obsession and rejection. The novel suggests that such an intense connection can prevent individuals from developing a true sense of self, independent of the other.</p>
