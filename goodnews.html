          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four and a half hours, smartphone addiction is a growing concern linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as well as physical ailments. Scientific studies confirm that problematic smartphone use exhibits classic signs of behavioral addiction, including cravings and withdrawal. Experts recommend a multi-faceted approach to combat this dependency, suggesting methods such as removing phones from the bedroom, disabling notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to reduce appeal. Combining these behavioral nudges with other activities like exercise and spending time in nature has been shown to be effective in reducing addiction and improving overall well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, has purchased approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities, signaling a strategic shift toward becoming an investment firm. The company is pursuing a "crypto treasury strategy," aiming to build a reserve of the cryptocurrency to ensure financial independence and protect against what it calls discrimination by financial institutions. This move aligns with the Trump administration's growing focus on digital assets, including the recent signing of the GENIUS Act. The company also plans to acquire more bitcoin and has set aside $300 million for an options strategy involving bitcoin-related securities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by attracting budget-conscious consumers amid industry-wide economic pressures. The company reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, crediting its success to value-driven promotions and new products like its first-ever stuffed crust pizza, which appealed to all income levels. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while other restaurants offer deals on less desirable items, Domino's provides value on products customers actually want. Despite this sales growth, the company's overall earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its investment in its China licensee. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly advocating for Apple to make a significant acquisition in the artificial intelligence sector to solidify its market leadership. Melius analyst Ben Reitzes suggested that purchasing AI search engine startup Perplexity and launching a subscription service could cause Apple's stock to surge. This sentiment is echoed by Jim Cramer, who believes legal pressures, such as the antitrust case against Google that threatens a $20 billion search agreement, make such a move necessary for Apple's business model. The discussion comes as investors anticipate Big Tech earnings and Meta Platforms continues its aggressive talent acquisition in the AI space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the notorious Ecuadorian drug trafficker known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States and pleaded not guilty to multiple charges in a New York court. Macias, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, faces counts of drug and arms trafficking, which could result in a life sentence. His extradition is the first of its kind directly from Ecuador to the U.S. and follows his recapture in June after a 2024 prison escape. U.S. authorities allege his organization smuggled thousands of pounds of cocaine into the country and used violence to control key trafficking routes.</p>

Ofcom suggests that PSBs must work with YouTube to ensure their material, particularly news and children's programming, is easily discoverable. The regulator also proposed that the government should consider legislation to enforce this prominence to help preserve British culture and trusted news sources.</p>
