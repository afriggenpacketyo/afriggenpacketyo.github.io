          <p>Renowned investor Warren Buffett has announced a donation of $6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charitable foundations, continuing his long-standing philanthropic pledge. This latest contribution brings his total donations since 2006 to approximately $60 billion. The largest portion of the nearly 12.4 million Class B shares will go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. This act aligns with Buffett's 2006 commitment to give away the majority of his vast fortune, emphasizing his belief in addressing wealth inequality through private philanthropy.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after likely being bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming at Jones Beach, New York. The incident occurred while she was in waist-deep water, resulting in non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. Although the woman did not see the creature, experts analyzed the bite marks and concluded they were most likely from a young sand tiger shark. Following the event, swimming was temporarily suspended as officials conducted drone searches of the area to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another attempt by former President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated men from the Central Park Five case dismissed. The lawsuit accuses Trump of defamation for statements made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he falsely claimed the men had killed someone and pled guilty. The judge ruled that a Pennsylvania state law designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech does not apply in federal court. The five men were wrongfully convicted in the high-profile 1989 sexual assault of a jogger in Central Park.</p>

          <p>A decade after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, a Maryland couple who were pioneers in the fight for marriage equality are reflecting on the milestone. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage. While their initial court battle was unsuccessful, it helped pave the way for the state to legalize marriage equality in 2012. They express concern over current efforts to overturn these rights, viewing the renewed debate as disheartening and a threat to the safety and equality of LGBTQ people.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has developed a specialized printer that adds braille to beer can labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision workers. The student-designed machine can emboss braille onto plastic labels, a material that commercial printers cannot handle. The invention was created with accessibility in mind, featuring open hardware that allows BISM's low-vision employees to operate it easily.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs, navigating a week marked by significant geopolitical risk and mixed economic signals. The market largely shrugged off fears of escalation after the U.S. entered the Israel-Iran conflict, with a subsequent plunge in oil prices easing concerns about inflation and economic growth. Investor optimism was also fueled by increasing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end. However, a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation reading from the PCE price index adds a note of caution to the outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study of an ancient city in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons found at √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a well-preserved Neolithic settlement. The genetic analysis revealed that where biological connections existed among household members buried together, the lineage was traced through the female line, indicating husbands likely moved into their wives' households. This evidence, along with a preferential treatment for females in grave goods, points to a society where maternal ancestry was key.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of a highway, only to discover it was a case of mistaken identity. A driver on Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County called in what they believed was a tiger cub. An officer dispatched to the scene found not a large feline but a dead hawk. The California Department of Transportation was then notified to remove the deceased bird. The incident serves as a peculiar reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California.</p>

The march proceeded despite a police ban issued under a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. Attendees risked fines and organizers faced potential prison sentences. The large turnout, which included EU officials and MEPs, served as a powerful symbol of civil society's resistance against the government's increasingly restrictive policies targeting the LGBTQ community and fundamental rights.</p>

Norris outpaced the field by over half a second, delivering a lap he described as near perfection. This performance comes after a season hampered by qualifying mistakes, which he attributes to a lack of feeling from his car. Recent upgrades to the McLaren seem to have resolved the issue, placing him in a strong position to challenge his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, who will start in third.</p>
