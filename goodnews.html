          <h2>Judge Rules Trump Executive Order Targeting Law Firm Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 19:07:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order, which sought to penalize the firm for its representation of Hillary Clinton and associations with the Steele Dossier, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions, which the judge deemed an attack on the principles of the American judicial system. The order had called for the suspension of security clearances and limitations on access to federal buildings for employees of the targeted firms.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, opting instead to ship all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change comes after the Trump administration closed a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese-made items to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu stated that pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model and actively recruits U.S. sellers to join the platform. The de minimis exemption, which President Trump called a 'big scam', allowed products worth no more than $800 to enter the United States without import fees.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks experienced a strong rebound, recovering from losses incurred after President Trump's imposition of global tariffs. Major US indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, showed significant gains, fueled by a better-than-expected jobs report and renewed hopes for US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, exceeding analysts' predictions. Beijing's consideration of trade talks with Washington also boosted investor confidence, contributing to the market's positive performance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale parade through Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th celebration and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing and White House involvement have fueled speculation that Trump is using the Army's birthday as an opportunity to stage a grand military parade, similar to one he desired during his first term, which was eventually scrapped due to high costs.</p>

          <p>George H. Ryan, the former Illinois governor who imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in 2000, citing concerns about wrongful convictions, has died at the age of 91. Ryan, a Republican, defended his decision to suspend the death penalty as an act of conscience, noting that the state's capital punishment system had a 'shameless record of convicting innocent people'. Despite facing criticism from law-and-order groups, Ryan later commuted the sentences of all 167 inmates on death row in Illinois. His actions drew praise from world leaders, including Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela.</p>

          <p>15-year-old Benjamin Qin Muji won a philosophy competition by arguing that artificial intelligence (AI) can think and is therefore conscious, but cannot feel pain because it lacks a biological body. He reasoned that AI's ability to process information and synthesize new ideas indicates consciousness. Benjamin's essay reflects the growing debate about the legal and ethical implications of advanced AI and the evolving definition of what it means to be human in the age of technology.</p>

This raises concerns about the privacy and security of messages, as the TeleMessage version could undermine Signal's end-to-end encryption.</p>
