          <p>Zack Cozart, a former Cincinnati Reds shortstop, retracted his previous criticism of President Trump's plan to intervene in Iran and strike the country's nuclear facilities following the announcement of a ceasefire agreement. Cozart had initially stated he would no longer support the president if the U.S. became involved in a war with Iran and Israel, but he later expressed his trust in Trump after the ceasefire was reached. Auburn Tigers men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl suggested that Trump should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the deal. Trump addressed the conflict, expressing dissatisfaction with both Israel and Iran for their actions, before heading to a NATO summit.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, indicating that policymakers are likely to maintain the current stance until there is greater clarity on the impact of tariffs on prices. Powell acknowledged the strong economic growth and near-full employment but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the effects of President Trump's tariffs, stating that policy changes continue to evolve. Powell's cautious approach could further escalate tensions with Trump, who has been openly critical of Powell's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses how much a $400,000 annuity might pay monthly if purchased at age 70, considering factors like gender, life expectancy, interest rates, and the type of annuity chosen. It explains that men typically receive higher monthly payments than women due to differences in life expectancy. The article also distinguishes between single life and joint life annuities, noting that joint life annuities provide continued payments to a surviving spouse but at a lower monthly rate. It advises maximizing income by opting for a single-life annuity, locking in rates when they are favorable, and avoiding optional riders. (not investment advice)</p>

The film follows a 12-year-old boy named Spike as he navigates a world quarantined from the rage virus, encountering various characters and horrors.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Russia's president only understands force and that the NATO summit aims to secure peace in Europe. Merz announced that Germany would contribute its fair share to European defense, as NATO leaders commit to spending 3.5% of national output on defense and 1.5% on related infrastructure. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte urged European members to focus on defense investment and supporting Ukraine, while minimizing concerns about U.S. commitment. NATO member states are expected to approve a major new investment plan.</p>
