        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave announced plans to sell $1.5 billion in bonds, with the capital intended for general corporate purposes and debt repayment. The move follows a previous $2 billion debt offering in May that was significantly oversubscribed, highlighting strong investor confidence in the company's expansion. CoreWeave, which serves major clients like Nvidia and Microsoft, has seen its stock price more than triple since its public debut in March. The company is also undertaking major projects, including a new $6 billion AI data center in Pennsylvania, though some investors remain concerned about its high debt levels.

          <p>Starbucks has confirmed that its highly popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) will return to stores on August 26, marking a significant cultural and business moment for the coffee giant. The fall menu will also feature returning favorites and a new item, the Pecan Cortado, as part of a broader strategy to boost lagging sales and increase store traffic. The annual PSL launch has become a major revenue driver for Starbucks since its introduction in 2003, creating a widespread trend in pumpkin spice-flavored products across the food industry. The company hopes these seasonal offerings will help reverse a recent decline in same-store sales.</p>

          <h2>Design Software Company Figma Aims for up to $16.4 Billion Valuation in Upcoming IPO</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:01:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has updated its IPO prospectus, revealing plans to raise up to $1 billion by selling shares priced between $25 and $28 each. This could result in a fully diluted valuation of up to $16.4 billion, surpassing its previous $12.5 billion valuation from a 2024 tender offer. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles. Figma's public offering is a notable event in a relatively slow tech IPO market, with the company reporting strong revenue growth and the addition of prominent tech leaders to its board.

          <p>Garris Fabrics & Fashion, a 78-year-old family-owned seamstress shop in West Philadelphia, has been given a new lease on life with a complete storefront renovation. The makeover, which included modern signage and lighting, was funded by a city grant program aimed at revitalizing the 60th Street business corridor. The shop, founded in 1947, continues to handcraft dresses for young girls, a tradition started by the owner's parents. Owner Denise Garris, a retired teacher, has fought to keep the legacy business afloat and hopes the improvements will help secure its future for the next generation of her family.</p>

          <p>A Catholic church in Chicago recently hosted a significant relic—a piece of the heart—of Carlo Acutis, a 15-year-old Italian boy who is set to become the first millennial saint. Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006, was a computer enthusiast who used his skills to create websites cataloging religious miracles, earning him the nickname "patron saint of the internet." The visit of the relic, brought by an archbishop from Italy, drew believers to St. Hedwig Church. His story is seen as a modern example of holiness, demonstrating how faith can be lived out in the digital age.</p>

          <p>This article explains a common misconception among taxpayers: filing for a tax extension does not postpone the deadline for paying taxes owed to the IRS. While an extension grants more time to submit the final paperwork, typically until mid-October, the payment itself is still due by the original April 15 deadline. Failing to pay on time results in penalties and interest charges, even with an approved filing extension. The article advises taxpayers to estimate their liability and pay as much as possible by the deadline to minimize extra charges and outlines options for those who cannot afford their full tax bill.

England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and can secure a series victory with a win in Manchester.

The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a "planning judgment rationally exercised."
