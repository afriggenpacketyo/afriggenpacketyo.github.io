          <p>President Trump's military parade, costing an estimated $45 million, had a lower-than-anticipated turnout. The event, ostensibly celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, coincided with Trump's birthday and numerous "No Kings" protests across the country.  The article contrasts the parade's relatively low attendance with the significant participation in the anti-Trump protests. The article notes the irony of the parade's timing given the context.</p>
