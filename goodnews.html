        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, marking a triumphant return after being banned from the previous year's event. Chestnut consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes to secure his victory, falling short of his own 2021 world record of 76. The win comes after a one-year hiatus due to a partnership dispute with a rival brand. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th title by eating 33 hot dogs and buns, though this was significantly below her record-setting performance from the prior year.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, asserting that it fundamentally "turned the world upside down." In an interview, Burns argued that the revolution's greatest contribution was the creation of the "citizen," a new concept in a world previously composed of subjects under rulers. He emphasized that the Declaration of Independence, despite its original exclusionary language, provided an inspirational foundation for future movements for equality worldwide. Burns's upcoming film on the subject aims to explore these complex and rich historical narratives.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation Eliminates Federal Income Tax on Tips for Many Workers</h2>

          <p>A provision in a major new budget package signed by President Trump will eliminate federal income taxes on tips for many service industry workers, such as restaurant servers and bartenders. The legislation creates a new deduction for tipped income, though workers will still be responsible for state, local, and payroll taxes. The tax cut is set to expire in 2028 unless extended by a future Congress. While the White House promotes it as a benefit for the working class, critics argue it will not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal income tax liability.

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed holding a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebration next year. During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 spectators for the July 4th event. He stated that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would organize the fight. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major professional sporting event has been hosted at the White House.</p>

          <p>England's Jamie Smith and Harry Brook led a remarkable fightback on the third day of the second Test against India, though the tourists remain in a dominant position. Smith scored an impressive 184 not out, while Brook added 158, forming a 303-run partnership that rescued England from a precarious 85-5. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, stormed back with the new ball, causing a late collapse as England was all out for 407. India ended the day with a substantial overall lead of 244, setting the stage for a compelling conclusion to the match.</p>

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for a record 10% of all new vehicles sold in the UK in June, a significant increase from 6% a year prior. The surge, driven by brands like BYD and MG, comes as other Western countries are imposing heavy tariffs on Chinese automotive imports. Analysts attribute the growth to the UK's lack of similar tariffs, the popularity of electric vehicles, and the competitive pricing and innovation of Chinese models. While this trend benefits consumers, some industry leaders have expressed concern about the ability of the UK's domestic auto industry to compete long-term.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into mainstream finance, with major institutions building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced it would allow European users to trade tokenized U.S. stocks via an Ethereum-based network, while Deutsche Bank is developing a tokenization platform on a similar system. This shift toward utility and infrastructure is driving institutional adoption, as firms value Ethereum's stability and security for handling financial transactions. Despite price volatility, the focus on building the back-end for global finance signals a new phase of maturation for the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Miami's iconic reefs, scientists are transplanting fragments of crossbred corals onto a reef that was devastated by bleaching two years ago. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and partners in Florida and Honduras, involves breeding native Florida Elkhorn corals with corals from a warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to introduce greater genetic diversity and thermal tolerance, helping the reef ecosystem become more resilient to rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change. This marks the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild.</p>
