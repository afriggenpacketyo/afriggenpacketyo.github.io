          <h2>UK Energy Bills Set to Decrease Amidst Persistent Financial Strain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 03:26:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year for approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This translates to an annual saving of about ¬£129 for a typical household, driven by a fall in international wholesale gas prices. While this offers some relief, charities emphasize that many individuals continue to struggle with energy costs, collectively owing around ¬£4 billion to suppliers. Dame Clare Moriarty from Citizens Advice stresses the need for targeted support for vulnerable populations and investments in energy efficiency measures, as high bills have led to significant customer debt to suppliers.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is expected to stop making new pennies after President Donald Trump ordered the end of their production, citing the coin's wastefulness. The US Treasury anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs once the penny is no longer minted. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny costs almost four cents to produce, leading advocates to call for its abolition. Jay Zagorsky, a professor at Boston University, supports the move but advises Congress to legislate the rounding of prices to eliminate demand for the coin.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, reversing an earlier decision to halt the classes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had initially paused on-site classes, citing that the government would no longer pay for travel for programs it did not deem "mission critical". However, FEMA reversed course after a comprehensive review, stating that certain courses provide effective training. The decision marks a reprieve for Emmitsburg, where the academy is a vital part of the town's identity and economy.</p>

          <p>Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett has agreed to donate $50,000 to a Chicago charity to settle a lawsuit filed by the city. The lawsuit sought restitution for the cost of investigating Smollett's claims that he was the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. Smollett was convicted in 2021 on charges accusing him of staging the incident, but the conviction was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on double jeopardy grounds. The settlement involves Smollett making the donation to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts.</p>

          <p>With Japan's aging population, a growing number of seniors are turning to charitable giving after death, particularly bequest donations to hospitals and nonprofits. This trend is driven by the increasing number of childless couples and unmarried individuals with no heirs. Awareness about bequest donations has risen, with more organizations facilitating connections between donors and recipients through wills and trusts. Readyfor Inc., a crowdfunding service provider, has been mediating bequest donations since 2021, assisting donors in choosing beneficiaries and providing expertise in inheritance-related matters.</p>
