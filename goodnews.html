          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations of a 0.1% decrease. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned about potential economic moderation due to global trade policies, particularly those of the United States. Despite these concerns, some BOJ board members suggest the central bank might continue to raise policy rates if inflation targets are met, while others advise caution due to economic uncertainty.

The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, raising concerns among experts about the future of vaccine infrastructure. Some experts fear that these new limits are the first steps in undermining the use of all vaccines, including childhood immunizations.</p>
