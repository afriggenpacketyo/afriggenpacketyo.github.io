        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decision-making. Diller emphasizes that relying solely on data can be detrimental, as it focuses on past events rather than future possibilities. He argues that too much information can complicate and obscure the essence of an idea, which should be evaluated based on its inherent quality and common sense. Diller recounts instances where trusting his instincts led to successful projects like 'Brian's Song' and 'The Night Stalker,' highlighting the value of simple human instinct in the entertainment industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK will end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce visas for lower-skilled workers, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The government plans to change visa and recruitment laws, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government expects these measures to reduce the number of lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK by up to 50,000 over the next year. The move aims to address net migration, which has been a challenge for successive governments, and will also include new training commitments to help unemployed individuals re-enter the UK labor market.</p>

While the idea is presented tongue-in-cheek, it serves as a comedic tribute to fathers and their contributions.
