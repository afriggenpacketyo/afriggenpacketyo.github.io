          <p>London Stansted Airport faced significant delays on Sunday morning due to an IT issue that affected check-in, baggage handling, and security systems. Passengers reported long queues stretching outside the terminal building, with some missing their flights as a result. The airport acknowledged the problem on X, stating that engineers were working to resolve the issue and advising passengers to stay in contact with their airlines for updates. While the IT problem was eventually resolved, residual delays continued to affect both arrivals and departures throughout the morning. The incident caused considerable disruption and frustration for travelers at the Essex airport.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico are nearing a potential agreement to permanently resolve the decades-long sewage crisis affecting waters off the coast of San Diego. EPA chief Lee Zeldin announced that a proposed '100% solution' has been transmitted to Mexico, with technical groups from both nations scheduled to meet and work out the details. The sewage problem, exacerbated by Tijuana's growing population and outdated infrastructure, has threatened San Diego's tourism industry, posed a national security risk to Navy SEAL training, and caused illnesses among residents. The proposed solution aims to update infrastructure and water management facilities to stop the flow of sewage into U.S. waters and clean up existing contamination.</p>

A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing concerns that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated.

Supporters, including Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, celebrated Ozturk's release and emphasized the importance of protecting free speech and due process rights.

A recent survey revealed that many business leaders who laid off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their jobs now regret the decision. While AI platforms enhance search capabilities, they are not reliable enough to handle core business operations without human oversight. Small and mid-sized businesses face challenges in implementing AI due to technology limitations, data security concerns, and high costs, making widespread job replacement unlikely in the near future.</p>

          <p>Argentine boxer Fernando Martinez retained the WBA super flyweight belt after a 12-round fight with Japanese former champion Kazuto Ioka. Martinez won by unanimous decision in a rematch of their July 2024 bout, where Martinez initially took the belt from Ioka. Despite Ioka flooring Martinez with a left hook in the 10th round, he was unable to overcome the deficit on the scorecards. With the loss, Ioka's record now stands at 31 wins, 4 losses, and 1 draw, while Martinez improved to 18-0.</p>
