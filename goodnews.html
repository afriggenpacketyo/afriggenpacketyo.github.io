          <p>Northampton Saints secured a surprising 37-34 victory over Leinster in the Investec Champions Cup semi-final at Aviva Stadium. Alex Mitchell's post-match comments reflected the team's aggressive approach, defying expectations and overcoming last year's defeat. Tommy Freeman's hat-trick highlighted Saints' offensive prowess, while Leinster struggled to maintain their usual clinical edge. A late penalty awarded to Leinster was overturned, allowing Northampton to secure the win with a turnover on their own line. The victory marks a significant achievement for Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson, who emphasized the team's belief despite being considered underdogs.</p>
