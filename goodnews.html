On the court, Chicago's Angel Reese delivered a dominant performance with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle. Despite a second-half surge from Los Angeles, the Sky closed out the game in the fourth quarter to secure the win on the memorable occasion.</p>

          <p>Colorado Rockies interim manager Warren Schaeffer was ejected for the first time in his career during a game against the Brewers, reacting with a memorable display of passion. After his player was tossed for arguing a strike call, Schaeffer stormed from the dugout, spiked his hat, and vehemently argued with the umpire. The fiery display, which included him drawing a line in the dirt to show the pitch's location, seemed to galvanize his team. The Rockies, who have MLB's worst record, went on to rally and ultimately defeated Milwaukee 4-3 in extra innings.</p>

Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm and welcoming reception.

          <p>Vin Diesel has indicated that the late Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, could return for the planned final installment of the 'Fast & Furious' franchise. Walker, who died in 2013, last appeared in 'Furious 7' through a combination of archived footage, digital effects, and his brothers acting as stand-ins. Speaking at an event, Diesel said he told Universal Studios that one of his conditions for the finale was to reunite the characters of Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner. The potential return highlights the ongoing debate surrounding posthumous digital performances in major film franchises.</p>

          <p>A contentious proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant bipartisan backlash from lawmakers and conservation groups who feared the privatization of federal lands. Lee stated he withdrew the measure because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests. The removal marks a victory for public land advocates, though they remain wary of future attempts to sell federal lands.</p>
