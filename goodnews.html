          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a more positive public perception of investing in stocks and shares to help stimulate the nation's economy. In a speech to financial leaders, she argued the current narrative focuses too heavily on risks, preventing savers from contributing to and benefiting from economic growth. The government plans to work with regulators to introduce new support systems for potential investors, aiming to shift funds from cash savings accounts into UK companies as part of a broader strategy to ignite growth.

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite designated NWA 16788, with an expected price between $2 million and $4 million. Weighing over 54 pounds, this meteorite represents a significant portion of all known Martian material on our planet. It was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. The sale highlights the rarity and scientific value of such objects, which offer insights into the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, averting a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods. Under the deal, the U.S. will impose a lower 19% tariff in exchange for Indonesia providing "full access" for American firms and lowering its own tariffs on U.S. products. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has reportedly committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing aircraft. This pact is the latest development in the administration's ongoing global trade negotiations.</p>
