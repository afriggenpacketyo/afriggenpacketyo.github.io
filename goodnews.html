          <p>Despite mortgage rates reaching their highest point since January, homebuyer demand increased by 2% compared to the previous week and 18% year-over-year.  This surge is attributed to increased housing inventory in many markets, supporting transaction volume despite economic uncertainty.  According to an MBA economist, purchase applications are outpacing last year's figures.  The increase in purchase applications contrasts with a 7% decrease in refinance applications for the week.</p>

The author contends that materialism, while valuable in some contexts, is insufficient for understanding the complex factors driving far-right populism.  The author proposes a postmaterialist explanation focusing on the disruption of traditional social orders by egalitarian democratic progress, leading to a surge in far-right support. This shift in perspective challenges the left to adopt a more nuanced understanding of political behavior.</p>
