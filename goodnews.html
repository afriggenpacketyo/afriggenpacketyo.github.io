          <p>WWE's recent events in Los Angeles, including Worlds Collide featuring AAA stars and Money in the Bank, have garnered mixed reactions. Worlds Collide broke viewership records and celebrated Mexican wrestling, while Money in the Bank was criticized for its match outcomes and left some fans disappointed. The return of Ron Killings (R-Truth) at Money in the Bank was a welcomed surprise, potentially saving the event from further criticism. The events showcased WWE's evolving approach to integrating diverse wrestling styles and storylines, but the reception highlights the challenges of satisfying a broad fanbase. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves calls it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth and enhance energy security. However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C condemns the announcement, fearing it will add to consumer bills and prove a costly mistake. The project faces opposition due to its potential environmental impact and concerns over value for money, while the government insists nuclear power is vital for a low-carbon energy future. </p>

          <p>In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect civil rights advocates marching from Selma to Montgomery, marking a rare instance of a president taking control of a state's National Guard without the governor's cooperation. This action followed Governor George Wallace's refusal to ensure the safety of the marchers. Johnson's decision highlights the use of federal power to uphold civil rights and enforce federal laws. The historical context provides a contrast to current events involving the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. </p>
