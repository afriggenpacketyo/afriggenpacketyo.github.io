          <p>Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller, "It Was Just an Accident," won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant win for a director previously banned from leaving Iran.

          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, facing scrutiny over his mental health and attendance record, says he feels unfairly shamed into fulfilling senatorial duties he considers 'performative'. In an interview, Fetterman explained that media outlets have 'weaponized' his absenteeism to portray him as mentally unfit, a consequence of his openness about his mental health struggles. He acknowledged missing votes to spend time with his family and expressed frustration over the structure of Senate hearings. Fetterman, who has embraced Mounjaro for weight loss and mental clarity, also noted his pro-Israel stance has given him a sense of purpose, while some colleagues worry about his isolation.</p>
