          <h2>Public and Market Support Grows for Nuclear Energy Amid Rising Power Demands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 09:40:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the renewed interest in nuclear energy in the United States, highlighted by the recommissioning of plants like Palisades in Michigan. This resurgence is largely driven by the massive electricity demands of AI and data centers, leading tech giants like Microsoft and Google to invest in nuclear power. The development of smaller, factory-built Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) is presented as a key future solution, despite ongoing debates about their cost, regulatory hurdles, and deployment timeline. Public opinion is shifting, with a growing majority now supporting nuclear power, signaling a potential transformation in the nation's energy landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, reflects on his life and career in a recent interview and his new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout." He discusses his evolution from a 1960s pop superstar to his conversion to Islam, a decision that led him to step away from music for nearly three decades after being misinformed that it was forbidden. The artist also addresses a past controversy regarding comments about Salman Rushdie, attributing them to a misguided attempt at British humor on a serious topic. Now performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, he views the combined name as a complete picture of his identity, with his songs serving as a biographical map of his journey.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Tone of Voice as the Primary Source of Conflict in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 09:36:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Dr. Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments among couples is not money or chores, but the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate potential conflicts by becoming more self-aware; if a harsh tone is used, one should pause, apologize, and rephrase their statement. For the person on the receiving end, it is recommended to calmly point out the problematic tone and ask their partner to try again, thereby interrupting a negative cycle before it escalates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under its new "eco-populist" leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is experiencing a surge in membership and adopting a more confrontational political style. Polanski's strategy involves "picking fights" to gain public attention, a tactic aimed at converting the party's momentum into tangible votes and seats in Parliament. This shift reflects a broader strategy to appear as an insurgent force rather than just well-meaning activists, drawing inspiration from the simple messaging and provocative approach of parties like Reform UK. However, some members worry that this new boldness could alienate the rural voters who were key to their previous electoral breakthroughs.</p>

          <h2>Schools Implementing Cellphone Bans Report Increased Student Engagement and Social Interaction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 09:14:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>High schools across the United States are increasingly implementing "bell-to-bell" cellphone bans to address classroom distractions and improve student focus. At Jericho High School in New York, students initially experienced separation anxiety but have since reported greater engagement in class discussions and a newfound interest in subjects they previously found boring. The policy has also led to a more vibrant social environment, with the school cafeteria becoming noticeably louder as students talk to each other instead of looking at their screens. While some parents expressed concern about being unable to contact their children, school officials maintain that the ban fosters crucial communication skills and helps students live more in the moment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that a potential peace deal between Israel and Hamas is the closest the parties have come to securing the release of all hostages from Gaza. While expressing optimism, he cautioned that significant challenges and potential pitfalls remain, and that key technical details of the plan proposed by President Trump still need to be finalized. Mediators are scheduled to convene in Egypt to advance the negotiations, with a U.S. team present. Rubio stressed the urgency of the situation, stating that the first phase of releasing the hostages must happen quickly for the rest of the deal to gain momentum and succeed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the request of President Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering a rule change that would end the requirement for public companies to file quarterly reports, shifting to a semi-annual schedule. The proposal aims to reduce costs and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term earnings pressure. While this could save companies significant money, it poses a major threat to the revenue of the 'Big Four' accounting firms, which could lose a substantial portion of their audit business. The move could also encourage more private companies to go public by lowering the regulatory burden, potentially offsetting some of the accounting firms' losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge asserts that the single most important rule for parents in the digital age is to prohibit electronic devices in their children's bedrooms overnight. She argues this is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for the physical and mental health of developing brains. Research shows that late-night device use is a primary cause of insufficient sleep among adolescents, a factor linked to depression, anxiety, and poor emotional regulation. Twenge advises parents to be firm in implementing this rule, even with older teens, by transparently explaining that the decision is based on new knowledge about the importance of sleep for their well-being.</p>

The law also reinstates the ability for companies to immediately deduct 100% of their domestic research and development (R&D) costs, reversing a previous rule that required these expenses to be amortized over time. Additionally, the bill revives a more generous calculation for deducting business loan interest and makes the popular 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent.

          <p>Recent tax legislation signed by President Trump could change how Americans approach their year-end charitable giving. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, allowing them to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers, which may incentivize delaying smaller donations until then. Conversely, for higher earners, the law will introduce a new floor and cap on the charitable deduction in 2026, potentially reducing its value. This could encourage wealthy donors to accelerate their giving into the current year, possibly by using tools like donor-advised funds to "bunch" several years of contributions.
