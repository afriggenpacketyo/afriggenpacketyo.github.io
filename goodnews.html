          <p>Five current or former Iowa State football coaching staff members have been punished by the NCAA for sports gambling violations, including wagering on the school's basketball programs. The coaches collectively placed over 6,200 online bets totaling more than $100,000, leading to Level II violations that could compromise the integrity of collegiate athletics. The penalties include a one-year show-cause order, attendance at an NCAA Regional Rules Seminar, and a two-week suspension for any future hires. The investigation stemmed from a state inquiry into sports wagering activities at campus athletic facilities, revealing dozens of athletes involved in underage gambling and identity theft.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Recovers After Tariff-Induced Sell-Off, but Concerns Linger</h2>

          <p>Wall Street has largely rebounded from the sharp sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements in early April, fueled by renewed hopes for trade talks with China. The S&P 500 has climbed back to pre-tariff levels, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected jobs report. However, despite the recent optimism, the market remains below its February high, and questions persist about the long-term economic impact of the administration's trade policies. While some tariffs have been temporarily paused, new taxes on imports, particularly from China, are taking effect, raising concerns about slower economic growth and potential pullbacks in corporate hiring and investment. The volatility underscores the market's sensitivity to the ongoing trade tensions and their potential fallout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu, the bargain Chinese retailer, has stopped shipping directly from China to the U.S. after the de minimis tariff loophole was cut off, as a result of an executive order signed by President Trump. This loophole allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free. Temu has shifted its website and app to feature only products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses, with items previously shipped from China now labeled as out of stock. This change forces Temu to alter its business model and circumvent higher levies, raising prices and suspending its aggressive advertising. Temu states that pricing for U.S. shoppers remains unchanged as they actively recruit U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>Gregg Popovich has stepped down as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs after 29 seasons, transitioning to the role of president of basketball operations. Popovich, 76, holds the record for most regular-season victories by an NBA head coach and led the Spurs to five NBA championships. Mitch Johnson, who served as acting head coach during Popovich's leave of absence, will take over as head coach. Popovich arrived in San Antonio in 1988 as an assistant coach and returned as head coach in 1996, becoming the longest-serving active coach in any major US sport.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite occasional public criticism, the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News remains strong due to mutual need. Trump treats Fox News as a political instrument, using it to amplify his messages and attack perceived enemies. Fox News, in turn, benefits from Trump's high profile and the attention he brings to the network. The show Fox & Friends serves as both a platform for friendly interviews and a way for White House officials to communicate directly with the president. While Trump may flirt with other networks, he consistently returns to Fox News, highlighting the enduring utility of their partnership.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing. The stake would be worth about $4.8 billion at the current price. The disclosure follows Amazon's first-quarter earnings report late Thursday. While profit and revenue topped estimates, the company's forecast for operating income in the current quarter came in below Wall Street's expectations. Bezos previously offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon shares last year, marking his first sale of company stock since 2021. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's remedies trial in the Google antitrust case regarding its advertising tech is scheduled to begin on Sept. 22.

This follows an August ruling that Google has held a monopoly in its core market of internet search, the most-significant antitrust ruling in the tech industry since the case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.</p>

A low-pressure system moving eastward is expected to bring a risk of showers and thunderstorms to the mountains, with potential for flash flooding and debris flows. Coastal areas could see light rain or drizzle, and temperatures are expected to dip to the 60- to 70-degree range, about 10 degrees below normal. Wind gusts of 25 to 45 mph could occur in coastal areas, with stronger conditions over the Central Coast and southwest Santa Barbara.</p>
