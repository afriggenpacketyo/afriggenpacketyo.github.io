He rents a two-bedroom apartment in a high-rise for $850, a fraction of what a similar lifestyle would cost in the United States. Ryan, who was honorably discharged in 2019, supports himself through VA disability benefits, the GI Bill, and teaching English. He contrasts the financial pressures and lack of motivation he felt in the U.S. with his current ability to focus on personal happiness and growth in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>After more than 20 years of extensive renovation, the tomb of Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings is now open to the public. The large tomb, discovered in 1799, belongs to a prominent pharaoh who ruled during the 18th Dynasty. The Japanese-led restoration project focused on preserving wall paintings depicting the pharaoh and ancient gods, as well as inscriptions from the Book of the Dead. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader strategy to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency for the nation.</p>

          <p>Dawon Matthews, who struggled to find employment due to a felony charge from his youth, has become a successful entrepreneur with five companies, including a Houston food truck that generates over $1 million in annual revenue. After facing constant rejection from the corporate world despite earning a college degree, he started a cleaning company and a junk removal service. He used the profits to invest in real estate and eventually launched Goodies Soul Kitchen, which found a niche in Houston's late-night food scene. Matthews is now committed to hiring other formerly incarcerated individuals, offering them opportunities based on their skills rather than their records.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher recounted leaving a successful management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online bookstore called Amazon, a move Bill Gates called "the stupidest decision." Risher was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's powerful vision, which included an obsession with the customer experience and a bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000. Bezos's confidence in expanding from books to an "everything store" and the opportunity to be part of such rapid growth was too compelling for Risher to pass up. Amazon ultimately surpassed that goal a year early, hitting $1.6 billion in revenue in 1999.</p>

She writes on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to process her own feelings and show her children that love is constant.

          <p>Taylor Swift's new song "Actually Romantic" has fueled fan theories that it is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song references another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie," which fans have linked to Charli XCX's track "Sympathy is a Knife." In a new film accompanying her album, Swift explained the song is "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the intense negative attention flattering. While neither artist has confirmed the subject of their respective songs, the new track has reignited speculation about a rivalry between the two stars.</p>

Despite Workiva's strong market position and high customer retention, Irenic points to its lack of profitability and bloated sales and marketing expenses as key issues. The activist firm is seeking two new board seats to oversee these proposed reforms and unlock shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Urenco USA, the only commercial uranium enrichment facility in the United States, is expanding its New Mexico plant to meet a projected surge in demand. This growth is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a renewed push for nuclear power, alongside a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports set for 2028. The facility, which currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand, is increasing its capacity by 15% to help fill the supply gap left by Russia. The expansion highlights the pivotal moment for the nuclear industry as it races to build out a domestic supply chain to support ambitious energy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate, savers are facing the end of an era of high yields on cash accounts. Financial advisors suggest that while rates on high-yield savings accounts may decline, options like certificates of deposit (CDs) can lock in current rates for a set term. As of early October, some CDs still offer rates over 4% for terms of one to two years. Other safe, liquid options for parking cash include Treasury bills, which offer tax advantages, and money market funds, which provide slightly higher yields than traditional checking accounts while maintaining easy access.

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. A hard-line conservative and protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. Her election is a historic moment for a country with low gender equality in politics, though her conservative views and regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine could create diplomatic friction with neighboring countries. As leader, she will face immediate challenges including rising prices and navigating complex diplomatic and security issues, including strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early-stage form of the disease after she advocated for early screening. Despite having no symptoms, she pushed for a mammogram at age 36, which then led to a breast MRI that revealed two suspicious masses. Her oncologist credits her self-advocacy with catching the cancer when it was highly treatable, as the five-year survival rate drops significantly in later stages. The case underscores the need for individuals, especially those with higher risk factors, to be aware of their family history and discuss personalized screening plans with their doctors.</p>

Goodall often stated that she immediately felt better and lighter after making the switch and encouraged others to do the same for planetary and personal health.

          <p>The late primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of its place in the natural world. Her journey began in the 1960s when, with no formal scientific training, she immersed herself in the lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Her groundbreaking observation of chimps, like David Greybeard, making and using tools shattered the long-held belief that this was a uniquely human trait. This discovery forced a redefinition of what it means to be human and fostered a deeper connection and sense of empathy between humans and other species, inspiring decades of conservation work.</p>

Koerner expedited the process by using his own funds instead of waiting for insurance, being tenacious with government agencies, and keeping his new home's design simple.

          <p>The long-held belief in the enduring prestige of elite universities is being challenged as families increasingly prioritize practical considerations like cost, career outcomes, and hands-on learning. With soaring tuition and a tough job market, parents are questioning if a brand-name degree is worth the price, leading to more fluidity in college rankings. Schools like Northeastern University have risen in prominence by focusing on unique offerings like co-op programs, attracting students concerned with job placement over pedigree. This shift reflects a broader reevaluation of a college degree's worth, with more families measuring a school's value by what it delivers rather than the status it represents.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Israeli official, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have halted offensive operations in the Gaza Strip. This pause is intended to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages as outlined in a U.S.-proposed peace plan, though it is not considered an official ceasefire. Israel maintains it will not allow Hamas to exploit the halt to regroup or carry out attacks. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to begin Sunday in Egypt, which will serve as a crucial test of Hamas's readiness to accept the ceasefire proposal.</p>
