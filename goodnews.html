          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 07:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peaches are being highlighted by nutrition experts as a top summer fruit for hydration and overall health. Composed of about 89% water, they are a significant source of hydration and contain essential electrolytes like potassium, which supports nerve function, heart health, and fluid balance. The fruit is also rich in antioxidants such as flavonoids and carotenoids, which are linked to a lower risk of heart disease, improved cognitive function, and anti-inflammatory properties. For those monitoring sugar intake, experts recommend pairing peaches with protein or healthy fats to help stabilize blood sugar levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions and concerns about the U.S. dollar, affluent investors are significantly increasing their allocation to gold, with some holdings doubling this year. The demand is driven by the metal's traditional role as a safe-haven asset, attracting investors in Asia, the Middle East, and increasingly, the United States. Investment methods vary, from purchasing fractions of unallocated bars through private banks to storing physical bullions in highly secure vaults like former Swiss military bunkers. While some investors prefer the lower fees of unallocated gold, others opt for owning specific, physical bars for maximum security in uncertain times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to the catastrophic flash floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas earlier this month, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special legislative session. The session will focus on improving the state's emergency preparedness and recovery protocols for future flooding events. Key topics on the agenda include enhancing flood warning systems, improving emergency communications, and securing relief funding for affected communities. This legislative action aims to ensure Texas is better equipped to handle such natural disasters and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>

          <p>China's high-speed rail network has expanded to 48,000 kilometers, putting it on course to meet its year-end goal of 50,000 kilometers. This vast network now accounts for over 70% of the world's total high-speed rail mileage and serves 97% of Chinese cities with populations exceeding 500,000. The announcement comes as national railway passenger trips hit a record 2.24 billion in the first half of 2025, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Officials attribute this growth to a recovering economy, rising travel demand, and significant improvements in service quality and network capacity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed that a national inquiry will be held into the violent clashes between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant in 1984. The confrontation, known as the "Battle of Orgreave," was one of the most contentious events of the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will address the "unanswered questions" that have lingered for over 40 years, examining both the events of the day and the subsequent collapsed prosecutions of 95 miners. Campaigners, who have sought justice for decades, expressed cautious elation at the announcement, hoping it will finally reveal the truth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryanair is considering raising the bonus paid to staff for intercepting passengers with oversized luggage, according to CEO Michael O'Leary. The airline currently pays employees about €1.50 per oversized bag to enforce its strict baggage rules, which O'Leary says are followed by over 99.9% of customers. The move is intended to further discourage passengers from bringing excess baggage, which can cause flight delays. This discussion comes as the European Parliament pushes for standardized free hand luggage allowances, a proposal O'Leary predicts will fail due to limited space on aircraft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive independent review of England and Wales' water sector has recommended a major overhaul, including the dissolution of the economic regulator, Ofwat. The report, led by former Bank of England official Sir Jon Cunliffe, concluded that government, water companies, and regulators all share blame for the sector's current problems, such as sewage spills and rising bills. A key proposal is to create a single, unified water regulator in both England and Wales to streamline accountability. The review also calls for reforming how companies monitor pollution, introducing stricter controls on company ownership, and avoiding sharp bill increases for vulnerable households.</p>

          <p>Housing advocates argue that a simple legislative fix—deleting five words from a 50-year-old federal law—could help alleviate the housing crisis. The law requires all manufactured homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that has become largely obsolete but adds cost and zoning hurdles. Removing this mandate could make these homes more affordable, attractive, and easier to integrate into traditional neighborhoods, potentially boosting production significantly. After decades of languishing due to industry resistance and political inertia, the proposal is gaining new traction in Congress amid intensified pressure to increase the nation's housing supply.</p>
