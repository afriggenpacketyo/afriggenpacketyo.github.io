          <p>Iran announced that it would halt its attacks if Israel reciprocated by 4 a.m. local time, according to Kyodo News. This breaking news suggests a potential de-escalation of the conflict between the two nations, contingent upon Israel's response. The statement comes amidst heightened tensions following recent strikes and counterstrikes in the region, with international actors closely monitoring the situation for any signs of resolution. The offer indicates a possible path towards a ceasefire, though the ultimate outcome remains uncertain given the complex dynamics and historical animosity between Iran and Israel. The geopolitical landscape is tense, and the world watches to see if a ceasefire will materialize. The potential for de-escalation offers a glimmer of hope for regional stability.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, a major inland city in China, is rapidly becoming a global rail hub, linking Asean and EU markets. The city's strategic location and the development of cross-border rail networks provide faster and more reliable access to global markets. These rail routes, including one to Germany and another to Singapore, offer an alternative to traditional sea transport, cutting shipping times by 10 to 20 days. Chongqing aims to become a central node in the global economy, facilitating trade between Asia and Europe. This development reflects China's efforts to deepen its global trade footprint amidst rising geopolitical risks, especially concerning potential decoupling from the United States.</p>

          <p>Speech and Language UK warns that children with speech and language difficulties are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. The charity reports that nearly half of young people referred to mental health services also face serious speech and language challenges. These challenges can include difficulties with learning new words, understanding non-verbal cues, or stammering during speech. The charity advocates for better training in speech and language for teachers, school staff, and mental health professionals to identify and support children with these dual needs. The government has committed to providing access to mental health support in every secondary school in England by 2030.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, characterizing Iran's response to U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak." Trump thanked Iran for the advance warning, which he said allowed for the prevention of casualties. He also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire starting at midnight ET. Diplomatic sources confirmed that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing over the weekend. Trump urged both Iran and Israel to "proceed to Peace and Harmony."</p>

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV test kits to women who have delayed coming forward for cervical screening, aiming to increase participation in the potentially life-saving procedure. The DIY test kits, available from January, allow women to self-sample and test for human papillomavirus, which causes most cervical cancers. The initiative seeks to address barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time that prevent women from attending traditional screenings. The program could increase the proportion of women screened to 77% over three years.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel told CNBC that he doubts Iran will close off the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage. Braziel argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own interests, as the country exports 1.7 million barrels a day through it. He notes that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped on Monday. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are creating issues for exporters, as global customers are becoming more reluctant to buy other energy products.

          <p>Despite President Trump's promise to avoid "never-ending wars," some of his voters support the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While some high-profile supporters accuse Trump of betraying the MAGA movement, others view the strikes as protecting American interests and preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. These voters trust Trump to protect American interests while avoiding a prolonged regional conflict. The responses reflect a mix of support and disappointment, with some emphasizing the need for decisive leadership and others questioning the constitutionality of the military action.</p>

Pilots are trained to choose foods that aid digestion and maintain alertness, such as turkey sandwiches on wheat bread.
