        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that long-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Powell noted significant changes over the past five years, including surging inflation that led to aggressive interest rate hikes. He cautioned that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon and that more frequent and persistent supply shocks pose a challenge for central banks. While he didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged their potential to slow growth and boost inflation, making policy decisions more complex. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may be forced to raise prices. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's trade levies hinder the retailer's ability to maintain low prices due to narrow retail margins. Price hikes are expected to take effect later this month. Additionally, Walmart has withdrawn its quarterly profit outlook due to global economic uncertainty, as Trump aims to secure favorable trade deals with countries facing import levies.</p>

The team's midseason trade for Jimmy Butler aimed to provide additional scoring, but Butler struggled to fill Curry's absence. The Warriors face challenges in adding more offensive talent due to salary cap constraints, making their reliance on Curry's continued performance crucial.</p>
