Klarna is strategically expanding its services into traditional banking, introducing a debit card and personal deposit accounts in the U.S. While the IPO signals strong investor interest, the company navigates potential regulatory challenges, particularly in the U.K., concerning the oversight of its popular BNPL loan products.

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's richest person, with his wealth soaring to $393 billion. This significant increase is primarily due to Oracle's stock surging over 40% after the company provided an optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, securing multibillion-dollar contracts. Ellison, an influential figure and ally of former President Donald Trump, is also involved in major AI initiatives like Project Stargate and has been linked to potential acquisitions, including TikTok. His family's media ambitions extend further, as his son recently acquired Paramount, diversifying their substantial investments and influence.</p>

          <p>Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever and US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced a commitment to enhance cooperation in combating transnational drug smuggling, following a meeting at the Port of Antwerp. De Wever called for greater information-sharing between Europe and the United States, stressing that organized crime transcends national borders. Antwerp has been identified as a primary entry point for drugs into Europe, with a record 116 tons of cocaine seized in 2023, although seizures decreased in 2024 due to increased inspections. Both officials underscored the urgency of crushing the business model of drug cartels that pose a significant threat to their respective populations.</p>

Unlike competitors like Waymo and Tesla, Zoox's electric robotaxi is custom-built without a steering wheel or pedals, featuring a unique bidirectional design and face-to-face seating for four passengers. The company is offering free rides initially, with plans for broader expansion in Las Vegas, followed by San Francisco, Austin, and Miami. Despite a major head start by Waymo, Zoox aims to differentiate itself with a rider-centric vehicle design, although the industry faces significant safety and profitability challenges.</p>

          <p>Uber is expanding its ride-sharing services to include helicopter travel, partnering with electric air taxi maker Joby Aviation, in a move that will take its platform to the skies. This innovative initiative, following Joby's acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, will allow users to book flights directly through the Uber app in major global cities, potentially starting as early as next year. While specific routes and pricing are still pending, airport connections are a key focus, with current Blade services offering flights between Manhattan and New York airports for $195. This collaboration signifies a significant step towards integrating aerial ride-sharing into mainstream transportation, with future plans to transition to electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.</p>

          <p>Choi Mal-ja, a South Korean woman, has been acquitted by a court six decades after her conviction for causing grievous bodily harm in an act of self-defense against a sexual assault. In 1964, Choi, then 19, bit off part of her attacker's tongue to escape, leading to her conviction while her aggressor received a suspended sentence for lesser charges. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 79, successfully challenged the original ruling, with the Busan District Court deeming her actions "justifiable self-defense." This landmark decision overturns her 1965 conviction and offers hope for other victims, with plans to seek state compensation for the injustice suffered.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale costs, unexpectedly declined by 0.1% in August, marking the third deflationary reading this year. This tame inflation data, coupled with recent weak jobs figures, is intensifying market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut next week, with some even speculating about a half-point reduction. Despite President Trump's vocal criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, market reaction remained muted, as investors await the more closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The PPI report highlighted positive underlying inflation fundamentals, particularly in the services sector, suggesting a favorable backdrop for potential monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

Scientists reported finding organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide in clay-rich mudstones, compounds that are byproducts of microorganisms on Earth. While emphasizing that definitive conclusions require in-depth analysis of samples returned to Earth, researchers consider this the most promising candidate yet in the search for long-ago Martian life. The findings, published in Nature, represent a significant step in understanding the universe's potential for life, despite the challenges and costs associated with sample retrieval.</p>

This significant consolidation, welcomed by the Office for Students, aims to provide a stronger financial foundation for both institutions amidst growing economic challenges facing the higher education sector, where many English universities are in deficit. While the universities insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union anticipates job redundancies and criticizes the move as a crisis management tactic. The merger represents an innovative, albeit anxiety-inducing, approach to achieving stability and enhancing regional economic contributions, despite staff concerns about long-term prospects.</p>

Analysts were "blown away" by the results, calling them a "momentous confirmation" of Oracle's leadership in AI infrastructure.

Avelo, known for serving smaller cities and focusing on passenger experience, is betting on the E195-E2's two-by-two seating configuration and quieter cabins to appeal to customers. Despite the E2's advanced economics, it has been outsold by rivals, making this a crucial breakthrough for Embraer in the highly competitive U.S. market.</p>
