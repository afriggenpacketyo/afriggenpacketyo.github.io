          <p>The newly constructed IG Arena in Nagoya is preparing to host its inaugural event, the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, set to begin in July. An office has been established in Nagoya to organize the tournament, which will feature around 7,800 seats. The arena, capable of accommodating up to 17,000 spectators, is also slated to host the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final in December and various concerts. Former maegashira Oginohana, now Dewanoumi stablemaster, expressed anticipation for a successful preparation and a large turnout for the event, where Onosato will make his yokozuna debut. The event marks the first time since September 2021 that two yokozuna will simultaneously hold the top rank in sumo. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australia during May, with electric vehicle sales reaching their highest level in nearly a year. Vehicle sales jumped to 3,897, primarily driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which saw a 122.5% year-over-year increase. Despite this surge, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year. While this growth is encouraging for Tesla in Australia, analysts caution that it doesn't necessarily indicate a broader global recovery, as the company still faces headwinds in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city, involved closing off a significant portion of the city center, including the old town, several hotels, bridges, and the main railway station in Deutz. The bombs, two 200-pound and one 100-pound, were discovered in the Deutz district. Cologne was a major target during WWII, and bomb defusals are a relatively common occurrence in the city. </p>
