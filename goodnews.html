          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the U.S. will likely extend the upcoming deadline for its trade negotiations with China, currently set to expire on August 12. This would continue the suspension of heavy tariffs that both nations had imposed on each other's goods. Bessent expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, suggesting the talks in Stockholm could also address other key issues, including China's manufacturing surplus and its support for Russia. The discussions aim to build on recent progress that has de-escalated a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson is set to make his first appearance for the England Test cricket team in eight years, replacing the injured Shoaib Bashir for the fourth Test against India. Bashir, a young spinner who was a project pick for England, suffered a finger injury in the previous match, creating an unexpected opening for the veteran all-rounder. Dawson, whose consistent domestic performance has long been praised by fans, offers a different style of play and significantly strengthens England's batting lineup. His recall comes at a crucial moment in the tense series, with England leading 2-1 and looking to secure a victory at Old Trafford.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation and concerns about the stability of retirement funds, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity. This article advises homeowners to ask themselves four critical questions before proceeding. These include whether a reverse mortgage is the most intelligent way to borrow equity compared to alternatives like HELOCs, and if they can truly manage without it. Seniors are also urged to re-evaluate their financial goals for their beneficiaries and decide on the most suitable payment structure, ensuring the decision aligns with their long-term financial health and plans.

          <p>Mikko Huotari, the executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), has completed a visit to Beijing, marking a significant development since the think tank was sanctioned by China four years ago. Huotari was invited by a prominent Chinese think tank, suggesting a potential thaw in relations and an easing of travel restrictions. Merics, one of Europe's leading China-focused research institutions, has been unable to send researchers to the country since the sanctions were imposed. The visit is being welcomed as a positive step toward re-establishing engagement between European and Chinese researchers and policy experts.</p>

Another major concern is the ongoing impact of President Trump's global tariff policies and strained trade relations with China, which could affect everything from product sales to advertising revenue. The results will be critical in determining whether the recent rally in tech stocks, which has pushed the Nasdaq to record highs, can be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>DuPont received a significant boost after China's market regulator announced the suspension of its antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations. The probe, which began in April and was viewed as potential retaliation for U.S. tariffs, had created a major overhang on the company's stock. While the investigation concerned a relatively small portion of DuPont's business, it raised fears of broader implications for its electronics division and upcoming corporate breakup. The suspension of the probe removes a key uncertainty for investors ahead of the company's planned split in November, contributing to a rally in its shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of signing Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a deal valued at £63.5 million. While personal terms have been agreed upon for a five-year contract, negotiations between the clubs over the structure of add-on payments have slightly delayed the finalization. Gyokeres has been a top target for manager Mikel Arteta, who is eager to add an elite center-forward to his squad. The 27-year-old striker had an exceptional season in Portugal, scoring 54 goals in 52 games, and his signing would be a major boost to Arsenal's attacking options.</p>

          <p>While a Certificate of Deposit (CD) remains a reliable, fixed-rate savings option, the interest-earning potential has decreased over the past year. This article calculates the difference in earnings on a $20,000 deposit, showing that current rates, while still substantial, are lower than the highs of 2024. For example, a 3-year CD could have earned over $3,600 a year ago, compared to approximately $2,600 now. Despite the decline, today's rates are still significantly higher than they were a few years ago, making CDs an attractive option for savers seeking predictable returns before potential future rate cuts.

          <p>General Motors executives have declared the company the No. 2 electric vehicle manufacturer in the U.S., asserting it holds an "inherent advantage" over market leader Tesla. GM's CFO argued that while Tesla is dominant in a few narrow segments, its lack of diversity makes it vulnerable to volatile EV demand. In contrast, GM's ability to produce both gas and electric vehicles provides flexibility to meet customer needs as the market shifts, especially with the impending end of federal EV tax credits. While GM's EV sales doubled year-over-year, they still represent a small fraction of its total vehicle sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Set to be available by July 2026, the plan calculates monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum. It offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As the legislation also phases out several existing repayment plans, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers, who will have to choose between it and a standard 10-to-25-year fixed payment plan.
