          <p>Scientists have successfully helped Yosemite's native turtles recover by removing invasive bullfrogs from remote ponds. The American bullfrog, which preys on various species including turtle hatchlings, had decimated the Northwestern pond turtle population. By eradicating approximately 16,000 bullfrogs, researchers observed a resurgence in the turtle population, as well as other native species. This study highlights the potential for targeted invasive species removal to restore freshwater ecosystems, though it requires constant vigilance to prevent reinvasion.</p>

The revised policy will provide payments to pensioners with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less.</p>
