          <p>A vote on a major bill aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, despite Trump's and Speaker Johnson's calls for unity. Representatives Clyde, Brecheen, Smucker, Norman, and Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the savings would not take effect until after Trump leaves office. Norman expressed frustration with the lack of immediate changes to Medicaid work requirements, and the House Freedom Caucus indicated continued negotiations over the weekend. The White House urged Republicans to pass the bill, while Republicans acknowledged the challenges of navigating a diverse conference with a tight margin.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary on President Trump's birthday, June 14, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade will include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. Abrams tanks will also be featured, with metal plates laid down to protect the pavement, and White House officials said the cost will be shared by the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. While Trump claims the event is not tied to his birthday, some Democrats have criticized the cost as wasteful.</p>

Massey's father hopes the legislation will serve as a model for other states, and the bill now heads to Gov. Pritzker's desk after unanimous passage in the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first major foreign trip to the Middle East focused on securing deals and money for the U.S., while downplaying democracy and human rights concerns. The trip, marked by lavish displays of wealth and fealty, resulted in significant financial agreements and a controversial gift of a 747 from Qatar. Trump's approach signals a shift away from American moral leadership and towards prioritizing transactions over principles.</p>

          <p>The Army will place metal plates on Washington, D.C., streets to protect them during the upcoming parade featuring M1 Abrams tanks. The parade, honoring the Army's 250th birthday and coinciding with President Trump's birthday, will involve thousands of troops and vehicles. The metal plates are intended to prevent damage to the pavement from the tanks' heavy weight, a concern that previously prevented their use in a parade during Trump's first term.</p>
