          <p>China's retail sales experienced a significant surge in May, growing at the fastest pace since December 2023, largely driven by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the government's trade-in program for consumer goods. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates of 5%, while industrial output growth slowed slightly to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment also saw a slower expansion of 3.7%, and the urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, the lowest since November of the previous year. The rise in retail sales was a surprise, boosted by the consumer goods trade-in program, while falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge of over 15% following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, which includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and Carlyle Group, proposes a cash price of $5.76 per Santos share, a 27.73% premium over the previous closing price. Santos' board intends to recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, which would give the consortium control of Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in PNG LNG and Papua LNG. XRG's takeover bid comes as the investment firm has been on the hunt for deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has formally requested that eight countries and regions block access to licensed online casino websites targeting Japanese residents, as gambling with overseas-based betting sites is a crime in Japan.

This crackdown follows media reports of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with police estimating over 3 million people in Japan have gambled online.

          <p>Scientists in China have made significant progress in developing a new type of LED technology known as perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), which could revolutionize electronic devices. Researchers have found a way to extend the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years while maintaining comparable brightness to commercial displays. This breakthrough addresses a major obstacle in the commercial adoption of PeLEDs, which have previously suffered from instability and short lifespans. Durable and efficient PeLEDs could be used to create low-cost, ultra-bright lighting and high-end display screens.</p>

          <p>The final evacuation orders have been lifted in the Pacific Palisades nearly six months after a wildfire devastated the area. The remaining evacuation order was due to downed wires, potentially explosive lithium-ion batteries, and toxic wildfire debris. The Army Corps of Engineers cleared wreckage from over 3,200 properties, reducing the safety concerns. Although people are allowed to return, authorities urge caution and recommend wearing N-95 masks due to potential soil contamination.</p>
