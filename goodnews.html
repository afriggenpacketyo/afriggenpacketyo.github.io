          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, fueled by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has identified emerging markets as the next bull market, citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan also upgraded emerging market equities, noting thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen 8.55% year-to-date, contrasting with the S&P 500's 1% gain, indicating growing investor confidence in emerging economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are urging the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, for their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, accuses these airlines of misleading passengers and causing confusion with additional baggage charges. BEUC argues that these unfair practices breach EU consumer law, as passengers can pay up to ‚Ç¨280 extra for luggage. Consumer groups are seeking an investigation and sanctions, advocating for a standard luggage allowance to be included in ticket purchases.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues amid ongoing tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgment suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, emphasizing that tariffs are inappropriate for addressing trade imbalances. Both parties reaffirmed that exchange rates should be market-determined, avoiding discussions on desired foreign exchange levels.</p>

While the Trump administration has offered refugee status to Afrikaners claiming persecution, community members like cattle farmer Nick Serfontein say they feel safe and that racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate.
