          <p>The United States government has lifted its export restrictions on electronic design automation (EDA) software to China, as confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This move reverses a policy enacted in May that required U.S. companies to obtain licenses before exporting critical chip-design technology. The decision allows major players in the U.S.-dominated EDA market, including a subsidiary of Siemens, to restore access for their customers in China. This policy shift signals a potential de-escalation amid ongoing trade discussions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively working to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, as stated by its foreign minister during a visit to Beijing. This diplomatic effort is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign relations and reduce its historical dependence on Russia. The move comes after Armenia expressed frustration with Russia's failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and subsequently announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Both Armenia and China have indicated a mutual interest in officially upgrading their bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on congressional procedure, explaining what happens when a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives results in a tie. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or piece of legislation ends in a tie, the measure is considered lost and fails to pass. This rule becomes particularly relevant in times of a very narrow majority, where a few defections from the controlling party can easily lead to a legislative stalemate or defeat.</p>

Constructed from durable martensitic steel, the turbine is described as the "heart" of the new power unit.

The judge stayed the decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal. Civil rights groups praised the ruling as a critical affirmation of the right to seek asylum.</p>
