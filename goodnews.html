          <p>Puerto Rican music sensation Bad Bunny is leveraging his sold-out hometown residency and latest album, "DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS," to educate a global audience on the archipelago's rich and complex history. Collaborating with historian Jorell Meléndez-Badillo, the artist integrates historical narratives into his visualizers and live performances, covering topics from pre-Columbian eras to contemporary political movements and the influence of Afro-Caribbean rhythms. This initiative aims to democratize access to Puerto Rican culture and highlight the island's colonial reality, moving beyond the stereotypical "tropical paradise" image. Bad Bunny's work is empowering a "crisis generation" by amplifying conversations around colonialism, displacement, and the ongoing fiscal oversight board.</p>

          <p>Venice Beach recently hosted its vibrant "Legends Weekend," a significant event celebrating two decades of its distinctive basketball culture and community, honoring icons like Kobe Bryant and other street-ball legends. Nick Ansom, founder of Veniceball, orchestrated the festivities, which included various basketball activities such as youth and legends games, and a spectacular dunk contest featuring a leap over a limousine. The article emphasizes basketball's profound role as a universal language that transcends colors and borders, fostering deep camaraderie and a strong sense of family among players. This annual gathering showcases the enduring spirit and rich history of the iconic Venice courts, which Ansom proudly refers to as a "hoopers’ paradise."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a parent's strong argument for implementing phone bans in schools, citing their detrimental effects on student learning, increased social anxiety, and suppressed emotional and intellectual growth. The author, a former teacher, shares personal anecdotes about her daughter's constant phone use during school and references academic literature and international examples, such as Australia's successful country-wide ban. Such bans have reportedly led to reduced distractions, improved learning, and increased socializing. While acknowledging some practical uses for smartphones in education, the article emphasizes the difficulty for adolescents to resist digital impulses and the importance of fostering in-person interactions and independent problem-solving skills without digital escape hatches.</p>

          <p>Groundbreaking clinical trial in South Africa has delivered promising news in the quest for an HIV cure, with one young woman, Anele, remaining HIV-free more than two years after discontinuing treatment. Conducted as part of the FRESH program in Umlazi, the trial employed a "kick and kill" strategy using vesatolimod and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) specifically tailored for clade C, the predominant HIV strain in sub-Saharan Africa. The article underscores the critical importance of conducting such trials in Africa, where the majority of people living with HIV reside, and highlights the historical underrepresentation of women in cure research. While not a complete success, the achievement of long-term viral control in 20% of participants offers significant hope and is inspiring further research across the region.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper is set to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion deal, a strategic move aimed at revitalizing its struggling U.S. coffee business and generating $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies, effectively undoing its 2018 merger. This restructuring is designed to enhance its appeal to at-home coffee consumers and expand into the cold coffee market. The article notes that the coffee company will be led by current CFO Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, while the beverage firm will be helmed by CEO Tim Cofer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dietitian Dr. Jessica Knurick has emerged as a leading voice against the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., by creating viral content on Instagram and TikTok. Knurick effectively debunks MAHA's anti-science narratives and conspiratorial health claims, acknowledging that while their concerns about chronic diseases are genuine, their explanations for the crisis are often misleading. Her project aims to reach audiences open to evidence-based perspectives by adopting MAHA's communication tools, focusing on media literacy, and exposing financial conflicts of interest within the less-regulated wellness industry. Her growing follower count suggests she is making inroads in countering misinformation.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Questions Why Boys Still Play Tackle Football If It's Deemed Unsafe for Girls</h2>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the double standard in high school sports, where flag football is rapidly gaining popularity for girls due to safety concerns, while boys continue to play tackle football despite known risks like CTE and Parkinson's disease. The author argues that this disparity reflects a societal failure to address the dangers of a narrow definition of masculinity, which often encourages boys to ignore injuries. Tracing the historical and financial investment in boys' tackle football, the article suggests it is time to reevaluate the game for all genders. It advocates for a shift towards flag football for boys as well, given increasing public awareness of its long-term health costs.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the burgeoning use of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, exploring their potential beyond weight loss and diabetes to treat conditions such as dementia, addiction, and other compulsive behaviors. While acknowledging their remarkable efficacy and upcoming accessibility, the article raises a critical unanswered question: the long-term psychological effects of modulating human desire. It discusses how these drugs influence brain pathways related to "wanting" versus "liking," and whether suppressing harmful compulsions might inadvertently compromise other productive desires or emotional experiences. Experts urge more research into these complex impacts, balancing the "genuine promise" of these medications with the potential for unforeseen consequences on the human experience.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping extended independence day greetings to Ukraine, a message that President Zelensky subsequently shared on social media. Xi expressed his readiness to collaborate with Zelensky to guide bilateral relations towards "steady and long-term development," aiming to benefit the peoples of both countries. This diplomatic gesture comes despite China's deepening ties with Russia since the invasion, with Beijing consistently maintaining a neutral stance on the conflict. Zelensky appreciated the congratulations, affirming a mutual interest in fostering long-term dialogue based on mutual respect, and working towards peace, stability, and prosperity.

          <h2>New Research Suggests Fish May Experience Pleasure and Actively Seek It Out</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common perceptions, new scientific research indicates that fish may possess the capacity to experience pleasure and actively pursue it. A study involving bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish revealed that butterflyfish showed a preference for areas where they had previously received "cleanings" from wrasse, even when parasite-free. Experiments using opioid mimics and blockers further suggested that an opioid system mediates this pleasurable sensation, while a distinct dopamine system drives the "wanting" behavior. This groundbreaking research challenges conventional views of fish as simple-minded creatures, advocating for a reevaluation of their treatment in aquariums and aquaculture, and highlighting the ancient evolutionary roots of positive emotional states.</p>
