          <p>President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, marking his first military commencement address since his return to office. The speech comes amid the Trump administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Recent changes include disbanding several student clubs focused on race and gender and removing books related to diversity from academy libraries, actions criticized by some as hindering education and debate.

The review will set government budgets until 2029, influencing the political landscape for years to come.
