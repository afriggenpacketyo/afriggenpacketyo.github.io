          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has explicitly targeted what it calls "disorderly low-price competition" as a problem requiring government regulation. The term was used at a high-level economic meeting to describe the intense price wars affecting numerous Chinese industries. This direct language marks a shift from the more ambiguous term "involutionary competition" previously used by officials. Beijing views curbing these price wars as essential for fostering innovation, improving product quality, and ensuring the healthy development of its economy by phasing out outdated production capacity.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to end the program for Haitians in September, but the judge found that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The ruling provides temporary relief for migrants who rely on the status for legal residency and work permits, citing the ongoing instability and violence in Haiti. The White House has announced it will appeal the decision.</p>
