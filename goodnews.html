          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 11:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's twelfth album, "The Life of a Showgirl," is being interpreted as a definitive statement on her long-held professional ambition. The article suggests that after years of balancing a relatable persona with an intense drive for success, Swift is now openly acknowledging her satisfaction with achieving fame. The album's title track, in particular, concludes with the sentiment that despite the pains of celebrity, she "wouldn't have it any other way." This shift is seen as a significant evolution in her public image, moving away from feigned surprise and towards an unapologetic embrace of her powerful position in the music industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has reinstated Dwayne Dixon, a teaching associate professor who was placed on administrative leave over concerns about his support for political violence. The university conducted a "thorough threat assessment" following reports of his ties to Redneck Revolt, a far-left gun group, and his past advocacy for armed action against white supremacists. Officials concluded that Dixon does not pose a threat to the campus community and has not violated university policy. The initial decision to place him on leave had sparked protests from both supporters and critics on campus.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the Singapore Grand Prix, outpacing his teammate and championship rival Lando Norris. The session was challenging for Norris, who finished fifth and described it as a "bad day" after struggling with the car's feel. His practice was further complicated by a pit-lane collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, which damaged the McLaren's front wing. The session was also interrupted by two red flags caused by separate crashes involving Mercedes' George Russell and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, disrupting teams' race simulation runs.</p>

          <p>Aston Martin's CEO, Andy Cowell, has stated that former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner appears to be actively seeking a new position within Formula 1. Speaking at the Singapore Grand Prix, Cowell mentioned that Horner has been "ringing up pretty much every team owner" to explore opportunities. Despite speculation linking Horner to Aston Martin, Cowell confirmed that he checked with team owner Lawrence Stroll and there are no plans for Horner to join the team in either an operational or investment capacity. This indicates Horner is keen on a swift return to the sport following his departure from Red Bull.</p>

          <p>OnePay, the fintech company majority-owned by retail giant Walmart, is planning to add cryptocurrency trading and custody services to its mobile banking application later this year. According to sources, the platform will initially offer access to bitcoin and ether through a partnership with the crypto infrastructure startup Zerohash. This move signals OnePay's ambition to become a comprehensive financial "super app" by integrating digital assets into its existing suite of services, which includes banking, credit, and buy now, pay later loans.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 10:31:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Florian Wirtz's initial performances at Liverpool suggests his underwhelming start is not due to a lack of quality but rather the new tactical role he is being asked to play. The £116m signing has yet to record a goal or assist, but the article argues he is being deployed deeper to help with build-up play, a responsibility that reduces his time near the opposition's goal. Furthermore, the increased intensity and reduced space in the Premier League, combined with manager Arne Slot's demanding pressing system, may be contributing to physical fatigue. The analysis concludes that Wirtz's effectiveness will likely improve as he adapts and the team refines its tactical balance.</p>

          <p>The Church of England has named the Reverend Sarah Mullally as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury, making her the first woman to hold the institution's highest office. Mullally, a former chief nursing officer for England, will become the spiritual leader for over 85 million Anglicans worldwide. Her appointment comes as the church navigates a period of controversy following the resignation of her predecessor over the handling of a sexual assault scandal. In her new role, Mullally will be formally installed in January and will lead an institution founded centuries ago under King Henry VIII.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the newly-elected leader of the UK's Green Party, has called for a tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to fund a significant expansion of public services. In his address at the party conference, Polanski argued that this revenue could pay for universal free childcare, improved special needs education, and rural bus routes, thereby ending what he called "rip-off Britain." He also strongly defended the rights of migrants and refugees and criticized the Labour Party for, in his view, adopting the rhetoric of the right-wing Reform UK party on immigration. Polanski aims to position the Greens as a distinctly left-wing alternative to Labour.</p>

          <p>Seven people from Kenya have won a landmark legal case in a London Family Court, successfully proving they were fathered by British men stationed at an army base in their country. The case utilized commercially available DNA databases to identify the fathers, six of whom had served at the British Army Training Unit in Kenya (Batuk). This is the first time paternity has been established in this manner in a UK court. The ruling is a significant victory for the claimants, who have faced social stigma, and it opens a path for them to apply for British citizenship.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the artificial intelligence sector is currently in an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide enormous benefits to society. Speaking at an event in Italy, he compared the situation to past bubbles where investor excitement leads to both good and bad ideas getting funded, with stock prices often disconnected from business fundamentals. However, Bezos argued that such industrial bubbles can be positive, as they accelerate innovation. He believes that once the dust settles, society will be left with transformative inventions, much like what occurred after the biotech bubble of the 1990s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Thomas Tuchel, has chosen not to include Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham in his latest squad, despite the player's desire to be selected. The decision is seen as a statement that no player, regardless of their status, is guaranteed a spot and that selections will be based on performance and fitness. Bellingham has only started one game for his club since returning from shoulder surgery. Tuchel emphasized the need to build a team that is not solely reliant on one player, especially with the World Cup approaching, and to reward the players who performed exceptionally well in the recent 5-0 victory over Serbia.</p>
