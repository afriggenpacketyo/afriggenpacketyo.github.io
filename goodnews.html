        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to China marked a significant display of solidarity between the two communist nations, highlighted by privileged treatment from Beijing. Analysts noted that during the high-stakes summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping's government strategically avoided mentioning the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." This calculated move, combined with pledges of economic support, is seen as reinforcing Pyongyang's alignment with Beijing and Moscow. The visit ultimately boosts Kim's leverage in regional politics by showcasing China's full-throated endorsement on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has taken an approximately 10% ownership stake in the semiconductor company Intel, making it the firm's largest single shareholder. This unusual move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing capabilities amid escalating technological competition with China and geopolitical risks surrounding Taiwan, a key hub for chip production. The investment, which converts previous grants under the CHIPS Act into equity, aims to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains for strategically important microchips.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article suggests that for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to realize its full potential, its declarations of political intent must be supported by a robust multilateral economic framework. The author draws a parallel to the Bretton Woods agreement, arguing that a similar institutional structure for monetary and trade policy is needed for the bloc, which includes China, Russia, and India. Without such foundational agreements, the implementation of cooperative pledges remains a significant challenge, risking further fragmentation of the global order.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, making him second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. The event has reignited national debate over the country's male-only succession law, as the 19-year-old prince is one of only two male heirs younger than the current emperor in the aging Imperial Family. This scarcity of male successors highlights broader demographic challenges in Japan and puts pressure on conservatives to consider alternatives, including allowing female members to ascend the throne.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is shadowed by political controversy, as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has criticized the movement's legacy, echoing the Nazi party's historical denunciation of its work as "degenerate art." The director of the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation acknowledged the pressure but noted that the attacks have also generated significant public support for the celebrated institution.</p>

          <h2>Personal Essay Explores Finding a Sense of Home and Community Through Buffalo Bills Fandom</h2>

          <p>This article is a personal reflection on how becoming a fan of the Buffalo Bills football team created a profound sense of belonging and community. The author connects the team's underdog spirit and resilience to the identity of the city of Buffalo itself, which is often depicted as hard on its luck but is undergoing a quiet revival. The essay argues that sports allegiance is not just about geography or family tradition but can be a gift that provides a powerful feeling of home, even for someone who previously had no interest in sports.</p>

          <p>The board of directors at Tesla has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package is contingent on him achieving a series of extremely ambitious targets over the next decade, including growing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. This move, which requires shareholder approval, is designed to incentivize Musk to remain at the company and focus his efforts on transforming Tesla into a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics.

          <p>The Scottish men's national football team earned a valuable point in a draw against Denmark in Copenhagen, marking a strong start to their World Cup qualification campaign. The performance was praised for its work rate and grit, putting early pressure on Denmark, one of the group's main rivals. This result is particularly significant as it breaks a historical pattern of Scotland starting qualification campaigns poorly. The team's determined effort against a higher-ranked opponent has provided a sense of hope for their chances of reaching a World Cup for the first time since 1998.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at the 30th anniversary of one of football's most audacious moments: Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita's "scorpion kick" save at Wembley Stadium. The unconventional move, performed during a 1995 friendly match against England, cemented his legacy as a flamboyant and unpredictable player. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the modern 'sweeper-keeper' role, famous for taking risks far outside his penalty area. The piece reflects on his unique career, which also included scoring 43 goals and a controversial off-field life.</p>

This ruling provides a crucial, albeit potentially temporary, reprieve for hundreds of thousands who were facing the loss of their legal right to live and work in the United States.</p>

These companies are offering multimillion-dollar compensation packages to attract and retain the top researchers and engineers needed to build and train advanced AI models. This high-stakes hiring spree is driven by the massive capital investment required for AI development, where a $10 million salary for a key engineer is considered a relatively small part of a billion-dollar project, creating challenges for smaller startups.</p>
