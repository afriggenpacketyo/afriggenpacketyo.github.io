          <h2>Tariffs Have Yet to Significantly Increase Inflation Due to Hoarding and Lag Time</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation readings, as recent data on consumer and producer prices remain stable. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff implementation and the time it takes for tariffs to affect the real economy. Additionally, companies face limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. While the May data shows a limited impact, experts anticipate that the effects of tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months, so it is important to monitor economic trends to observe the full effects of these trade policies.

          <p>A new study by LendingTree analyzes tipping rates across the United States, finding that New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of spending on food away from home, while Utah residents tip the least, at 4.09%. Tipping rates correlate with how often people dine out in each state, with East Coast states generally tipping more than those in the South and West. Americans spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars, and other eateries in 2023, with spending on dining out representing approximately 56% of Americans' food budgets, marking a 13% increase from 2000.
