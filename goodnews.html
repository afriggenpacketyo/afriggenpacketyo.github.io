          <p>Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retired due to a thigh injury during their semi-final match. Alcaraz was leading 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0, 2-0 when Musetti, who had been seeking his first major final appearance, was forced to concede. Alcaraz expressed sympathy for Musetti's situation, emphasizing that he prefers to win under fair circumstances. The defending champion is set to compete against either Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner in the final on Sunday after demonstrating his attacking prowess following a leveled first set. The match showcased high-quality clay-court tennis before the unfortunate injury. The 22-year-old Alcaraz is seeking his second successive French Open title. The final score will determine who will be the victor of this year's French Open, one of the most prestigious events in tennis. </p>

Russell emphasized his commitment to conveying the message of the people at Holyrood, highlighting the need for politicians to deliver on their promises. The Reform UK party finished third, while the Conservatives came in fourth, underscoring a shift in the Scottish political landscape.

          <p>The stock market rebounded on Friday, spurred by a favorable update on nonfarm payrolls, which indicated the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%. The report also showed hourly wages increased by 3.9% compared to the previous year, exceeding expectations. This positive data alleviated concerns stemming from recent suboptimal labor market reports. The market's positive reaction underscores the U.S. economy's reliance on private consumption, which constitutes approximately two-thirds of its gross domestic product. The jobs data eased fears of an imminent recession, while also suggesting that Federal Reserve rate cuts remain a possibility in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed stringent new capital regulations that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. The measures also entail UBS fully capitalizing its foreign units and potentially reducing share buybacks. These changes aim to stabilize UBS and enhance its attractiveness in areas such as asset management. While UBS supports most of the regulatory proposals, it disagrees with the substantial increase in capital requirements. UBS shares experienced a jump of 6% following the announcement and ended the trading session 3.8% higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices experienced a slight decrease in May, easing from the recent high seen in April, as consumers who feared tariff-related price increases rushed to purchase cars and trucks. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, which tracks wholesale used vehicle prices, fell by 1.5% from April to May, but remained 4% higher than the previous year. Retail prices traditionally follow wholesale prices, but the decline has been slower in recent years. While tariffs on new imported vehicles don't directly affect used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand influence the used car market. Demand remains relatively strong, while used vehicle inventory levels remain low compared to historical levels. </p>

          <p>Coco Gauff is set to contest her second French Open final, bringing a sunny outlook and experience gained from her previous run in 2022. Gauff emphasized the importance of not fearing failure. She will face Aryna Sabalenka, in a battle between defense and attack. Their head-to-head record is tied at 5-5, with many of their matches being close contests. A win for Gauff would represent a significant achievement in her career. </p>

          <p>Tesla stock climbed about 5% as it attempted to recover from the impact of the public argument between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts cited reports of a potential truce between the two. However, a White House official indicated that Trump is "not interested" in a call with Musk. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggested that the feud had caused Tesla shares to be oversold. The situation follows several days of Musk criticizing Trump's tax and spending bill.
