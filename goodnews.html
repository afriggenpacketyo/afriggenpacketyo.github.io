          <p>Chicago Sky All-Star Angel Reese has spoken out about the intense cyberbullying she has faced since winning the 2023 national championship with LSU, which included threats and the exposure of her personal information. In response, she has launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issue, noting that not everyone has the thick skin she has developed. Reese explained that the experience initially made her withdrawn but she is now opening up more, emphasizing the importance of community and giving back by turning a negative situation into a positive one.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the United Kingdom over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday, potentially redistributing the time off throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help prevent learning loss, alleviate childcare pressures for working parents, and address "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, believe the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and there are concerns that a shorter summer could concentrate holiday demand, potentially driving up travel prices even further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is exploring ways to shift public savings from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments to boost the economy. Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested that savers could be sent details of investment opportunities and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the move. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and warn that a poorly executed push could backfire, especially in volatile markets. The debate highlights the tension between the safety of cash savings and the potential long-term rewards and economic benefits of investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran guard and former Defensive Player of the Year, Marcus Smart, is set to join the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. Smart plans to sign a two-year, $11 million deal with the Lakers, which includes a player option for the second year. The move addresses the Lakers' need for a strong perimeter defender, a role they sought to fill after a key free agent signed elsewhere. Smart, known for his defensive tenacity and versatility, is expected to significantly bolster the team's defensive capabilities in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers for six seasons and led the "Lob City" era, would bring extensive experience and playmaking ability to the roster. The potential signing is part of the team's strategy to add depth and ball-handling skills to compete in the Western Conference. If signed, Paul would join a veteran guard lineup and would be expected to accept a reserve role on the team.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national football team has reached the semifinals of Euro 2025 after a dramatic 6-5 victory on penalties against France.

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by the year 2030, marking the first time a specific reduction target has been set. This commitment follows public outrage over waterway pollution and new data showing serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The plan also aims to significantly reduce phosphorus pollution from treated wastewater to combat harmful algae blooms. The announcement comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, which faces scrutiny for its environmental performance amid rising consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the UK are strengthening their security and defense cooperation, forming a trilateral group known as the "E3" in a significant pivot in European foreign policy. This alliance, solidified by a new German-UK treaty and joint diplomatic efforts, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled that Europe must become more independent in its defense, suggesting the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK could supplement U.S. protection.

For Barcelona, the move addresses their need to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, the Spanish champions are reportedly willing to take a calculated risk on the 27-year-old England international, seeing his potential as a major asset.</p>

However, as replacements were introduced, their momentum faded, allowing an undercooked Australian side to score two late tries and make the final scoreline more respectable.

          <p>A report from Bank of America analysts posits that quantum computing could represent the most significant technological revolution for humanity since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to perform incredibly complex calculations almost instantly, which could "warp-speed" human development. Potential applications include creating new drugs and materials, enhancing AI, and revolutionizing logistics. While major milestones have been achieved, analysts note the technology has yet to solve a practical real-world problem faster than a classical computer due to instability issues.

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as "Operation Valkyrie," is being commemorated.

In the aftermath, Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators were executed. While the plotters were initially viewed as traitors, they are now honored as heroes in modern Germany, though historians debate their democratic ideals and motivations, noting the attempt came late in the war.</p>
