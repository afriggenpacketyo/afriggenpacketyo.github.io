          <p>In the wake of recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, financial experts are advising savers on what constitutes a good interest rate for high-yield savings accounts. Currently, rates in the 4.20% to 4.30% range are considered competitive, offering a significantly better return than traditional savings accounts, which average just 0.40%. Unlike CDs, these accounts provide liquidity without withdrawal penalties, making them an attractive option for earning interest while maintaining access to funds in a changing economic climate.

          <p>A new biography of the late author Peter Matthiessen, titled "True Nature," portrays his life of travel, writing, and Zen Buddhism as a single, relentless spiritual quest to escape his privileged upbringing and find an authentic self. The article reviews the book, positioning Matthiessen as a powerful archetype for today's dissatisfied strivers, from tech billionaires to wellness seekers, who use their resources to search for meaning elsewhere. Ultimately, his story serves as a warning that a genuine spiritual journey is difficult, private, and offers no shortcuts to enlightenment.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank is approaching the end of its program to reduce its massive bond holdings, a process known as quantitative tightening. In a speech, Powell noted that the Fed's goal is to maintain "ample" reserves for banks and that it may reach that point in the coming months. However, he offered no clear guidance on the future direction of interest rates, stating that policymakers are still navigating the tension between their employment and inflation goals amid uncertainty caused by the government shutdown's impact on economic data.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving intact a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The decision finalizes the record-breaking sum he was ordered to pay to the families of the victims, who testified that they were harassed and threatened for years by his followers. Jones had argued the Connecticut trial violated his free speech rights, but the court's refusal to hear the case marks a definitive end to his legal challenges.</p>
