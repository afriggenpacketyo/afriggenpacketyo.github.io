          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, confirming he will be reincarnated and have a successor. This declaration ends years of speculation that he might be the final person to hold the title. In his statement, the 90-year-old spiritual leader emphasized that the process of identifying his reincarnation must follow traditional Buddhist practices and be handled exclusively by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. This move is seen as a direct challenge to Beijing, which has repeatedly asserted its authority to approve the next Dalai Lama.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced a government initiative to regulate "disorderly low-price competition" across various industries, a phenomenon that has been fueling intense price wars. The move aims to steer companies away from suppressing prices to gain market share and instead focus on improving product quality and innovation. This policy is seen as crucial for China's long-term economic health, as the current "involutionary competition" is believed to hinder industrial upgrading and efficiency. The directive signals a more direct government intervention to manage market behavior and promote the exit of outdated production capacity from the economy.</p>

          <p>The first day of NBA free agency saw surprising and significant player movements, headlined by Myles Turner leaving the Indiana Pacers to sign a four-year, $107 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from an Achilles tendon injury and will now be a free agent. In other major news, Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander agreed to a record-setting four-year, $285 million extension.

          <p>A new version of President Trump's major domestic policy package, which recently passed the Senate, includes a significant boost for the semiconductor industry. The bill proposes raising tax credits for chipmakers building manufacturing plants in the United States from 25% to 35%. This measure is an expansion of the 2022 CHIPS Act and is designed to accelerate the onshoring of the advanced semiconductor supply chain from Asia. Companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron stand to benefit, which could further incentivize their investments in U.S.-based production facilities amid ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions.

          <p>China is strategically increasing its investments in Africa's copper sector to secure essential supplies for its green energy transition, as Western nations impose restrictions on mineral access. Chinese companies are heavily investing in mining and processing facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, and are now expanding their focus to Botswana. This move is critical as copper is a vital component for technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels.

The judge stated that the administration does not have the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation and that migrants have built lives in reliance on the existing deadline. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, which advocates have praised for protecting a vulnerable population.</p>
