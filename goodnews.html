          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. The two main candidates are Lee Jae-myung from the liberal Democratic Party, who leads in the polls despite facing ongoing corruption investigations, and Kim Moon-soo from the conservative People Power Party, who is trailing behind. Lee Jae-myung is a former mayor, governor, and lawmaker, while Kim Moon-soo previously served as a governor and a member of the National Assembly, attempting to distance himself from the ousted president Yoon. The Democratic Party already holds a parliamentary majority, adding significance to this election amid political turmoil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offices in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. These lawmakers argued that the closures would negatively impact farmers who rely on these offices for essential services like loans, grants, and technical assistance. The initial plan to close the offices was part of a broader effort to cut costs across government agencies, but the reversal reflects the importance of these services to California's large agricultural sector. The USDA will continue discussions regarding the Mt. Shasta office, the only one not being reopened, to determine if its services can be provided elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing renovations, which had contributed to recent flight delays and cancellations. The resumption of regular runway operations is expected to alleviate congestion at the airport, which has faced staffing shortages and technical issues. The Port Authority accelerated the construction schedule by hiring additional crews and coordinating with contractors, allowing for around-the-clock work. While the runway is open for use, some weeknight and weekend closures are still planned to fully complete the project by the end of the year.</p>

It also brings an established institutional client base, which Robinhood has lacked, allowing it to tap into institutional crypto flows and offer services like lending and staking infrastructure. The acquisition is part of Robinhood's effort to rebrand itself as a serious player in the regulated and institutional digital asset finance space.</p>
