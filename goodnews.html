          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is facing economic uncertainty due to decreased consumer sentiment and changing eating habits. The family-run business, which has been serving the community for 50 years, has noticed a decrease in foot traffic and an increase in customers sharing meals and taking leftovers home. The owner has paused expansion plans and is struggling to retain staff, as many workers are leaving the restaurant industry for the flexibility of the gig economy. Despite these challenges, the diner remains a vital community gathering place.</p>

The PAP has governed the wealthy city-state since before its independence in 1965, and the strong showing in this election strengthens Wong's position as he navigates Singapore through economic uncertainty and rising living costs.</p>
