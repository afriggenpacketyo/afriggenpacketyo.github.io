The firm announced a $250 million private placement to fund this strategy, signaling a strong belief in the token's future for digital authentication in an AI-driven world. This move mirrors a growing trend where public companies accumulate crypto assets beyond Bitcoin to enhance shareholder value. Ives' involvement highlights increasing institutional interest in specialized digital assets tied to emerging technologies like biometric identity verification. (not investment advice)</p>

James reflected on reuniting with a former Chinese college player he met over a decade ago and expressed his hope to contribute to the development of basketball in the country.

          <p>Major U.S. corporations like Coca-Cola and McDonald's are launching marketing campaigns in Germany that emphasize their products are "Made in Germany," a strategy to counter declining American favorability. As consumer sentiment shifts, these brands are highlighting their use of local supply chains and their deep-rooted presence in German society to distance themselves from U.S. politics. This trend is not limited to Germany, as other companies like Tesla and Heinz face similar challenges in international markets. The campaigns reflect a broader effort by American firms to tailor their brand image to local audiences in a complex geopolitical climate.</p>

          <p>A new study from Northwestern Medicine has discovered the presence of Human Pegivirus (HPgV) in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, but not in a control group without the condition. This finding challenges the long-held belief that HPgV is a harmless virus that does not infect the brain. Researchers found the virus in half of the Parkinson's brains they examined and noted that its presence was associated with more advanced brain changes related to the disease. The discovery suggests a potential environmental factor that may interact with genetic predispositions to influence the development of Parkinson's, opening new avenues for research.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private equity firms are aggressively recruiting talent, particularly for fundraising and investor relations roles, as securing capital becomes increasingly challenging. After a slowdown in dealmaking due to rising interest rates, firms are now investing heavily in distribution teams to attract funds from limited partners. This hiring spree has sparked a talent war with investment banks, with firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan implementing new rules to prevent their analysts from being poached. The competition is global, with firms expanding their presence in Asia, Europe, and North America to position themselves for an anticipated rebound in deal activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese lawmakers are reviewing the first draft of significant amendments to the country's Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, aiming to modernize the 18-year-old legislation. The proposed changes are intended to create a more effective market-exit mechanism for struggling businesses amid China's economic slowdown and structural transition. Experts believe the revisions are crucial for allowing unprofitable "zombie enterprises" to exit the market in an orderly fashion, which would help clear economic bottlenecks and better protect stakeholders' rights. The update is seen as a foundational step in adapting the legal framework to the needs of the current economic environment.</p>

          <p>A legislative movement is growing across the United States to address menopause as a public policy priority, with a new California bill, AB 432, at the forefront. The bill aims to improve affordability and quality of care by requiring health insurance to cover menopause treatments and incentivizing specialized medical training for clinicians. Advocates, including actor Halle Berry, are urging Governor Gavin Newsom to sign the legislation, positioning California to become a national leader on the issue. The movement frames accessible menopause care not just as a health issue, but as a crucial component of supporting women's well-being and participation in the economy and society.</p>

          <p>As climate change expands their habitats, a guide has been released to help identify the seven most dangerous mosquito species in the United States known for transmitting diseases. These key vectors, belonging to the Culex, Anopheles, and Aedes genera, are responsible for spreading illnesses such as West Nile virus, malaria, and dengue. The article provides details on their appearance and behavior, noting that only females bite. Understanding which mosquitoes are present can help public health officials and individuals take targeted protective measures as warming temperatures and changing rainfall patterns increase the risk of vector-borne disease outbreaks across the country.</p>

          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has announced that the Premier League club is not for sale, confirming it has "unequivocally rejected" two preliminary expressions of interest. The statement came after the recent departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential takeover. The club's majority owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, affirmed it has no intention of selling its stake. One of the approaches came from PCP International Finance, which has since confirmed it will not make an offer, effectively preventing another bid for six months under UK takeover rules.</p>
