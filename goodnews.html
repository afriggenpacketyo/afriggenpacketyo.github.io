          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings forecasts for its recent quarter, driven by strong customer response to sales events and innovation in computing and gaming, including the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. Despite this modest recovery, the retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing "uncertainty of potential tariff impacts" on consumers and its business. CEO Corie Barry noted a potential slowdown in the third quarter as shoppers await holiday deals, impacting big-ticket purchases. The company is strategically expanding its third-party marketplace and in-store experiences to stimulate growth amidst challenging economic factors and declining annual sales.

          <p>NBC is strategically scheduling "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" to air after four "Sunday Night Football" games this fall, including two high-profile Kansas City Chiefs matchups. This initiative aims to leverage the NFL's massive viewership, particularly with the added pop culture draw of Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift, to revitalize Fallon's ratings. The move underscores the challenges facing late-night television, with declining viewership and revenue leading to the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." NBC is committed to its late-night programs, viewing them as valuable ecosystems for promoting NBCUniversal content and generating revenue beyond traditional ratings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an upwardly revised annual pace of 3.3% in the second quarter, surpassing initial estimates and rebounding from a 0.5% contraction in Q1 2025. This stronger performance was driven by increased business investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property, as well as robust consumer spending. The first-quarter decline was largely attributed to a surge in imports, a trend that reversed in Q2, significantly contributing to the growth. However, experts note that the overall strength for the first half of the year averages only 1.4%, with underlying private-sector demand remaining weak apart from an ongoing surge in AI-related investments.

          <p>England Women's Rugby captain Zoe Aldcroft has been ruled out of the remainder of the World Cup pool stage due to a knee injury sustained during the opening match against the United States. This marks her first absence from the squad since being appointed captain in January. Former captain Marlie Packer will take over as skipper, leading a significantly rotated team with 13 changes for the upcoming game against Samoa. Despite Aldcroft's injury and the wholesale changes, the Red Roses, who are on a 28-game winning streak after thrashing the US 69-7, are in a strong position to qualify for the knockout stages, utilizing strategic player rotation for squad game time.</p>

          <p>Global popstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce have announced their engagement, featuring a prominent old mine brilliant cut diamond ring designed by Kindred Lubeck. Experts estimate the ring, potentially upwards of 10 carats, could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, ranging from $250,000 to $500,000. While the ring is expected to influence jewelry trends, replicating its exact style may be challenging due to the rarity and cost of true old mine diamonds, particularly at larger carat weights. Couples inspired by Swift's ring can explore more accessible options, such as less expensive gemstones, other elongated diamond shapes like cushions or emeralds, or delve into the vintage jewelry market to find similar aesthetics within their budget.</p>

          <p>Armagh musician Marty Rafferty has successfully broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing for over 24 hours straight. Despite suffering a broken thumb and experiencing a fading voice, Rafferty began his marathon session at midday on Wednesday and surpassed the record just after noon on Thursday, though he concluded early due to his injuries. He used this impressive and persistent feat to raise money for a local Christmas toy appeal, showcasing his dedication and community spirit. The "buskathon" at Armagh's Market Street bandstand required strict adherence to rules, including not repeating songs within four hours and a 30-second break between each track.</p>

          <p>New York City is undertaking its decennial Trees Count, a comprehensive census to map and assess the health of its park trees, building on previous efforts that cataloged street trees. Volunteers are meticulously identifying species, measuring trunk circumferences, and grading tree health from "poor" to "excellent," demonstrating a strong community engagement. This initiative, which complements Lidar technology used for street trees, aims to inform urban planning, increase the city's canopy cover to 30% by 2035, and mitigate disproportionate "heat burdens" in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. The census also tracks the city's success in expanding tree diversity, now logging 541 species, which enhances the urban forest's resilience against various disturbances.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban offers five essential financial tips designed to help retirees avoid financial disaster, emphasizing surprisingly simple yet effective strategies. His advice includes rigorously living below one's means, avoiding credit card debt by consistently paying off balances each month, and establishing a strong emergency fund of at least six months' income before considering investments. Cuban also recommends channeling savings into low-cost mutual funds, specifically S&P 500 index funds, for reliable long-term growth. Furthermore, he encourages retirees to adopt an active and curious mindset, suggesting that continuous engagement, potentially through a side hustle, can both stretch savings and provide greater security in retirement.

          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration should extend its successes in the war on drugs by prioritizing diplomatic cooperation with Mexico over unilateral military force against drug cartels. Despite initial tensions, Presidents Trump and Sheinbaum have resumed collaboration on extraditions, border deployments, and military training, which are seen as less diplomatically costly. The article argues that unilateral military action risks undermining the bilateral relationship for little strategic gain, as historical supply-side interventions have been largely ineffective, particularly against synthetic drugs like fentanyl. Instead, it advocates for focusing on demand-side solutions and harm reduction efforts, noting encouraging declines in U.S. overdose deaths and successful state-level programs as a more promising path forward.</p>

Private firms are vital to China's economy, contributing over half of the nation's total tax revenue, 60% of its gross domestic product, and 80% of urban jobs. The survey underscores the sector's resilience and expanding global market presence, supported by a more favorable policy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jay Roach's "The Roses," a remake of the 1989 film, is a seductive attempt to revitalize the adult R-rated comedy genre, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as the hilariously battling divorcees, Theo and Ivy Rose. Written by Tony McNamara, the film unleashes brutal humor and sharp dialogue as the couple fights over their California dream mansion, reflecting on their complex, love-hate relationship. Unlike the original, which faced criticism for unlikable characters, this version delves deeper into the nuances of their dissolution, making them more relatable despite their escalating antics. The movie is lauded for its strong performances, particularly Cumberbatch's rare comedic opportunity, and its insightful portrayal of modern relationship pressures.</p>
