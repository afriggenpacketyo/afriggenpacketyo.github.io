        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink believes that the company's acquisition of Preqin, a provider of alternative asset data, could be its most significant deal of 2024, despite being the smallest at $3.2 billion. Preqin's data is being integrated into BlackRock platforms like Aladdin and eFront, providing clients with greater visibility into private markets such as infrastructure and private equity. Fink likened Preqin's role to Zillow's in the housing market, bringing transparency to an otherwise opaque investment landscape. This move could diversify BlackRock's revenue streams and potentially allow for the creation of private-market benchmarks and more accessible private index products (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* franchise, initially struggles to capture the stylistic flair of its predecessors, focusing on a generic revenge plot. Eve Macarro, played by Ana de Armas, seeks vengeance for her father's death and undergoes training similar to John Wick's. The film finds its stride when it shifts its focus to expanding the Wick universe, introducing a cultish village in the Austrian Alps where every inhabitant is a potential threat. Despite a somewhat underwhelming box office opening, *Ballerina* ultimately succeeds by embracing the bizarre and darkly cartoonish world that made the *John Wick* films popular.</p>

This shift underscores the growing emphasis on AI across industries, with companies racing to train employees on advanced AI tools.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help these birds, can be harmful or even deadly if not properly maintained. Sugar water left out too long can spoil and attract harmful microbes, leading to infections like candida, which can swell a hummingbird's tongue and make it difficult to eat. Experts recommend cleaning feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in the summer. The solution is to mix one part refined white sugar with four parts water, and to regularly clean the feeder with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture.</p>
