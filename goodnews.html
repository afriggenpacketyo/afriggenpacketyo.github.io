          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are participating in a "virtual athletes' village," living together in close quarters while competing in domestic championships. This approach is designed to acclimate them to the unfamiliar and often challenging environments of an Olympic village, fostering resilience and teamwork. Officials and athletes, including medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, noted the exercise was successful in building team morale and testing their ability to perform well under less-than-ideal conditions.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in primary schools across Kent, UK, is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future cases of melanoma skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates students on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, and cases are projected to rise. The program, supported by the charity Melanoma Fund, aims to instill lifelong habits and empower children to take responsibility for their own skin protection from an early age.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year career that was central to the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. This transition marks a strategic shift as Japan aims to become more competitive in the global satellite-launch market, which is increasingly dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>A massive crowd, estimated between 100,000 and 200,000 people, participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a significant demonstration for human rights and solidarity against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march using a controversial "Child Protection" law, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled it to proceed. Many attendees, including those from the broader community beyond LGBTQ+ individuals, were reportedly motivated to join specifically because of the attempted ban. The event was a peaceful but clear message of defiance against the government's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>

          <p>Japan's professional women's football competition, the WE League, concluded its fourth season with a record-breaking total attendance of over 337,000 spectators. This success is attributed to innovative promotional strategies, including collaborations with the men's J-League, such as a doubleheader event that drew over 26,000 fans. Individual clubs also led successful, player-driven campaigns to boost crowd numbers for specific matches. While still trailing top European leagues in average attendance, the WE League is demonstrating strong growth and is now focusing on data-driven marketing to continue its upward trajectory and build a larger fanbase.</p>

          <p>In his third pitching start of the season, Shohei Ohtani delivered his best performance yet, showcasing dominant potential despite the Dodgers ultimately losing to the Kansas City Royals. Ohtani pitched two scoreless innings, throwing a 101.7-mph fastball, the fastest of his MLB career, and effectively using his off-speed pitches. Although his workload is still limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, his performance was a major positive for the team. The outing demonstrated that his arm is responding well to the recovery process and that he could be an impactful pitcher for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist and former Microsoft AI head Harry Shum, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, despite still lagging significantly in advanced chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the technology race encompasses chips, algorithms, and applications. He highlighted that while the chip gap is substantial, Chinese companies like DeepSeek are achieving comparable results to top US firms with far less computing power. This suggests China is making significant strides by focusing on breakthroughs in algorithm engineering to overcome hardware constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has again denied President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the men formerly known as the Central Park Five. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which is designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he allegedly falsely claimed the men, who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated, had killed someone and pled guilty. This ruling allows the lawsuit against Trump to proceed.</p>
