The disruption, which impacted major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and Newark, was not related to cybersecurity concerns. United is treating the event as a preventable delay, meaning the airline will cover applicable customer expenses like hotels as it works to clear the backlog and return to normal operations.</p>

This economic activity comes amid an ongoing tariff truce with the United States, providing a positive signal for the nation's trade sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Wilmore, a veteran of three space missions, maintained a professional and committed stance throughout the ordeal, stating he was prepared for the extended duration.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated, if brief, return to the Hollywood Bowl, conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a program blending the works of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel. The concert featured pianist Seong-Jin Cho performing both of Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos. The orchestra, noted for its rare ability to swing, successfully tackled Ellington's symphonic poems "Harlem" and "Black, Brown and Beige," celebrating the 20th anniversary of Dudamel's U.S. debut at the iconic venue.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion. The announcement was made alongside President Trump, who praised the move as a step toward ensuring iPhones sold in America are also made in America. This pledge comes as Apple seeks to navigate the administration's threatened tariffs on foreign-made goods, which could significantly impact the tech giant's international supply chain.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from harm. The proposals include requiring clinics to obtain licenses to offer procedures like Botox and fillers, and restricting high-risk treatments such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) to qualified health professionals only. These new regulations, which will also include age restrictions, aim to address the lack of oversight that has led to dangerous complications and even death.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This trend is attributed to universities seeking the financial stability offered by three-year domestic undergraduates amid uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment. With universities making more offers, there is increased competition for UK students, providing them with more choice and flexibility during the admissions process.</p>
