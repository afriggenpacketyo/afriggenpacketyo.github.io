          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, six Labour MPs are competing to become the party's next deputy leader, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently seen as the frontrunner. Candidates must secure sufficient backing from fellow MPs and affiliated groups by a tight deadline to proceed to a member vote. The contest reflects internal party debates over its future direction, with candidates ranging from government loyalists to those from the party's left-wing, who are critical of the current leadership's policies.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that the new tax law signed by President Trump could result in an average tax cut of $3,752 for filers in 2026. The impact of these cuts will vary significantly by state, with residents in higher-income states like Wyoming potentially seeing the largest reductions. The law's provisions, such as a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, benefit residents of high-tax states, while the overall structure favors higher earners. (not investment advice)</p>

Postecoglou, who previously led Tottenham to a Europa League title, is now tasked with advancing the club's ambitions and competing for trophies. The club's owner expressed confidence that Postecoglou's credentials will help build upon the progress made under Nuno.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to restart cooperation regarding Iran's nuclear program, including the potential resumption of facility inspections. The deal, backed by Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog following an air war with Israel and the U.S. in June. This development is a crucial step toward restoring international oversight of Iran's nuclear activities, which has been a source of serious global concern, and aims to de-escalate regional tensions.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's record-breaking goal tally suggests his exceptional ability is rooted more in his movement than his finishing skill. While an incredible finisher, data shows that his primary advantage comes from his physical attributes and intelligent positioning, which allow him to get into superior scoring chances more often than other elite players. This consistent ability to generate high-probability shots for himself, rather than just converting them, is what truly sets him apart as a phenomenal goalscorer.</p>

          <p>Key inflation reports due this week are anticipated to show a rise in consumer and producer prices for August, driven largely by tariff-sensitive goods. Economists project this would push the annual headline inflation rate to 2.9%, but it is not expected to prevent the Federal Reserve from implementing an interest rate cut. Policymakers are likely to focus on the stable core inflation reading and a weakening jobs market, viewing the tariff-related price hikes as temporary rather than a long-term inflationary trend.

          <p>While credit card companies are unlikely to completely waive payments for customers who unexpectedly lose their jobs, many offer temporary hardship programs. These programs can provide relief by reducing minimum payments, lowering interest rates, or deferring payments for a set period, though interest may still accrue. To qualify, customers typically need to contact their issuer directly and provide documentation of their job loss. For those who cannot secure relief, options like credit counseling or debt settlement may offer alternative paths.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending all planned restaurant remodels after receiving negative customer feedback on its modernization efforts. This decision follows a recent controversy where the company faced widespread backlash for introducing a new, sleeker logo that removed its "Old Country Store" branding. The company quickly reverted to its old logo and has now halted the physical redesign of its stores to ensure they retain their popular "vintage Americana" feel, highlighting the risks of updating a beloved brand.</p>

          <p>A high-yield savings account with a $40,000 deposit could earn a significant amount of interest, potentially over $1,700 in one year at current top rates. These accounts offer much higher returns than traditional savings accounts, providing a secure place for funds while generating passive income. However, their interest rates are variable and expected to decline following anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, making projections uncertain over the long term.

          <p>With mortgage rates trending downward, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) can be an attractive option for homebuyers. ARMs currently offer significantly lower initial interest rates compared to traditional 30-year fixed-rate loans, allowing for lower monthly payments in the short term. This loan structure provides borrowers with a fixed rate for an initial period of seven or ten years, giving them time to gauge market trends and potentially refinance. An ARM can offer protection against short-term rate volatility while providing immediate cost savings. (not investment advice)</p>
