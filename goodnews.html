          <p>According to a recent World Bank report, Nigeria's GDP saw a 3.4% increase in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in a decade, primarily fueled by the recovering oil and gas sector and advancements in technology and finance. However, the report also cautioned that poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living below the poverty line, making it the country with the world's second-largest poor population after India. The agricultural sector is experiencing slow growth due to insecurity and high input costs, contributing to inflation, which is expected to remain above 20% throughout the year, impacting the purchasing power of ordinary Nigerians. President Tinubu's reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, are seen as positive steps but have resulted in a cost-of-living crisis for many citizens.</p>

          <p>Douglas "Pete" Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam, discusses his journey from captivity to becoming the first postwar U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. After being shot down and held for six and a half years, Peterson made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind and contribute to reconciliation between the two nations. He recounts his initial reluctance to take on the ambassadorship, fearing it would cause further issues, but found that his experience as a POW and congressman helped him build trust with Vietnamese diplomats. Peterson also highlights his work in improving safety for children in Asia through The Alliance for Safe Children, focusing on preventing accidental injuries and death.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs, fueled by factors like unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical tensions, and rising inflationary pressures. Investors are increasingly viewing gold as a safe haven asset, leading to a surge in demand for physical gold and Exchange Traded Funds. Central banks have also been significant buyers, seeking to diversify their reserves amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty and fears of weaponization of the dollar system. While some experts predict further price increases, others warn of a potential market bubble, drawing parallels to past surges followed by significant price corrections (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Doctors and researchers are grappling with the question of who should be prescribed GLP-1 drugs, given their effectiveness in inducing weight loss but also their high cost, potential side effects, and the need for lifelong use. The article argues that the primary goal should be improving health, not just achieving weight loss, and that GLP-1 drugs are most beneficial for individuals with excess visceral fat who are experiencing its negative health consequences. Physicians should focus on identifying those with high visceral fat through measures like waist size and blood-lipid patterns, rather than relying solely on BMI. The article emphasizes the need for more data on how to safely discontinue GLP-1 drugs and the importance of considering lifestyle changes and other medications as alternatives.</p>

The proposal builds on his previous "most favored nation" concept, aiming to pay the lowest price available globally.

          <p>A museum dedicated to the Holocaust and the history of Jews in the region has opened in Brnƒõnec, Czech Republic, at the site where Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews during World War II. The museum, called the Museum of Survivors, is housed in a renovated spinning mill and displays the history of Schindler, his wife Emilie, the L√∂w-Beer family, and testimonies of Holocaust survivors. The opening coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and aims to create a universal place for survivors' stories to be told and for people to form their own opinions.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Race to Discover Why the Universe Exists</h2>

          <p>Scientists in the US and Japan are competing to discover why the universe exists by studying neutrinos, sub-atomic particles, and their antimatter opposites. The US-based Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) involves building vast underground caverns to shield sensitive equipment from external noise and radiation. As they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly, and scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The Japanese-led Hyper K experiment, an upgraded version of the existing Super K detector, is expected to begin operating sooner, providing an earlier opportunity for discoveries.</p>

          <p>Japan is experiencing a surge in gold investment as concerns rise over a global economic slowdown caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Investors are seeking safe assets, such as gold, that are seen as unlikely to plummet during times of economic turbulence. The benchmark price of gold in yen terms hit an all-time high in April, and products linked to gold price movements have become popular among investment trusts covered by Japan's tax exemption program for private investors (not investment advice).</p>
