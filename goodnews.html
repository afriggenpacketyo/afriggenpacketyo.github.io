          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh is attempting to become the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, a 62-mile feat intended to raise awareness about the importance of shark conservation. Pugh aims to challenge the negative portrayal of sharks popularized by the film "Jaws," which was filmed in the area. He emphasizes the need to protect sharks, highlighting that approximately 100 million are killed each year. Despite facing frigid waters and inclement weather, Pugh is accompanied by a safety team and a "Shark Shield" device to ensure his safety during the swim.</p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering temporarily accepting international students from Harvard University should the U.S. government bar them from studying there. The university previously launched a program in 2022 to host researchers and students affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing research facilities and accommodation. This potential acceptance follows the Trump administration's move to end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, although a U.S. federal court has issued a temporary injunction pending review of the legality of the decision. The University of Tokyo is still exploring the details of the proposed arrangement.</p>

          <p>A contributor to the LA Times reflects on their experience as a state government official in Minnesota during the COVID-19 pandemic, where they had to claw back unemployment insurance payments from high school students due to an outdated law. The author describes how students, a rural Republican senator, and the AARP came together to change the law and retroactively allow young workers to keep the payments. The story illustrates the power of local action and collaboration in solving problems, especially during times of declining trust in national institutions.

          <p>A new book, "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and screen patients is creating problems, with doctors often too quick to label conditions. Author Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan advocates for "slow medicine," emphasizing the importance of building relationships with patients, monitoring symptoms, and exercising caution before assigning a diagnosis. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments and anxiety. O'Sullivan acknowledges the need to balance technological advancements with a more measured approach to clinical practice, ensuring that diagnoses are made with careful consideration and understanding of the patient's story.</p>
