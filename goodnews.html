          <p>Stock markets experienced a surge after a federal court blocked President Trump's tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The ruling invalidated levies unveiled in a Rose Garden ceremony and a 10% tariff imposed on goods from nearly all countries. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, creating uncertainty about the tariffs' ultimate fate. The court's decision centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, and even before the ruling, some tariffs had been rolled back due to trade agreements.

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio is spearheading a major reorganization of the State Department, aiming to cut or consolidate over 300 offices and bureaus to streamline the agency and enhance its diplomatic mission. The restructuring seeks to reduce bureaucratic red tape, emphasize the agency's role in representing the U.S. abroad, and eliminate bureaucratic overgrowth. The plan involves slashing or merging 40% of domestic offices, potentially affecting 15% to 20% of the agency's domestic personnel. The reorganization also includes adding new offices, such as a bureau of emerging threats, and shifting focus towards embassies to implement "America First" diplomacy.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* argues that the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to strike down almost all of President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law. The author emphasizes that the Constitution delegates tariff power to Congress, not the presidency, and that the court's ruling merely affirmed Congress's power. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit included multiple states, and the Court of International Trade was specifically created to handle trade disputes. The article asserts that the administration's criticism of the judiciary suggests contempt for any check on presidential power.</p>

Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Looking forward, Nvidia is focusing on AI inference, where its GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers, and its latest Blackwell chips are designed for this purpose. (not investment advice)</p>

The remains, including a skull and separated bones, have been sent to the Medical University of South Carolina for forensic analysis and identification. Bones have been found on the island before, and broken tools and building materials from the settlement's past often wash up on the shore.</p>
