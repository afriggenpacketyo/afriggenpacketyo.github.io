        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's foreign minister indicated that Berlin is prepared to meet President Trump's demand for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP. Currently, NATO members are committed to spending at least 2% of GDP on military expenditure, a target that many countries still do not meet. Germany currently spends just over 2% of its GDP on defense, and Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that each additional percentage point would mean further annual expenditure of ‚Ç¨45 billion. Some countries consider the 5% target unrealistic, leading to suggestions of a compromise involving increased spending on defense-related infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has approved a $433 million joint venture between Foxconn and HCL Group to establish a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, India, with operations expected to begin by 2027. The facility will produce display driver chips used in mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and other consumer electronics, with a capacity of up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips per month. This deal is part of India's "Semiconductor Mission" to build a robust chips and display ecosystem, as Apple suppliers like Foxconn increasingly shift production away from China amid trade tensions. India aims to account for 15%-20% of total iPhone production by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that India has purportedly offered a trade deal that would eliminate all tariffs on goods imported from the United States. Speaking at an event in Doha, Trump mentioned that he had advised Apple CEO Tim Cook against expanding production in India, stating Apple would instead increase production in the United States. India and the US are currently negotiating a trade agreement, with Delhi having already lowered tariffs on certain US products; however, the US maintains a $45 billion trade deficit with India. India has recently signed trade deals with the UK and the European Free Trade Association.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 0.6%, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the growth primarily to the services sector, with significant contributions from production. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that this strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic strength, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employer's National Insurance payments.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons to combat near-record high rice prices caused by a supply shortfall. This would involve releasing 300,000 tons over three months through July, in addition to 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The increased release could reduce the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests or natural disasters. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements to encourage more participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, but the looming threat of U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry is not a major factor. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that Denmark will be protected from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, as most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country, nor cross its borders. The IMF projects medium-term growth at around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>
