          <p>Despite a strong rebound in the tech sector following an early selloff, Apple's stock has underperformed compared to other major tech companies.

Analysts suggest that geopolitical events present buying opportunities in tech, particularly in AI-related stocks.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut in July if inflation remains contained. Bowman believes that President Trump's tariffs will likely have a limited impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates. Her comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, who also suggested a potential cut in July. While Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates, the FOMC voted to hold rates steady at its last meeting. The article gives the impression that an interest rate cut could be possible.</p>
