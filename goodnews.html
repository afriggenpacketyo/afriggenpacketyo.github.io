          <p>Kohl's Corporation has terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest with a vendor, leading to financial transactions and a consulting agreement involving an individual with whom he had a personal relationship.

Hagar expressed frustration over Roth's behavior, claiming Roth would call in sick just before his scheduled performances, leading Hagar to take the stage to avoid disappointing fans. Hagar also criticized Roth's performance choices, noting that Roth should have represented himself as a solo artist rather than simply performing his Van Halen show from 1983.

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has become the head of four government bodies: Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of U.S.A.I.D., Acting Archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and Interim National Security Advisor. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage these roles, especially under President Trump's unconventional governing style. The sudden appointment was unexpected, even to State Department officials, and underscores the trust placed in Rubio by Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles. The situation prompts practical concerns about delegation, salary, and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

A shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program led to the request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.
