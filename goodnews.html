          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have detected a candidate gas giant planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest sun-like star to Earth. This discovery is notable because the fictional world of Pandora from the "Avatar" movies is set in this same star system. The planet appears to be in the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could potentially support life, leading to speculation about the possibility of life-sustaining moons. However, scientists emphasize that the planet's existence still requires further confirmation through additional observations.</p>

          <p>Seniors navigating retirement are assessing various financial tools to manage rising costs and ensure long-term stability. Social Security provides a foundational income but is often insufficient on its own, making supplementary strategies necessary. Annuities offer a guaranteed income stream, similar to a personal pension, which can provide peace of mind for those fearing they might outlive their savings. Meanwhile, reverse mortgages allow house-rich, cash-poor seniors to tap into their home equity, though this option reduces the value of their estate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose steep secondary tariffs on countries like India and China for purchasing Russian energy exports. Traders seem to view the threats, including a 25% tariff on India, as a negotiating tactic rather than a policy that will be fully implemented. Analysts suggest that if the tariffs were enforced, they would significantly disrupt global supply and cause prices to spike, which would contradict Trump's goal of lowering energy costs. The market's calm response indicates a belief that a deal will be reached or that the administration will ultimately back down. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peloton surprised investors by posting a profitable fiscal fourth quarter, driven by cost-cutting measures and better-than-expected sales. Under new CEO Peter Stern, the company plans to reduce expenses by an additional $100 million, which will involve laying off 6% of its global workforce. This move follows previous efforts to stabilize the business after its pandemic-era boom. The company's full-year guidance suggests a path to revenue growth, although it faces headwinds from new tariffs on imported goods. Peloton is also shifting its retail strategy towards smaller "micro-stores" and expanding its wellness offerings beyond fitness equipment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has agreed to a deal with German club RB Leipzig to sign 22-year-old Slovenian forward Benjamin Sesko for a fee of £73.7 million. The transfer includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3 million, with the rest structured as add-ons. Sesko, who has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig, will finalize the move after completing a medical. This signing is part of a significant summer spending spree for United, which has already acquired forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, funded in part by creative payment structures and player sales.</p>

          <h2>New Archaeological Finds in Pompeii Suggest Survivors Returned to Live Amidst Ruins</h2>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered new evidence indicating that some survivors of the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to Pompeii to live. It is believed these individuals, unable to afford relocating, established an informal settlement in "precarious conditions" among the ruins. The findings suggest they repurposed the ground floors of old homes into cellars with ovens and mills, while living on the upper floors. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative of complete abandonment, revealing a more complex story of survival and resettlement in the devastated city before it was ultimately deserted centuries later.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's decision to cut its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4% will have direct financial implications for UK households. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages will likely see their monthly payments decrease, offering some relief. However, the rate cut is unwelcome news for savers, as interest rates on savings accounts are expected to fall further, diminishing returns on their deposits. The move is part of the central bank's effort to balance controlling inflation, which remains above its 2% target, with stimulating a sluggish economy and a weakening jobs market.</p>

Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, recently won a major NASA contract and successfully landed its "Blue Ghost" lander on the moon.

          <p>New Zealand's air force conducted a perilous, nearly 20-hour rescue mission to evacuate three people requiring medical care from the U.S. McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The operation was carried out in sub-zero temperatures and the complete darkness of the Antarctic winter, with U.S. officials calling the crew's actions "nothing short of heroic." The C-130J Hercules crew used night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway. Such mid-winter flights are considered extremely challenging due to the harsh, unpredictable weather and the difficulty of operating on ice, making this a remarkable feat of international cooperation and skill.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates, despite inflation remaining well above its 2% target, was a closely contested move. The primary justification is the Bank's medium-term forecast, which sees weakening pressure on inflation from the labor market due to a rise in unemployment and a fall in job vacancies. However, the move is risky with current inflation still high, and it prompted dissent from two members of the rate-setting committee. The Bank hopes the cut will help stimulate a sluggish economy, which has been weighed down by a high savings rate and weak consumer confidence.</p>
