          <h2>Financial Experts Weigh the Merits of Investing in 10-Year CDs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 09:38:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising caution regarding 10-year certificates of deposit (CDs), despite their potential to lock in current high interest rates for a decade. In the present economic climate, shorter-term CDs often provide equal or superior returns, diminishing the traditional advantage of long-term commitments. While 10-year CDs can offer a safe, low-risk option for long-term savings goals, they come with significant downsides, including early withdrawal penalties and the opportunity cost of missing out on higher returns from investments like stocks or bonds. Experts suggest savers carefully consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before choosing this option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lottie Woad, the world's top-ranked amateur golfer from England, has officially turned professional, forgoing significant prize money from recent high-profile finishes. The 21-year-old made the decision after securing third place at the Evian Championship and winning the Irish Open, which collectively would have earned her nearly £500,000. Her exceptional performance has already secured her playing privileges on both the LPGA Tour and the Ladies European Tour. Woad will make her professional debut at the Scottish Open before competing in the AIG Women's Open.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank's net income rose 25% to $4.02 billion, with earnings per share at $1.96 against an estimated $1.60. Strong performance in equity and fixed income trading, which benefited from market volatility, contributed to the positive results, with total markets revenue up 16%. Despite the strong quarter, the bank also noted a 16% increase in the cost of credit, citing a "deterioration" in the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has announced a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to source rare earth magnets and develop a recycling facility, strengthening its U.S. supply chain. Under the deal, MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the United States, will supply magnets from its Texas facility starting in 2027. This partnership is a significant step in reducing U.S. reliance on China for these critical components, which are essential for products like smartphones and computers. The investment aligns with Apple's broader plan to bolster U.S. manufacturing and the Department of Defense's efforts to secure a domestic supply of vital minerals.</p>

          <p>During an interview at the FIFA Club World Cup final, President Donald Trump remarked that he could potentially issue an executive order to change the official U.S. term for soccer to "football." While the comment was made in a lighthearted manner, it reflects the sport's growing prominence in America, which is set to co-host the World Cup next year. Trump, who appeared on stage with the winning team Chelsea, also praised the sport for its unifying quality and its ability to bring countries together.

Recent statements indicate a commitment to continue arming Ukraine and a threat of 100% tariffs on Russia if a peace deal is not reached, suggesting a tougher stance than many of his critics would expect. The author notes that while Trump has expressed personal admiration for Vladimir Putin, his first administration's policies were often at odds with Russian interests. This potential evolution in his second term challenges the persistent narrative that he is sympathetic to Putin's objectives.</p>

          <p>Linn Ullmann's new book, "Girl, 1983," is reviewed as a profound exploration of memory, amnesia, and the nature of autobiographical storytelling. The work, labeled a novel despite its clear parallels to Ullmann's own life, centers on a writer trying to reconstruct a painful adolescent experience with a much older photographer that she can't fully recall. The review praises Ullmann's manipulation of genre to express the vulnerability of memory, suggesting that by embracing the gaps and forgotten details, she challenges the idea that memoir can ever be purely factual. The book is presented as a powerful meditation on how experiences persist not just as memories, but as potent absences.</p>
