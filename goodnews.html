          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market is defying the national slump, with wealthy buyers investing in luxury homes as value-preserving assets. One Central Park, a luxury development in Shanghai's Huangpu district, sold all 64 units for 4 billion yuan, averaging 185,000 yuan per square meter. Demand for luxury homes remains strong across the city, with new home prices in Shanghai outpacing national averages in April and May. Premium projects like Swire Properties' Lujiazui Taikoo Yuan Residences and Greentown China's Symphony Shanghai sold out quickly upon launch.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road, a scenic section of Highway 120, will reopen for Memorial Day weekend after being closed since November due to ice and snow. The reopening is earlier than in previous years, but cyclists will not have early access. Visitors planning to enter the park between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. during the holiday weekend will need a reservation and should expect delays. The park is also facing potential staffing shortages due to budget cuts at the National Park Service.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Dog Owner's Work Stress to Anxiety in Their Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with high job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one individual to another, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin struggled with command, issuing walks that loaded the bases before Soto's hit. David Peterson, the Mets' starter, pitched effectively, limiting the Dodgers' offense. The Dodgers' bullpen, already overworked, faced further strain, highlighting the team's reliance on their starters' performance.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions and increase salaries for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to attract talent amid growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine. The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs will have the option for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasizes the significant role of chefs in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, calling them 'food diplomats.' The goal is to fill vacancies and enable chefs to pursue their careers more easily.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," it refrains from promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits. The SWR trains will now be managed by DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing, and the Conservatives have called for Labour to deliver on its promises.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, fewer than the city needs due to a years-long staffing shortage. The city expects more lifeguards to join as summer progresses, with incentives like increased hourly wages and signing bonuses. Despite the shortage, officials are prepared to make accommodations to ensure safety. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, even with the limited numbers, as it provides a sense of security.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," passed away at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, influencing laws and societal attitudes. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, challenging male-generated myths and prompting discussions on feminism, power dynamics, and social responsibility. Her contributions to the women's movement and her impact on the understanding of sexual assault are significant.</p>
