          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his "Complete and Total Endorsement" of U.S. Senator Ashley Moody, appointed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to fill Marco Rubio's former seat. Moody, who previously supported Trump-backed legislation, expressed honor for the President's backing and affirmed her commitment to strengthening the nation. This significant endorsement comes as Senator Moody prepares for a special election next year, where Florida voters will decide who represents them for the remainder of the term. Her campaign aims to address key issues such as inflation, government spending, and border security, signaling her priorities for the upcoming political contest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump expressed confidence that the Federal Reserve will soon begin lowering interest rates, following a recent meeting with Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump described the meeting as positive, interpreting Powell's comments about the economy's strength as a signal for impending monetary easing, despite the Fed's previous caution regarding inflation. While the White House continues to advocate for a review of the central bank's management, Trump has softened his stance on Powell's position. However, futures markets indicate low expectations for an immediate rate cut, with a potential move not anticipated until September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fountains Evolve from Ancient Utility and Symbolism to Modern Urban Cooling Solutions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 10:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fountains boast a rich history spanning nearly five millennia, evolving from practical water sources in ancient Minoan and Islamic gardens to grand symbolic spectacles of the Renaissance. Historically, they served utilitarian, sacred, and social functions, often featuring motifs like lion spouts. In modern times, iconic performing fountains, such as those at the Bellagio, captivate audiences with choreographed water displays. As Europe faces intensifying heatwaves, cities are adapting existing fountains for localized cooling through misting nozzles and recirculated water, highlighting their enduring relevance as both aesthetic features and functional elements in urban environments.</p>

          <p>Germany faces criticism for its stagnant trade relations and lack of a clear strategic approach in Africa, potentially missing significant economic and geopolitical opportunities. While competitors like China, India, and Gulf States are rapidly expanding their investments and trade, German exports have shown minimal growth for a decade. Africa's rising demand for infrastructure and raw materials, crucial for green and digital transformations, is largely benefiting other global powers. Experts urge Germany to adopt a coherent Africa strategy, emphasizing sustainable partnerships to leverage its reputation and avoid falling further behind.</p>

          <p>Late-life depression, though often stigmatized and misdiagnosed as physical ailments, presents symptoms similar to those in younger adults, including fatigue and social withdrawal. Experts note that somatic symptoms are more prevalent in older adults, potentially delaying recognition and leading to chronic manifestation. Social factors like changes in status and loss contribute to its onset. Treatment options include medication and psychotherapy, though medication for older adults requires careful consideration due to potential interactions. Challenges in research, such as excluding vulnerable patients from trials, hinder progress in understanding and treating this complex condition.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker shared her early career experience of meticulously making $40 last for three days, emphasizing the profound importance of financial security. After moving out at 18 with limited savings, she learned to budget judiciously while navigating auditions, recognizing the "security in being able to pay your bills." Financial experts suggest that for freelancers or gig workers with unpredictable incomes, a "bucketing strategy"—allocating percentages of earnings to essentials, savings, and discretionary spending—is more effective than strict daily rationing. Building an emergency fund and actively seeking income growth opportunities are crucial for long-term financial stability.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering attractive returns, with top high-yield accounts providing significantly higher Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) than the national average. While the national average for a one-year CD is 2.04%, some online banks offer rates up to 4.45%. This makes CDs an appealing option for savers looking to lock in strong returns that outpace inflation, especially as short-term CDs currently offer better rates than longer terms due to an inverted yield curve. Investors are advised to compare online banks for the best rates and consider laddering CDs for optimized returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold stands at $3,342.20 per ounce today, with its value influenced by a complex interplay of factors including supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, and inflation rates.

Interest rates, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies also significantly impact its fluctuations. Investors frequently turn to physical gold, such as bars and coins, as it historically retains its value, making it a strategic choice during volatile financial periods. (not investment advice)</p>
