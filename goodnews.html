          <p>Duke basketball phenomenon Cooper Flagg, projected as a top NBA draft pick, discussed overcoming early doubts about his ability to succeed due to his upbringing in Maine, where few basketball stars originate. Flagg emphasized that hard work and self-belief are more important than geographical origin, citing Duncan Robinson and Jeff Turner as examples of players with Maine ties who reached professional levels. He led Duke in multiple statistical categories and earned the Naismith Player of the Year Award as a freshman. Flagg's journey underscores the importance of perseverance in achieving ambitious goals, inspiring others to pursue their dreams regardless of their background.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. Trump expressed hope for Syria's future and urged al-Sharaa to normalize ties with Israel and combat terrorism. The meeting, joined by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signals a potential shift in U.S. policy toward Syria. Al-Sharaa, who previously led an al-Qaeda-linked rebel group, has vowed to rebuild the country and invited American investment in Syrian oil and gas.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are set to face a 17% increase in their homeowners insurance premiums, following a judge's ruling and approval by the California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. This increase is intended to alleviate the company's financial strain resulting from the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The decision grants State Farm a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company. While some criticize the decision as disregarding the hardships faced by fire victims, Lara emphasized the need to protect State Farm customers and the integrity of the insurance market during a statewide insurance crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Menendez brothers' resentencing has sparked a re-examination of the 1990s, the decade in which they were initially tried and convicted for the murder of their parents. Their lawyer argued that the punitive criminal justice policies of that era influenced their sentencing, and that current sensibilities might warrant a second chance. The case, which was heavily publicized and mocked in popular culture at the time, has gained renewed interest due to Netflix shows and social media campaigns. With George Gasc√≥n, who supported resentencing, having lost his re-election bid, the case now rests with Governor Newsom, who has expressed interest in the Menendez brothers' situation.</p>
