          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 08:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, after his predecessor was dismissed for insensitive comments about receiving gifted rice. The average price of rice in supermarkets has remained high due to a poor harvest in 2023, reaching a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms. Many respondents believe that rice prices should be brought below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, which is lower than the target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey also indicates a slight increase in support for Ishiba's Cabinet.</p>
