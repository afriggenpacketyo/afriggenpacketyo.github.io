          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 03:03:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent influx of young Chinese immigrants to Paris is transforming the city's culinary landscape, leading to a boom in restaurants serving authentic regional Chinese food. Unlike older establishments that often catered to Western tastes, new venues like Tonton Mao are targeting a younger demographic with specific dishes like kaochuan from northeastern China. These restaurants are focused on authenticity, often flying in chefs from China and recreating traditional decor. This trend reflects a shift in the city's Chinese diaspora and is expanding the diversity of the Parisian food scene beyond traditional French and Cantonese fare.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting £5.4 billion in new capital to improve services and infrastructure. The investors state the plan would stabilize the company without requiring taxpayer funding and includes a commitment to pay outstanding fines and halt dividend payments during the turnaround period. This move comes amid long-standing fears over the utility's financial stability and pressure to address its performance issues.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rain to the island before weakening to a Category 1 and moving back out into the Atlantic. As of early Thursday, the storm's center had moved away from Bermuda, though a hurricane warning remained in effect. The storm was expected to bring 2 to 4 inches of rain, with potential for flash flooding. While hurricane-force winds were recorded, there were no immediate reports of significant damage. Swells generated by Imelda are also affecting the U.S. East Coast, causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.</p>

          <p>AI research lab OpenAI has finalized a secondary share sale allowing employees to sell $6.6 billion worth of stock, a transaction that values the company at a record $500 billion. This deal cements OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. The sale, which saw participation from investors like Thrive Capital and SoftBank, is viewed internally as a sign of strong long-term confidence, as not all authorized shares were sold. Such secondary sales are an increasingly common strategy for high-profile startups to retain talent by providing liquidity without pursuing an IPO.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are preparing for future lunar exploration by testing and training four-legged robotic dogs in environments that simulate conditions on the moon. The tests are being conducted in a lava tube cave in Heilongjiang province, which closely resembles the underground lunar landscapes considered ideal for future human bases. These robotic "scouts" are designed to navigate narrow passages inaccessible to humans, performing surveying and exploration tasks. This initiative is part of China's broader effort to advance its deep-space exploration capabilities through the development of embodied artificial intelligence technologies.</p>

He argues that these models are designed to predict the most likely next word and often align with user prompts, which is contrary to the contrarian thinking that drives novel scientific discovery. Wolf suggests that true scientific progress requires predicting unlikely yet true outcomes, a capability today's AI lacks.

Phillipson emphasized the "real urgency" to address the issue, as it is a significant driver of rising child poverty rates.
