          <p>A federal appeals court is currently deliberating on the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The court is reviewing a lower court's ruling that found the president overstepped his authority, with judges questioning the unprecedented use of IEEPA for tariffs, a power constitutionally vested in Congress. Challengers, including states and small businesses, argue the move represents an unbounded claim to power that disrupts the established trade framework. The administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national emergencies. (not investment advice)</p>

The crew, commanded by Zena Cardman, will now await the next launch window, which is also threatened by potentially poor weather.

          <p>A late-stage trial by Eli Lilly showed its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, offered significant heart health benefits when compared directly with its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity in reducing major cardiovascular events and also showed a notable 16% lower rate of death from any cause and better kidney protection. While the primary goal was non-inferiority, the company believes these comprehensive benefits strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease. The results could further solidify Mounjaro's market position.</p>

          <p>Chaplain Joon Park of Tampa General Hospital in Florida provides spiritual care to patients facing end-of-life situations, offering a unique perspective on faith during crises. Having come to his calling from an atheist background and a difficult childhood, Park believes the hospital is a sacred space where profound spiritual experiences occur. He observes that while some patients find renewed faith in their final moments, others express anger at God, and he validates both as legitimate spiritual responses. For Park, the presence of love and care in the face of immense suffering is a powerful reflection of the divine.</p>

This move temporarily maintains a 25% tariff on certain goods and a 50% tariff on key metals. Separately, the president signed an executive order to expand the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition and reinstate the Presidential Fitness Test in schools.

Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined with Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for an 8-7 vote to move the bill forward. The proposal, called the Honest Act, aims to address public concerns about potential conflicts of interest and insider trading by lawmakers. The vote prompted a heated exchange among Republicans, while President Trump offered a mixed and later critical response to the bill.</p>

The decision was made after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. During this period, existing tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars and a 50% tariff on metals, will remain in place.

This article explains that the condition, first identified in the 1970s, is common among those in technical fields and can lead to anxiety and burnout. To combat these feelings, it suggests three strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and joining a professional community for peer support.
