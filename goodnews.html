          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convened to address currency matters intertwined with ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, reaching a consensus that the current dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects underlying economic conditions. This acknowledgement implies that the yen's recent depreciation against the dollar should not be a focal point in tariff discussions, diverging from President Trump's earlier assertions that yen weakness unfairly advantages Japanese exporters. The ministers also reaffirmed their shared conviction that exchange rates should be determined by market forces, refraining from discussing specific exchange rate targets. Japan continues to strongly oppose additional tariffs imposed by the U.S., while considering options to concede to lower tariff rates to expedite a deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump Gold Card, a $5 million visa program, will soon be available online, with a website expected to launch in weeks. This program aims to attract wealthy individuals worldwide, offering them a path to U.S. citizenship in exchange for a significant investment. Lutnick emphasized that applicants will undergo thorough vetting and that this initiative could generate substantial revenue for America, potentially helping to reduce the national debt. Critics, however, have raised concerns about potential fraud and national security risks associated with the program. The Gold Card initiative is being launched amidst broader debates about immigration policy and its economic impacts.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa remained composed during a meeting with President Trump, where Trump unexpectedly confronted him with claims of persecution against white South Africans. Trump dimmed the lights, screened a video, and presented news clippings to support his allegations, echoing his aggressive treatment of other foreign leaders. Despite the choreographed onslaught of accusations, Ramaphosa maintained his composure and attempted to correct Trump's misrepresentations. This incident highlights the challenges foreign leaders face when engaging with Trump, who often deviates from diplomatic norms and amplifies controversial narratives.</p>

          <p>A New York Police inspector, Terrell Anderson, was transferred after allowing dozens of prospective officers to proceed in the hiring process despite failing to meet mental health standards. Anderson, who commanded the candidate assessment division, reportedly overrode negative psychological reports for 80 candidates. This decision comes as the NYPD faces a shortage of officers, with the department's head count declining since 2020. Anderson has been cited for excellent or meritorious police duty 38 times and is known for his efforts to recruit more officers of color.</p>
