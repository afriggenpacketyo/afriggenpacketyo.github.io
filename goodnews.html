          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors processed the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, which introduced a period of political uncertainty but prompted a rise in the Nikkei 225 index. Market watchers are also closely anticipating key economic data from the region, particularly China's trade figures for August, to gauge economic health. Meanwhile, oil prices experienced a slight increase after OPEC+ announced it would continue to lift production in October, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months. U.S. stock futures remained stable as investors prepared for upcoming inflation reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Lowestoft, Suffolk, experienced the shock of her life when she gave birth in a football club toilet, having had no idea she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson was attending a match when she felt a sudden urge to push and delivered her son, Henry, in a cubicle. Medical experts explain this is a rare phenomenon known as a cryptic pregnancy, affecting about one in 2,500 births, where the mother remains unaware of the baby until late in term or during labor. An off-duty paramedic and other attendees assisted until an ambulance arrived, turning a local football event into the site of an unexpected miracle.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a bad back that sidelined him for much of the preseason, quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-9 victory against the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, becoming the 10th quarterback in NFL history to surpass 60,000 career passing yards. The Rams' defense sealed the win in the final two minutes when linebacker Nate Landman forced a crucial fumble that was recovered by Braden Fiske. The victory provided a much-needed positive start for the team after a season opener that was marked by some sloppy play and injuries.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are embracing "living apart together" (LAT) arrangements, maintaining strong marriages despite not sharing a home, and sometimes even living in different countries. The article highlights the story of Margaret, who lives in London while her husband resides in Australia, a situation they have successfully managed for 15 years through regular communication. This lifestyle choice, also adopted by some high-profile figures like Gwyneth Paltrow and Sheryl Lee Ralph, allows individuals to pursue separate career and personal goals while remaining committed. Experts note that for some, this provides a healthy balance of personal space and companionship.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring the preservation of the landmark where Walt Disney famously conceived the idea for Disneyland. The merry-go-round, built in 1926, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator and is in need of significant repairs. As one of the few remaining four-across carousels of its kind with original features, its acquisition is part of a broader restoration plan for the park ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. The city aims to have the beloved attraction spinning again in time for its centennial in 2026.</p>

          <p>According to Bank of America, global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly moving capital into Asian markets. This shift is reportedly driven by the burgeoning artificial intelligence boom in the region, more attractive valuations compared to U.S. stocks, and expectations of an easing monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve. After a period where U.S. markets attracted $1.2 trillion, investment flows are now balancing out between domestic and international funds. The global AI market is projected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a significant portion expected to be deployed in Asia-Pacific. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, Australia, and parts of Europe and Africa were treated to a total lunar eclipse, which caused the moon to appear a deep red color, a phenomenon commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The event occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface. The reddish hue is a result of sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and illuminate the moon. While the Americas missed this total eclipse, some regions were able to observe a partial eclipse.</p>

Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill expressed disappointment with the result but pride in his team's performance, noting that his side was well in the game for over an hour before Germany pulled away.</p>

At their recent state convention, party members were energized to fight the measure, which they argue is a Democratic attempt to rig the 2026 election. If approved by voters in a November special election, Proposition 50 could cost Republicans up to five seats in the U.S. House, potentially determining control of Congress. The campaign against the measure has brought together different factions of the state's GOP, which sees this as a fight for political survival.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, argues that globalization is not dead but is instead becoming more regionalized and centered in Asia. In a recent interview, he stated that the continent's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin suggests that while the U.S. may be attempting to distance itself, Asia's continued success demonstrates that globalization is "alive and well" in the region. He also cautioned that the interconnectedness that brings benefits also increases shared risks, such as pandemics. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer argues that investors would be more profitable focusing on company fundamentals rather than reacting to the president's political initiatives and cultural battles. He points to the recent weak jobs report, noting that while some may blame Trump's policies, the complexities of the economy are driven by many other factors, such as Federal Reserve policy and infrastructure spending.

While some commentators believe he needs more experience in red-ball cricket to prove his Test credentials, his undeniable talent and recent form are creating a selection dilemma. England's management has identified Bethell as a future leader, but it remains uncertain if his recent runs will be enough to displace an incumbent player.</p>
