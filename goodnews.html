          <p>Amazon's palm scanning technology, Amazon One, is being implemented in various locations, including NYU Langone Health hospitals and clinics, allowing individuals to verify their identity by waving their hand over a sensor. While Amazon assures that palm data is separate from Amazon.com profiles and not used for marketing, privacy watchdogs caution that the vast reach of Amazon's data collection across its various businesses could lead to the inference of sensitive healthcare information. The article discusses the convenience and security aspects of biometric scanning, but also raises concerns about the potential misuse of biometric data by tech giants. The overall tone is cautionary, reflecting the balance between convenience and privacy risks.</p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise has announced plans to move its primary listing location to the U.S., which is a blow to the London stock exchange. Wise stated in its full-year earnings statement that it will move to a dual listing, with its main listing hub shifting to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. The company said this move would allow Wise's shares to trade on both a US stock exchange and the LSE. Shares of Wise traded almost 11% higher following the announcement.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the narrative of the "China shock," which claims that trade with China gutted American manufacturing, is exaggerated and not supported by rigorous evidence. The article cites research suggesting that the negative effects of trade with China have been overstated and that the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry. The author contends that technological advances and shifting consumer demand were the primary drivers of manufacturing job losses, and that many displaced workers transitioned successfully into other sectors. The optimism score reflects the potential for harnessing trade's benefits rather than pursuing misguided protectionism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering legislation to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes from financial collapse following the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. AB 226 would make the FAIR Plan eligible for loans and bonds from the state-backed California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. Other bills aim to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. Lawmakers approved $2.5 billion in wildfire aid and are working on measures to ease the permit process for rebuilding and extend tenancy rights for those in temporary housing.</p>
