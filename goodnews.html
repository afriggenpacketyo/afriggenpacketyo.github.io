          <p>English flanker Abi Burton has made an emotional debut at the Rugby World Cup, marking a remarkable comeback just three years after a rare medical condition left her in a coma. Diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, Burton was placed in a medically-induced coma for nearly four weeks and had to relearn how to walk and talk upon waking. Her journey from intensive rehabilitation to signing with a professional club and ultimately representing her country highlights an incredible story of resilience and determination against overwhelming odds. The moment was especially poignant for her family, who supported her through the ordeal.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open higher, rebounding from a previous session where fiscal concerns in the U.K. and France drove bond yields to their highest levels in decades. The rise in borrowing costs, such as the U.K.'s 30-year bond yield hitting a 1998 peak, has created market nervousness. This trend is also influenced by global factors, including uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade tariffs and their potential impact on the American fiscal situation. Investors are closely monitoring these developments while awaiting new corporate earnings and inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The lively and sometimes boisterous crowds at the US Open in New York have reignited discussions about on-court etiquette within the world of professional tennis. Incidents involving underarm serves, reactions to net-cord winners, and heated exchanges between players have highlighted a cultural clash over sportsmanship. Some players, like Stefanos Tsitsipas, have expressed frustration with tactics they view as disrespectful, while others see them as legitimate strategies in a high-stakes environment. The unique, high-energy atmosphere of Flushing Meadows often amplifies these tensions, making player conduct a central topic of conversation at the year's final Grand Slam tournament.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot utilize the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of individuals his administration accuses of being members of a Venezuelan gang. A panel for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with lower court decisions that the law, intended for use during declared wars, does not apply to modern criminal organizations like Tren de Aragua. This ruling represents a significant legal obstacle for a key administration immigration policy. The administration had argued that courts should not second-guess the president's determination of a national security threat.</p>

          <p>Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and marking the quickest growth rate since September 2023. The growth was primarily fueled by strong domestic spending from both households and government sectors, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This positive economic data comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates and adopted a more optimistic tone regarding the economy's resilience. Despite the strong performance, some analysts caution that this may be a high point for growth in 2025 amid ongoing global uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be gang members. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the wartime statute was not intended for use against criminal gangs like Tren de Aragua in peacetime. This decision blocks a key administration policy and reinforces judicial oversight over executive power in immigration matters. The ruling was praised by civil rights groups as a crucial check on presidential authority, though a dissenting judge argued it improperly interfered in foreign affairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and marines to Los Angeles was illegal, delivering a setback to his administration's efforts to use military forces for domestic law enforcement. The judge found that using soldiers for crowd control and to establish blockades violated a 19th-century law intended to prevent the military from acting as a national police force. The deployment was initiated in response to protests, with the administration describing the city as "invaded." This ruling could impact the president's stated ambitions to deploy troops in other U.S. cities facing unrest.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews, with air support, rapidly contained a quarter-acre brush fire that ignited in the steep terrain of the Hollywood Hills. The blaze, which started near Sunset Plaza Drive, moved uphill and briefly threatened several homes before its forward progress was halted within an hour. Water-dropping helicopters were crucial in slowing the fire, and approximately 80 firefighters worked to extinguish the flames, preventing any structural damage, although one car was burned. Residents were temporarily told to shelter in place as crews worked to cool hot spots, with the incident highlighting the elevated fire risk during the current heatwave.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill that would require K-12 schools and public colleges to issue emergency-style alerts to students, families, and staff if immigration enforcement agents are present on campus. The legislation, authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, aims to empower school communities to make informed safety decisions amid the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaigns. Proponents argue that the measure is necessary to maintain schools as safe learning environments for all students, including those from immigrant families. The bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature to become law, with an immediate effective date if signed.</p>

          <p>The global popularity of products like the Labubu doll from Pop Mart signals the beginning of a major branding supercycle for China, where trust in Chinese brands is rapidly growing. This article argues that this trend is expanding beyond consumer novelties into more industrial and technological sectors, such as electric vehicle batteries from CATL and cars from Xiaomi and BYD. Chinese companies are now competing on brand trust and recognition, not just cost advantages. This shift indicates a deeper change in China's business mindset, where components and industrial products are becoming globally recognized and sought-after brands. (not investment advice)</p>
