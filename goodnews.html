          <p>A social media post showing audience members wearing brain-reading devices at a university dance performance in China has gone viral, sparking both fascination and unease. The experiment, conducted during a dance drama called "Wing Chun" at Tsinghua University, involved eight students wearing electrode-covered hats to monitor their brain responses. While some commenters expressed horror and bewilderment, scientists explained that the brain-computer interface technology was intended to enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. The incident highlights the growing interest in and ethical concerns surrounding brain-computer interface technology in China. The technology is becoming more prevalent and as such, is more controversial in the public's eye.</p>

          <p>Japan's policy to make high school tuition free, even at private institutions, is causing concern among educators who fear it could lead to an exodus from public schools. Critics argue that the government has not provided adequate support for struggling public schools, which already face enrollment and budget challenges. While the policy aims to ease financial burdens for households, it risks undermining the role of public schools as safety nets for students with diverse needs. The policy's impact on the overall education system and the role of public schools is a subject of ongoing debate.</p>
