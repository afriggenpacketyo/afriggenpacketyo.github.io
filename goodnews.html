          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This positive result occurred despite challenges from a strong euro impacting its U.S. dollar-denominated business and mixed performance in its investment banking division. The bank's leadership expressed confidence in meeting full-year targets, citing strong business momentum and cost discipline, even as corporate loan growth remains sluggish amid market uncertainty.

          <p>China is aiming to strengthen its relationship with Nepal by advancing the trans-Himalayan connectivity network and increasing investment in key sectors like agriculture, new energy, and health. This initiative comes as Beijing competes with New Delhi for influence in the strategically located nation, which has traditionally been a close ally of India. In recent years, China has significantly increased its economic engagement with Nepal through substantial investments in infrastructure projects, from roads to hydropower plants, drawing the Himalayan country closer.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to sign a significant free trade agreement, concluding nearly three years of negotiations. The deal aims to cut tariffs on goods like British whisky and cars and Indian textiles, boosting bilateral trade, which totaled £42.6 billion last year. While hailed by both leaders as a major achievement that will create jobs and drive growth, the agreement must still be approved by the UK parliament before it can take effect.</p>

          <p>A semi-professional cyclist from Angus, Scotland, has accomplished the monumental feat of mountain biking down all 282 of the country's Munros, which are mountains over 3,000 feet. Sean Green, 36, is believed to be only the second person to complete this challenge, which took him over eight years. The quest required him to climb each summit while carrying his bike before cycling down the treacherous paths, a process that combined his love for the outdoors with extreme physical endurance and logistical challenges.</p>

The allowances, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, are intended for seniors assessed with moderate to severe disabilities to help cover costs for services like meal assistance and day care. This policy aims to alleviate the financial strain on families caring for an aging population, stimulate consumption in the elder-care sector, and strengthen the country's social safety net.

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the proposed policy is unconstitutional, as it contradicts the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place, preventing the administration from denying citizenship to children based on their parents' immigration status, and moves the contentious issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>
