          <p>The United States and Japan have established a significant trade deal, setting a new tariff rate of 15% on Japanese imports, including a reduction for automobiles from a potential 25%. As part of the agreement, President Trump announced that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American goods like trucks and agricultural products. The deal was celebrated by both nations, with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba highlighting its alignment with the national interests of both countries and noting it could bolster his political standing domestically. The announcement prompted a surge in Japanese markets, particularly for major auto manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to meet with officials from Israel and Qatar in Rome to push forward negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza. The talks are focused on a U.S.-backed proposal for a 60-day truce that would involve a phased release of hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of the region. President Trump has expressed optimism about the deal, urging Hamas to accept the terms, which he claims will not improve. A successful agreement could also pave the way for an expansion of the Abraham Accords, potentially normalizing relations between Israel and other neighboring countries.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Gene-Editing Technique to Make Mosquitoes Malaria-Resistant</h2>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria by making a single amino acid change in their genome using CRISPR gene-editing technology. The study, published in Nature, found that this small tweak effectively prevents the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the mosquito's salivary glands, a crucial step for transmission. Scientists believe this genetic modification could be spread through wild mosquito populations using a gene drive, potentially transforming them into a version that cannot transmit the deadly disease. While the technology is promising, it remains controversial due to potential unforeseen ecological consequences.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won the 17th stage of the Tour de France in a dramatic sprint finish in Valence. The Lidl-Trek rider navigated a chaotic final kilometer, which saw some of his main rivals involved in a crash, to claim his second victory of this year's tour. The win further strengthened his hold on the green jersey, awarded to the leader of the points classification. Meanwhile, overall race leader Tadej Pogacar finished safely within the main peloton, maintaining his significant lead in the general classification as the tour heads into its final challenging stages.</p>

          <p>England international and Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to the Spanish club Barcelona. The deal includes an option for a permanent transfer in 2026 and will see Barcelona cover the entirety of Rashford's wages. The move follows a difficult period for the 27-year-old at Old Trafford, where his form had declined and he faced disciplinary issues under multiple managers. This will be Rashford's first time playing outside the Premier League since emerging from United's academy and scoring 138 goals for the club.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler stated that his decision was based on the critical importance of his seat in maintaining the narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives. His announcement clarifies the potential field of GOP challengers to incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, a race that has drawn the attention of President Trump. Lawler's district is considered a key battleground that was won by both him and Vice President Kamala Harris in the last election cycle.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change. The decision is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying island states, who have long sought legal avenues to hold historically high-emitting countries accountable for climate-related damages. While the ruling is non-binding, it provides a powerful legal basis for future climate litigation and could pave the way for compensation claims for harm caused by global warming. The court also affirmed that all nations have a legal obligation to protect the climate system under international law.</p>

In return, Japan has agreed to open its economy to American imports such as trucks, rice, and other agricultural goods. Additionally, the deal includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. economy. This agreement is one of several country-specific deals brokered by the Trump administration as it pursues its "reciprocal tariffs" strategy with major trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Florida have made a potentially significant breakthrough in the development of a universal cancer vaccine. In a study on mice, an experimental mRNA vaccine, designed to broadly stimulate the immune system rather than target a specific cancer, was shown to greatly enhance the effectiveness of common immunotherapy drugs. The vaccine works by waking up the immune system to fight cancer as if it were a virus. If these findings can be replicated in humans, it could lead to an off-the-shelf vaccine that could be used across a wide range of cancer types.</p>
