          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that courts will support President Donald Trump's tariff agenda despite a recent legal setback. A federal court had struck down Trump's tariffs, but an appeals court issued a temporary stay to protect them during litigation. Hassett stated that the White House expects its "Plan A" to work out, emphasizing that the administration is prepared to pursue other alternatives if necessary. He defended the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, arguing that the President has the authority to address the national emergency caused by fentanyl deaths.

Robert Jenrick told the BBC that this measure would provide officers with "confidence" in handling threats, and secure armouries should be introduced at maximum security jails for use as a last resort. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) stated that some prison officers will trial Tasers this summer, but argued that giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) has called for stronger protection for staff after a series of attacks.</p>
