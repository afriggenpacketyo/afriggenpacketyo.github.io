          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney, marking Charles‚Äôs first visit since his coronation two years prior. The visit is viewed as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has repeatedly suggested Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Carney emphasized Canada's distinct heritage and sovereignty, a sentiment echoed by Canadians who see the monarchy as a symbol of their history separate from the United States. During the visit, King Charles will open Canada's Parliament and deliver the speech from the throne, asserting Canada's independent future. </p>

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the plight of sharks, marking the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws." Pugh aimed to change public perceptions of sharks, often vilified in popular culture, and promote their protection. Despite encountering frigid waters and challenging weather conditions, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, citing alarming statistics of their global decline. He hopes his swim will encourage a shift in how people view sharks and recognize their importance to a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Physicists Study the Sounds of Spaceflight to Understand Acoustic Impacts</h2>

          <p>Physicists are recording rocket launches and landings, particularly those by SpaceX, to understand the acoustics of spaceflight and their impact on communities. As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is increasingly affecting residents. Researchers are studying why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how topography influences sound wave propagation. The goal is to gather data that could help lessen disruptions before problems become pervasive, especially as SpaceX tests the larger and potentially louder Starship rocket.</p>

          <p>Physicists who record rocket launches and landings, most often by SpaceX, are learning important facts about the acoustics of spaceflight. Rocket launches are loud, and big rockets are louder. Launches used to be occasional spectacles, and not many people minded the noise. Dr. Gee and his team have also listened to the noises of other rockets, including the small Alpha rocket from Firefly Aerospace, the first launch of NASA‚Äôs giant Space Launch System rocket, the last flight of the Delta IV Heavy from United Launch Alliance and U.L.A.‚Äôs soon-to-be retired Atlas V.</p>
