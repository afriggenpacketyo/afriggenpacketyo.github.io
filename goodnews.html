          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods, marking a significant de-escalation in their trade tensions. This agreement, reached after high-stakes talks in Switzerland, involves cutting reciprocal tariffs from 125% to 10%, with the exception of U.S. duties on Chinese fentanyl imports, which will remain at 30%. The news has buoyed investors, with Nasdaq futures pointing to a 3.6% gain and the U.S. Dollar Index rising sharply, indicating a positive market response to the thawing trade relations. Both countries have committed to continuing discussions on economic and trade policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding, following a call from its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan, imprisoned since 1999, stated that the group's armed struggle had outlived its purpose and that progress could be achieved through politics. This decision is seen as a crucial step towards a "terror-free Turkey," although the specifics of Ocalan's potential parole and the extent of democratic reforms in Turkey to accommodate Kurdish rights remain uncertain. President Erdogan may seek support from pro-Kurdish political parties in the 2028 elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Royal experts suggest Kate Middleton's success within the monarchy stems from her adherence to royal rules and traditions, contrasting with Princess Diana's more rebellious approach. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age, Kate was more mature and deliberate in her approach to royal life, marrying Prince William at 29. This careful navigation, coupled with support from both the palace and her family, has allowed Kate to handle press scrutiny effectively and focus on her royal duties. Experts highlight William's supportive role and Kate's strong sense of self as key factors in her successful navigation of royal life.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to use executive powers to significantly cut prescription drug prices in the U.S., aiming for reductions between 30% and 80%. This initiative seeks to align U.S. drug prices with those in other countries, prompting a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks due to concerns about potential profit declines. Trump intends to introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the U.S. pays the lowest price globally. While he did not specify whether the order would apply to Medicare or other government health programs, the move signals a renewed effort to address high drug costs.</p>

Kenbishi uses traditional wooden equipment, such as dakidaru, and has even started making its own wooden equipment to ensure the taste remains unchanged.

          <h2>US-China Trade Talks Politically Symbolic, but Outcome is a Real 'Deal'?</h2>

          <p>Landmark China-US talks at the weekend likely carry economic and political significance on both sides while kick-starting a long process toward substantive deals that should address tariffs and other trade barriers, according to analysts. The apparent upbeat move in the Swiss city of Geneva stands to give both powers interim political relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war battlefront. Chinese and US negotiators agreed to establish a ‚Äútrade consultation mechanism‚Äù, while the White House released a statement describing the ‚ÄúChina trade deal‚Äù and cited Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äôs comment of ‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù.</p>

          <h2>India and Pakistan to Discuss Ceasefire After US-Brokered Agreement</h2>

          <p>Top military officials from India and Pakistan are scheduled to speak on Monday to discuss finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them over the weekend. The US-brokered ceasefire between the nuclear-armed neighbours appears to have held overnight after nearly four days of intense shelling and aerial incursions from both sides. India announced on Monday that it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns. Both countries have ceased hostilities since they announced the ceasefire but say they remain vigilant.</p>

          <h2>US Presidential Gifts and the Rules Governing Them</h2>

          <p>Reports that Donald Trump‚Äôs administration is preparing to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have set off a storm of criticism, as ethics experts say such a gift would violate rules within the constitution that seek to guard against bribery and corruption. There is a long history of US presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers. Clothes, antiques ‚Äì and even animals ‚Äì have all in the past been presented to US presidents. Most often these gifts are then disposed of through a complicated bureaucratic process enshrined in the constitution.</p>
