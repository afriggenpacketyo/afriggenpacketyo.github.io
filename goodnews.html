        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in the past year using a new artificial intelligence tool designed to combat fraud. A significant portion of this sum, £186 million, was related to fraudulent activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, including misuse of the Bounce Back Loan scheme. The new tool, called the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, will now be licensed to international partners like the US and Australia to help them make their policies "fraud-proof" before implementation. Concerns from civil liberties groups remain regarding the government's use of AI, citing past instances of bias in similar systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described a visit from a bipartisan US House of Representatives delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," emphasizing that the two nations should be partners, not rivals. This marks the first such visit in six years, and Wang urged Washington to value the current trend of stabilization in their relationship. He also reiterated China's position on Taiwan, asking the US to uphold its political commitments. The meeting is seen as a crucial step in reopening channels of communication and fostering a more objective understanding between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced that China will no longer seek "special and differential treatment" reserved for developing countries in future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. The move is framed as a gesture of support for multilateralism and free trade, aiming to position China as a responsible major power. Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Li also cautioned against decoupling, stating that such actions harm the global economy and international order. This decision addresses long-standing criticism that China has unfairly benefited from its developing nation status while being the world's second-largest economy.</p>

The airline requested a ground stop from the Federal Aviation Administration, which lasted for approximately 30 minutes. United stated that it experienced a "brief connectivity issue" but has since resumed normal operations. This marks the second time in less than two months that the airline has faced a significant disruption because of an unspecified technical glitch, following a similar incident in August that caused widespread delays.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares jumped over 6% after the company announced plans to significantly increase its investment in artificial intelligence. CEO Eddie Wu revealed that spending will exceed the previously announced 380 billion yuan initiative, focusing on developing AI models and infrastructure for the "artificial superintelligence" era. The company also unveiled its latest large language model, Qwen3-Max, and announced the expansion of its cloud data centers into Brazil, France, and the Netherlands. This strategic push positions Alibaba Cloud as a "full-stack AI service provider" and reflects a broader effort by Chinese tech firms to achieve self-sufficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI, in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, has unveiled plans for an unprecedented $850 billion infrastructure expansion to build a network of massive AI data centers. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged public concern over the staggering scale of the investment but insisted it is necessary to meet the tenfold increase in ChatGPT usage and the immense computational demands of advanced AI. The plan, which requires the electrical equivalent of 17 nuclear power plants, is facing skepticism about a potential bubble and a circular financing model among its partners. Altman stated that this buildout is essential to deliver the future of AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Returning to his late-night show after a suspension by ABC, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional monologue addressing the controversy over his remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of a young man's murder and expressed gratitude to those who defended his right to free speech, including some conservatives. The suspension was prompted by pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC, leading to a national debate on censorship. In his return, Kimmel criticized President Trump for celebrating Americans losing their jobs and reaffirmed the importance of free press.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The northern Chinese city of Datong successfully avoided disaster from heavy summer rains, a success credited to infrastructure work completed over 15 years ago by former mayor Geng Yanbo. The project, which involved widening the city's main river and reinforcing its banks, was controversial at the time due to resident relocations and the area's typically low rainfall. However, the investment proved crucial in managing nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges this year, preventing significant damage. Economists suggest that such long-term investments in urban resilience not only protect cities but can also serve as effective short-term economic stimuli.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has stated that an escalator carrying President Trump and the first lady stopped abruptly due to a built-in safety mechanism, not deliberate interference. A UN spokesperson suggested a videographer from the U.S. delegation, who was moving ahead of the couple, may have inadvertently triggered the safety feature at the top of the stairs. The explanation came after the White House press secretary suggested the incident could have been intentional and called for an investigation. President Trump later referenced the mishap in his speech as a metaphor for the UN's perceived incompetence.</p>
