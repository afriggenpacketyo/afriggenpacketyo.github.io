          <p>Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic believes the engineering firm could become the UK's most valuable company by leveraging its nuclear reactor technology to power AI-driven data centers. The company has signed deals to provide small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments, anticipating a global need for 400 SMRs by 2050, representing a trillion-dollar market. Despite SMRs being an unproven technology, Erginbilgic is confident in their potential and the company's unique nuclear capability. He also aims to expand Rolls-Royce's dominant aircraft engine business into the lucrative narrow-bodied aircraft market, asserting that these initiatives represent the single biggest opportunity for UK economic growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) encourages police forces in England and Wales to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations. This aims to combat misinformation and address significant public interest, particularly following cases where false information led to unrest. While the Home Office welcomes the move for transparency, critics, including a former Met Police Chief Superintendent, warn of unintended consequences, such as increased speculation when details are withheld. The guidance, which comes into immediate effect, reaffirms that verifying immigration status remains the Home Office's responsibility, not the police's.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 03:02:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major developers in Dubai are increasingly establishing in-house contracting firms, moving away from relying solely on third-party contractors, as the city's real estate market experiences a significant boom. This strategic shift aims to enhance control over construction timelines, costs, and quality, ultimately maximizing profits in a surging market where property prices have risen 70% in four years. Companies like Emaar Properties and Samana Developers have adopted this approach, with some now handling a majority of their projects internally due to difficulties attracting external bids. While offering greater certainty, this model also carries risks, such as potential idle capacity during market downturns.</p>

          <p>NPR explores new research into robot personalities, challenging the conventional programming of chatbots and AI to be consistently extraverted and cheerful. Science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce highlights a team experimenting with different robot temperaments, drawing inspiration from neurotic and anxious science fiction characters like C-3P0. This research aims to understand what makes a robot relatable to humans, suggesting that a broader range of personalities might foster more engaging and effective human-robot interactions. The initiative delves into the psychological aspects of AI, moving beyond purely functional design to explore emotional and social dimensions.</p>

          <p>Nine-time Grand Slam champion Monica Seles has publicly revealed her diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a rare neuromuscular autoimmune disease, three years ago. The 51-year-old tennis legend chose to disclose her long-term condition, which causes muscle weakness, to raise awareness ahead of the upcoming US Open. Seles first noticed symptoms, such as double vision, about five years ago and described the struggle to absorb and openly discuss the difficult disease. By sharing her story, the former world number one hopes to use her platform to educate others about myasthenia gravis, for which there is currently no cure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study, published in Nature Communications and conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and international universities, reveals that foreign-owned enterprises were responsible for 25% of all company emissions in China over a two-decade period. The research highlights that while eastern coastal regions reaped economic benefits, central and western inland areas bore heavier environmental burdens. This finding raises new questions regarding the scientific assessment of carbon emission responsibilities for multinational enterprises, underscoring their often-overlooked role in shaping global carbon inequality. The study emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of emission sources to address climate change effectively.</p>

          <p>China's "durian diplomacy" is expanding with the first direct air shipments of Cambodian durians arriving in Henan province, marking a new milestone in agricultural trade between the two nations. This initiative establishes a direct air corridor for fresh fruit, allowing for rapid cold chain transportation and ensuring the fruit's freshness upon arrival. Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct supply to the Chinese market, highlighting improved customs efficiency and growing trade relations. While the move signifies significant progress, some industry insiders remain cautious about the commercial competitiveness of Cambodian durians in the broader market.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion takeover bid for Google's Chrome internet browser, citing a commitment to user safety under independent operation. Perplexity stated it would maintain Google as the default search engine within Chrome, while allowing user adjustments, and continue supporting Chromium, the open-source platform. However, technology industry investors have dismissed the offer as a "stunt," significantly undervaluing Chrome and questioning whether the browser is even for sale. The bid comes amidst Google's ongoing antitrust scrutiny and Perplexity's recent launch of an AI-powered browser, Comet, as competition in the generative AI space intensifies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of suspended UCLA science research grants, totaling $584 million, ruling that the government's actions violated a previous injunction. The grants, covering critical areas like cancer and clean energy, were abruptly frozen by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Energy, citing alleged discrimination and failure to promote a research environment free of antisemitism at UCLA. The court found that the indefinite suspensions were effectively terminations, challenging the administration's attempt to coerce UCLA into a settlement. This ruling provides significant leverage for UCLA in resisting the administration's demands.</p>
