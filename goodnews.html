          <p>A US federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 1.1 million Venezuelan and Haitian migrants, declaring the action unlawful. District Judge Edward Chen's decision ensures these individuals can continue living and working legally in the United States, emphasizing the dangerous conditions in their home countries that make safe return impossible. The TPS program, established by Congress in 1990, grants temporary protections to migrants from nations experiencing severe instability, war, or natural disasters. The Department of Homeland Security, which has criticized the program as an exploited amnesty, has announced its intention to appeal this significant ruling, setting the stage for further legal battles over immigration policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China’s yuan has recently rallied, a phenomenon analysts largely attribute to stronger guidance from its central bank rather than purely market-driven forces, despite a mostly steady US dollar index. This period of strengthening is expected to remain measured, as Beijing aims to avoid harming the competitiveness of its exporters amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Even after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a September interest rate cut, the US dollar index showed no significant weakening, fluctuating within a narrow range. This indicates that China is actively managing its currency to balance domestic economic goals with the complexities of global trade and financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed an unprecedented compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could see his wealth exceed $1 trillion if the company achieves rigorous benchmarks over the next decade. The package, estimated at $900 billion, requires shareholder approval and hinges on Tesla reaching an $8.5 trillion market value and specific production goals, including one million Robotaxis and humanoid robots. This initiative aims to retain Musk and align his performance with Tesla's long-term financial success, following a previous $50 billion pay package being struck down by a Delaware judge due to negotiation irregularities.

          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit brought by authors, marking a significant development in the legal battles between creative industries and AI firms. The settlement, awaiting judicial approval, would compensate authors around $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. While a judge previously ruled that training AI models on legally obtained copyrighted works could be fair use, the use of pirated copies was deemed unlawful. This landmark agreement sets a precedent for AI companies to pay for the use of copyrighted material, signaling a shift towards a more compensated ecosystem for creators.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant offers crucial advice for potential winners on managing such a massive financial windfall. Winners face a choice between a lump sum payment, estimated at $826.4 million before taxes, or 30 graduated annual payments over 29 years. The accountant strongly advises taking the annuity option for most people due to the "dangerous" tendency to overspend with a lump sum, highlighting past lottery winners who ended up broke. Key initial steps include keeping the win quiet, signing the ticket, and consulting a team of financial professionals before making any decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chatbot builder Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to authors in a landmark copyright settlement that could redefine how artificial intelligence companies compensate creators.

While a judge ruled that training AI models on legally obtained copyrighted materials could be fair use, the unauthorized downloading of millions of books from pirate libraries was deemed improper.
