          <p>President Trump has lauded Nippon Steel as a valuable partner for U.S. Steel, endorsing the Japanese company's $14 billion investment into the American steel producer. This endorsement comes amid ongoing tariff negotiations between Japan and the U.S., with Japan seeking the removal of additional tariffs on its imports. Japan and Cambodia have also agreed to strengthen security cooperation, reflecting Japan's broader efforts to deepen ties with Asian countries amid China's growing influence. Japan's consumer affairs center is warning of rice scam websites as prices soar, and cheaper stockpiled rice is now available in stores. </p>
