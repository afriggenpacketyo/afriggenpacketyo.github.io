          <p>President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, following the administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at military academies. Recent changes include disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books on race and gender issues from libraries. Former West Point teachers have criticized these changes, arguing they hinder education and debate on controversial ideas. Trump's appearance also drew attention to his past criticisms of his Democratic opponents' health, recalling questions raised during his 2020 address at the school.</p>

          <p>Publix has recalled Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold in over 1,400 stores across eight states after testing revealed elevated lead levels. The potential contamination was identified by North Carolina officials, who previously detected a lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches in 2023. Routine sampling found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, exceeding the FDA's recommended limit. Customers are advised to return the product for a full refund, and no illnesses have been reported thus far. This incident marks the second baby food pouch recall in two months due to potential lead contamination.</p>

The owners had invited Hudson to play golf, and that she had replied that she preferred a "men's senior shaft." Belichick and Hudson's relationship was confirmed, and reports have said they began dating in early 2022.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing calls for police reform under Chief Brian O'Hara, who aims to improve community trust and safety. While shootings have decreased, violent crime remains a challenge due to officer shortages. O'Hara is focused on "getting back to the basics" and changing the department's culture, adjusting arrest tactics, and enhancing community engagement. Despite the Justice Department ending investigations and proposed consent decrees, reform efforts will continue. Residents have noted positive changes in police behavior and interactions with the community.</p>

          <p>A significant power outage impacted the Cannes region in France, affecting 160,000 homes and disrupting the Cannes Film Festival. The outage was attributed to a fire at a substation and vandalism of an electricity pylon, leading officials to suspect a criminal act. Power was gradually restored, and the Cannes Film Festival organizers ensured that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned using an alternative power supply. The incident caused traffic disruptions and shop closures, but festival events were largely unaffected.</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in Texas shows signs of slowing, but health officials are cautioning against complacency as other states experience a rise in cases. Despite declining infections in Lubbock and El Paso, Texas, new cases have been reported in New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The US has surpassed 1,000 confirmed measles cases, making 2025 the second-worst year since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000. Officials emphasize the importance of vaccination campaigns to achieve community immunity, especially given misinformation spread by public figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the 2025 graduating class at West Point, marking his first military commencement address of his second term. The address follows the second Trump administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military. West Point has since disbanded cadet clubs focused on race and gender. The address also comes after Vice President J.D. Vance emphasized a shift in foreign policy against open-ended conflicts at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US have significantly decreased after a pandemic-era spike, with murder rates falling to pre-pandemic levels. The FBI's 2023 crime report shows a nearly 12 percent decrease in murder year over year, and early numbers for 2025 suggest a continued decline. Analysts attribute the drop to the easing of pandemic-related stressors and government initiatives aimed at reducing violence. Despite these positive trends, public perception often lags behind reality, with many Americans still believing that crime is on the rise.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House pushed through President Trump's agenda, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," using procedural tactics similar to those they criticized Democrats for employing during the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The final text of the bill was released shortly before the vote, and rules were waived to expedite the process. Despite some internal dissent, the bill passed along party lines, highlighting the GOP's commitment to advancing Trump's priorities. This approach reflects a pattern of Republicans mirroring and exceeding past actions of Democrats.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control. This move has garnered support from some investors, including Bill Ackman, who sees it as a positive step for taxpayers. However, critics warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and increase costs for homebuyers. The decision remains uncertain, and any actions will be carefully evaluated to ensure the stability of the housing market.</p>
