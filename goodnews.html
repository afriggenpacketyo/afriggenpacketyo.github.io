This public display of their enduring bond comes as the couple celebrates their 26th wedding anniversary, signaling the strength of their personal relationship even as broader family challenges remain a point of public interest and speculation.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, bowling alleys, and expanded bookstores. This strategy aims to transform malls into community hubs, driving what is known as "cross-shopping" and increasing foot traffic from diverse demographics, including Gen Z. Landlords are subdividing large retail spaces for a mix of entertainment, dining, and service-oriented businesses, a trend that data suggests is successfully revitalizing once-declining enclosed malls across the country.</p>

          <p>A high school football player who suffered from debilitating headaches and dizziness for months following a concussion was ultimately diagnosed with a rare brain condition. After physical therapy and medications failed to alleviate his symptoms, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels. The AVM, likely the true cause of his long-term symptoms, was successfully removed via surgery. The family is now advocating for earlier diagnostic imaging for persistent post-concussion issues.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that many Americans, particularly Gen Z and millennials, are turning to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services to afford tickets for expensive concerts. This trend, driven by "funflation," reflects the high cost of live events from major artists. While BNPL offers a way to spread out payments, financial analysts advise caution, suggesting consumers instead create dedicated savings funds for entertainment. The article also compares the consumer protections of BNPL plans versus traditional credit cards, noting that credit cards often provide better recourse if an event is canceled.

In the early 1990s, Grimes postponed her retirement plans to investigate why numerous CIA informants in the Soviet Union were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs directly linked fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames to espionage, revealing he had accepted millions from the Soviets. Ames's capture in 1994 was a direct result of her team's crucial counterintelligence work.</p>

          <h2>Startup Proposes Manufacturing Gold as a Byproduct of Nuclear Fusion to Offset Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: producing gold by altering atoms during the nuclear fusion process. The idea is not to get rich, but to generate a valuable byproduct that could subsidize the immense cost of developing commercial fusion energy, a clean and near-limitless power source. While theoretically possible and intriguing to physicists, the concept is entirely speculative, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist. The proposal revives a centuries-old dream, but this time it is grounded in nuclear physics rather than mystical pursuits.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by spinning off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, undervaluing it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink, while overlooking the highly profitable and rapidly growing DAT segment. The firm's analysis suggests that separating the businesses could lead to a significant increase in Viasat's total valuation, as the defense unit would be assessed against higher-multiple aerospace and defense peers.

The U.S.-brokered deal will reopen key transportation routes, including a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be named the "Trump Route." The agreement marks a significant geopolitical development, potentially reducing Russia's long-standing influence in the South Caucasus.

          <p>OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, has been met with mixed reviews from Chinese technology experts and the public, with some describing it as an incremental update rather than a revolutionary breakthrough. While OpenAI touted the new model as its smartest and fastest yet, some Chinese commentators noted it lacked memorable new features. The lukewarm reception comes as China's own tech giants are rapidly developing their own advanced AI models, intensifying the global competition for AI dominance. The article highlights the increasingly competitive and sophisticated landscape of artificial intelligence development.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) route connecting the two autonomous regions. A new company has been established to oversee the project, which will link the existing line in Tibet with a new line from Hotan in Xinjiang. This railway is a key part of China's broader plan to create a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035.

          <p>Unexpectedly high cell phone bills from international travel can be a frustrating expense, but there are several ways to mitigate costs. Experts recommend strategies such as switching to a carrier that includes some international roaming or purchasing a local or international eSIM for cheaper data access. For those wanting to avoid charges altogether, using free Wi-Fi networks is key. This can be made more effective by pre-downloading offline maps and guidebooks before leaving, ensuring you can navigate and access information without needing a cellular connection.</p>

According to NASA, a bright full moon will coincide with the peak, its light likely washing out the view of all but the brightest meteors. The Perseids originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet and are known for their bright fireballs. While viewing conditions are not ideal, skygazers in the Northern Hemisphere might still catch a few meteors in the predawn hours.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops taking down some of the propaganda loudspeakers positioned along the shared border. This move is seen as a reciprocal gesture after South Korea's new administration, under President Lee Jae Myung, halted its own broadcasts in a bid to ease tensions and reopen dialogue. The loudspeakers have been a tool of psychological warfare for both sides for years, with the South playing K-pop and news and the North emitting unsettling noises. The dismantling represents a tangible step toward de-escalation on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 22-year-old Slovenian striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. The five-year contract makes Sesko the club's third major attacking signing of the season, as new manager Ruben Amorim overhauls the team. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, is a highly-rated young talent known for his pace, physical presence, and goal-scoring record in the Bundesliga. His arrival raises questions about the future of current striker Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford.</p>
