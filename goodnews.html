          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With patents for popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic expiring in China soon, dozens of local pharmaceutical companies are developing generic alternatives. Analysts predict this will lead to a significant drop in prices, making treatments for obesity and diabetes more accessible to a wider population. Currently, around 60 similar drugs are in clinical trials, positioning Chinese firms to compete in a global market valued at over $150 billion. The influx of generic versions is expected to intensify market competition and drive down costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement attributed to rising international tariffs. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, aims to increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% to accommodate larger vessels. Officials acknowledge the current uncertainty in global trade but express confidence in the long-term necessity of the infrastructure investment. The expansion is expected to strengthen the supply chain and create new jobs in the region.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to multiple charges including drug trafficking and running a continuing criminal enterprise.

As part of his plea agreement, he has pledged to cooperate fully with authorities in exchange for a potentially reduced sentence and will forfeit $80 million in assets.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting what immigrant rights advocates describe as unlawful and indiscriminate immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California. The ruling found sufficient evidence that federal agents were stopping individuals based on factors like race, language, or location, which does not meet the 4th Amendment's requirement for reasonable suspicion. The order prohibits agents from using these factors for detention and mandates that detainees at a specific facility be given 24-hour access to legal counsel.</p>

          <p>The song 'The Night We Met' by indie band Lord Huron, originally released in 2015, has become a massive sleeper hit, accumulating over three billion streams on Spotify. Its popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series '13 Reasons Why' and has been sustained by its widespread use on TikTok. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship. The track's slow-burning success is a rare phenomenon for a song that was not a commercial hit upon its initial release.</p>

          <p>King Charles recently hosted his inaugural 'Harmony Summit' at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of traditional, sustainable practices. The King's long-held belief system, which was once considered an outlier, advocates for working with nature rather than against it. The summit aimed to draw on the wisdom of Indigenous peoples as guardians of the natural world.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. While Swiatek holds the advantage in big-match experience, she has historically been less comfortable on grass courts. Anisimova, playing in her first Wimbledon final, has shown formidable power but also signs of nervousness in previous rounds. Analysts suggest the outcome will depend on which player better manages the pressure of the occasion, with Anisimova's underdog status potentially allowing her to play more freely against the world number one.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is championing a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, navigating the growing tensions between the United States and China. In a recent speech, he invoked the legacy of wartime leader John Curtin, emphasizing the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interests rather than being bound by tradition. While maintaining the AUKUS security pact and the U.S. alliance, Albanese's 'Australia first' approach signals a recalibration of relationships with both allies and rivals, asserting the nation's independence in an uncertain global landscape.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with non-speaking autism, has been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after his father discovered he could communicate by typing with his thumb. For 14 years, Viraj was believed to be severely mentally disabled, as a neurological disorder prevented him from speaking or controlling his fingers. Once able to communicate via an iPad, his advanced intelligence was revealed, and he progressed from basic math to calculus in under three years. Viraj hopes his story will inspire recognition for the hidden abilities of others in the non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleges the company uses manipulative and addictive design features that harm children and teens. The state's lawsuit claims TikTok is intentionally designed to exploit its young user base for longer engagement, increasing their exposure to ads and e-commerce. The judge ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, marking an important step in efforts to hold the social media giant accountable for practices that allegedly put children at risk. TikTok has refuted the claims as outdated.</p>
