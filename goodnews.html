          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the significant differences between American and European food regulations, highlighting that many additives like Red Dye 40, common in U.S. products, are banned or restricted in Europe. While these substances are a concern, the piece argues that the larger health crisis in the U.S. stems from excessive consumption of sugar, saturated fats, and ultra-processed foods in general. It calls for a comprehensive shift toward whole foods and better dietary habits, suggesting that regulatory changes alone are insufficient to address America's lagging life expectancy compared to its European peers.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, marking his first month in office, has pledged to swiftly improve diplomatic ties with both China and Russia as a priority for his government. Emphasizing a pragmatic approach focused on national stability and peace, Lee stated his belief in a "virtuous cycle of peace" that involves maintaining a strong alliance with the U.S. while also fostering better relationships with Beijing and Moscow. This diplomatic initiative is already underway, with reports that China has invited President Lee to attend a significant military parade in Beijing in September.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the declining allure of the American road trip, once a symbol of discovery and freedom, but now often characterized by digital detachment and corporate sameness. The author, who teaches a course on the topic, describes a personal cross-country journey where faith in the experience was nearly lost amidst ecological despair and a cynical view of meeting fellow Americans. However, a stop at a small motel in Shamrock, Texas, run by a warm South Asian family, restored a sense of connection and hope, reminding him that the road's true value lies in the unexpected, shared human moments that transcend political division.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of VTubers, performers who use animated avatars and motion-capture technology, is expanding from online platforms to mainstream venues like Dodger Stadium and Hollywood concert halls. These creators, deeply rooted in anime culture, offer a unique blend of fantasy and personal connection that has attracted billions of views on YouTube. Companies like Hololive are leading this push, aiming to broaden the appeal of their virtual talents beyond their core fanbase. For performers, VTubing provides a sense of anonymity and creative freedom, allowing them to connect with audiences without the pressures of on-camera appearances.</p>

          <p>A new music subgenre, dubbed "toddler techno," is gaining popularity by blending classic children's songs with electronic dance beats, creating an experience enjoyable for both kids and their millennial parents. Australian DJ Lenny Pearce, a former boy band member, is at the forefront of this trend, hosting sold-out "baby raves" across the U.S. where families can dance together. While some critics question the appropriateness of rave culture for children, proponents and some experts note that these daytime events can promote joy and parent-child bonding. The events are carefully managed to be kid-friendly, with controlled sound levels and sensory support.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, the frontman of Creedence Clearwater Revival, reflects on the creation of some of the band's most iconic songs, including "Proud Mary," "Lodi," and "Fortunate Son." He reveals that "Proud Mary" came to him in a moment of euphoria after his discharge from the army, while the anti-war anthem "Fortunate Son" was fueled by observations of class privilege during the Vietnam War. Fogerty also discusses his decades-long legal battle over his song rights, which prevented him from performing his hits for years. Now, having regained control of his publishing, he is rerecording the band's catalog.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the policy platform of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, arguing that his proposals are less radical than critics claim. Policies such as a temporary rent freeze, publicly owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been tested in other cities and contexts with some success. For example, the Rent Guidelines Board has frozen rents before, and several states operate publicly owned liquor stores. The piece suggests Mamdani's agenda is fundamentally about making government more effective and responsive to residents' needs, which proved to be a politically successful message in the primary.</p>

As the second carrier in the People's Liberation Army Navy, the Shandong represents a significant step in China's military modernization and its ambition to project power beyond its immediate coastal waters. With a full-load displacement of 70,000 tonnes, the vessel is a key instrument for extending China's influence across the strategic island chains in the Western Pacific.

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has received a call-up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, replacing Elliot Daly, who suffered a fractured arm. The decision is notable as Farrell has not played international rugby for nearly two years, having taken a break after the 2023 World Cup, and has been sidelined by a concussion for nine weeks. Despite the controversy surrounding his selection over other match-ready players, Lions coach Andy Farrell, his father, stated that Owen's experience and leadership will be valuable additions to the squad for his fourth tour.</p>

          <p>British financial markets showed signs of recovery after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly supported Chancellor Rachel Reeves, whose emotional display in parliament had triggered market turmoil. On Wednesday, UK bond yields spiked and the pound fell amid speculation that Reeves might resign over pressure from her own party regarding spending plans. Starmer's assurance that he and the chancellor were "in lockstep" helped calm investors' nerves, though analysts warn that the government's limited fiscal flexibility and political infighting could lead to continued volatility as it faces difficult budget decisions.

          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell on Thursday, partially reversing a sharp spike from the previous day caused by Chancellor Rachel Reeves's emotional appearance in parliament. The yield on 10-year government bonds decreased after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly affirmed his support for Reeves, easing market fears that her potential departure would weaken fiscal discipline. Analysts suggest the market's reaction indicates support for the chancellor's strict fiscal rules, fearing that her replacement might lead to larger deficits. The stability of these borrowing costs is important as they can influence consumer mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors on people without diabetes has identified a common pattern called a "dip," where blood sugar plummets below baseline levels a few hours after eating carbs. Scientists at King's College London found these dips are linked to increased hunger, fatigue, and lower alertness, potentially leading to overeating and making weight loss more difficult. To prevent these crashes, nutritionists recommend "dressing your carbs" by pairing them with protein, fat, and fiber. They also suggest eating protein and fiber first during a meal and spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day.</p>
