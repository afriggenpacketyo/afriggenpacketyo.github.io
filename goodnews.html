          <p>GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy are being considered for microdosing, with some doctors, including Dr. Terry Dubrow, suggesting low daily doses for general health beyond diabetes and weight loss. Proponents highlight benefits like blood sugar regulation and reduced heart disease risk, while acknowledging ongoing research and unknowns. However, drug manufacturers explicitly warn against off-label microdosing due to potential safety risks and lack of data. This article explores the growing trend and the differing views on its widespread adoption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume in the United States saw a significant 9.2% increase last week, reaching its highest level in three years. This surge was primarily driven by a sharp drop in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate, which decreased to 6.49% from 6.64%, marking the lowest rate since October 2024. Both purchase and refinance applications rose, indicating renewed borrower confidence and activity in the housing market. Economists attribute the rate decline to data suggesting a weakening labor market.</p>

          <p>The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled against social media advertisements from Strongbow and Jägermeister, deeming them irresponsible for implying alcohol is crucial for social success or takes priority in life. Strongbow's ad, a Spider-Man parody, was criticized for suggesting alcohol was more important than personal responsibilities. Jägermeister's ads were found to portray alcohol as the defining factor of a successful social event. Both brands have accepted the ASA's judgments and withdrawn the offending posts, highlighting regulatory scrutiny over alcohol marketing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction, blocking President Donald Trump from removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a decision that upholds the central bank's independence. The judge ruled that Trump's attempt to fire Cook, citing mortgage fraud allegations from before her tenure, likely violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, which limits removals to behavior in office. This unprecedented legal battle, expected to reach the Supreme Court, ensures Cook's participation in upcoming Fed meetings, where interest rate cuts are anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is now home to the first onshore wave power project in the United States, launched by Swedish company Eco Wave Power. The pilot project uses bobbing steel floaters to harness ocean energy, generating 100 kilowatts of clean electricity, enough for about 100 homes. This innovative technology keeps expensive components on land, avoiding marine disruption and offering 24/7 power, unlike some other renewables. The project aims to scale up to 60 megawatts, contributing to ambitious climate goals and port decarbonization efforts.</p>
