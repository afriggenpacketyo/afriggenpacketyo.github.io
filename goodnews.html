          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surpassed 45,000 for the first time, leading a rally in Asian-Pacific markets. The surge followed comments from U.S. President Donald Trump indicating positive progress in trade negotiations with China. This optimism was somewhat tempered by a separate "framework" deal concerning the divestment of TikTok, with final terms to be discussed between the leaders. Other regional markets, such as South Korea's Kospi, also saw significant gains, while U.S. markets closed higher in anticipation of a Federal Reserve meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German authorities carried out raids on thirteen properties in the states of Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and North Rhine-Westphalia, targeting a group of suspected far-right extremists. The suspects, aged between 32 and 57, were believed to be in possession of illegal weapons. This operation is part of a broader crackdown on right-wing radicalism in Germany, following several major raids in recent months. Separately, the article notes that a 26-year-old Afghan man was sentenced to life in prison for the fatal stabbing of a police officer in Mannheim in 2024.</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the "triple lock" system, the pension increases annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. This adjustment would increase the new flat-rate state pension to over £12,500 a year. However, concerns are being raised that the rising pension is approaching the frozen personal tax allowance threshold of £12,570, potentially pulling more retirees into paying income tax.

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill that will create a legal "duty of candour" for public officials and bodies involved in investigations into major disasters. This legislation, long championed by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster, aims to end a culture of cover-ups by imposing criminal sanctions for dishonesty. The bill will also provide legal funding for those affected by state-related disasters. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law will change "the balance of power in Britain" and apply to future scandals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are implementing advanced methods to track players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" of health and a key factor in athletic performance. Teams like England's Red Roses and the USA Eagles use daily wellness forms and dedicated apps to monitor cycle phases. This data allows medical staff to make informed adjustments to training intensity, nutrition, and recovery protocols to mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps. The approach aims to maximize player potential and health in a physically demanding sport, moving away from a one-size-fits-all training model historically based on male athletes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the controversial proposal to eliminate the "not proven" verdict from its unique three-verdict legal system. Critics argue the verdict is confusing and fails to provide closure for victims, while some defense lawyers believe it offers an additional safeguard for the accused. To balance its removal, the bill also proposes raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. The legislation is part of a broader package aimed at improving the justice system for victims and witnesses.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for accelerated efforts to build a unified national market, identifying it as a critical strategy for gaining an advantage in global competition. In a recently published speech, Xi outlined key tasks, including curbing excessive and destructive price competition among domestic firms. He urged industry associations to guide companies toward prioritizing product quality over simply offering the lowest price. This directive aligns with broader government goals to phase out obsolete industrial capacity and enhance the overall efficiency and strength of China's internal economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the U.S. operations of TikTok, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The announcement, made during trade talks in Madrid, suggests a path toward American ownership that could avert a national ban on the popular social media app. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to finalize the terms on Friday. The ownership of TikTok has been a major national security concern for Washington and a significant point of contention in the broader trade negotiations between the two economic superpowers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers plan to utilize Shohei Ohtani primarily as a starting pitcher in the upcoming playoffs, but the team has not ruled out using him in a relief role in high-leverage situations. Andrew Friedman, the team's president of baseball operations, acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could lead to Ohtani being deployed from the bullpen, similar to how other starters have been used in past postseasons. However, MLB's two-way player rules present a complication, as using Ohtani as a reliever would mean the team loses his designated hitter spot once he leaves the mound.</p>
