          <p>Singapore's Formula One Grand Prix is proving to be a major economic catalyst, significantly boosting tourism not only for the island nation but also for the broader Asia-Pacific region. Analysis of flight bookings reveals that many international attendees, including a quarter of Americans and Canadians, are extending their travels to nearby countries like Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia, particularly Bali. This trend, supported by travel websites bundling race packages with regional excursions, transforms the F1 event into a regional tourism driver. The Grand Prix has also expanded into a week-long affair, drawing global business leaders to trade forums and attracting more leisure travelers and families, underscoring a growing consumer preference for unique travel experiences.</p>

          <p>Don Rea Jr., President of the PGA of America, has issued a formal apology for the "disrespectful" and "inappropriate" fan abuse directed at European players during the recent Ryder Cup. This comes after his initial comments downplaying the severity of the incidents drew criticism. European team members reported experiencing vitriolic taunts, homophobic slurs, and even a beer being thrown at Rory McIlroy's wife. Rea's apology, which follows a similar statement from PGA of America CEO Derek Sprague, acknowledges that some fan behavior "clearly crossed the line" and was not representative of the organization's values. The incident highlights ongoing challenges with sportsmanship and crowd control at major sporting events.</p>

          <p>USA Rare Earth shares surged after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company's "close communication" with the White House, signaling potential government collaboration to strengthen the domestic rare earth supply chain. This follows recent Trump administration investments, including equity stakes in Lithium Americas and MP Materials, designed to reduce U.S. dependence on China for critical minerals. Humpton highlighted the necessity of diverse industry players to build out this strategic market and supported the administration's focus on American manufacturing. USA Rare Earth is actively developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, positioning itself as a key contributor to national supply chain resilience.

          <p>Chinese investors are experiencing a significant boon from the global surge in gold prices, with their gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) holdings now valued at US$21 billion. Financial institutions like Julius Baer and Lombard Odier forecast continued growth, predicting gold could reach $3,900-$4,000 per ounce within the next year. This rally is attributed to gold's role as a reliable diversifier and hedge against escalating political and economic risks, coupled with a weakening U.S. dollar. The 13 gold ETFs listed on Chinese exchanges have delivered a 42% return this year, mirroring spot gold's performance. Additionally, robust demand from central banks globally, seeking to diversify foreign reserves, is further propelling the metal's ascent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Detroit Tigers advanced to the American League Division Series (ALDS) by defeating the Cleveland Guardians 6-3, securing their second consecutive Wild Card Series victory on the road. Key plays included Dillon Dingler's go-ahead home run in the sixth inning and Wenceel Pérez's two-run single during a decisive four-run seventh. The Tigers, despite a poor September record, demonstrated resilience to overcome the AL Central champion Guardians, who had mounted a historic division comeback but ultimately ran out of steam. Detroit will now face the Seattle Mariners, the AL West champions, in Game 1 of the Division Series on Saturday, setting up an anticipated matchup between the two teams.</p>

          <h2>New Report Advocates for "Planetary Health Diet" to Improve Health and Combat Climate Change</h2>

          <p>A significant update from the EAT-Lancet Commission highlights that adopting a "planetary health diet"—emphasizing varied nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, while reducing meat and dairy—is essential for improving global health and combating climate change. This dietary shift could prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually and slash food system greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. Despite the scientific consensus, the report is anticipated to face organized misinformation campaigns, often linked to the meat and dairy industry, which leverage social media and AI to promote meat-centric diets and discredit health and sustainability research. The commission aims to counter this by presenting the diet as both delicious and aspirational, rather than a form of deprivation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has begun issuing redesigned driver's licenses and identification cards that incorporate enhanced security features, notably a first-in-the-nation digital signature. The new aesthetic replaces previous state-specific imagery with depictions of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline. Importantly, current licenses remain valid until their expiration, eliminating any urgent need for immediate replacement. These updated cards also eliminate the magnetic strip and integrate "next-generation technology" to bolster anti-counterfeit measures, reflecting the state's ongoing commitment to improving document security. This redesign builds upon earlier security upgrades, such as the 2018 implementation of REAL ID, which enhanced identity verification for domestic air travel and federal building access.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs in the United States to match prices in other developed countries, a significant win for President Trump after years of failed attempts to curb drug prices. Pfizer also committed to participating in TrumpRx, a new website offering discounted drugs directly to consumers. This concession, reportedly surprising even industry lobbyists, was secured after Trump threatened 100% tariffs on drug companies not manufacturing products in the U.S., offering a three-year exemption as incentive. While the immediate financial impact on patients remains unclear, this deal marks a shift in the pharmaceutical industry's united front against price regulation, potentially emboldening Trump to pursue similar agreements with other major drugmakers.

          <p>This article delves into the controversial and evolving history of college rankings in America, beginning with Edwin Embree's informal 1934 list that ignited widespread debate and consumer interest. Earlier efforts, such as Kendric Babcock's 1911 classification, faced strong backlash and government suppression, underscoring the inherent sensitivities surrounding such evaluations. Despite initial challenges, the concept gained traction, culminating in U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings in the 1980s, which transformed into a cultural touchstone amid the rise of higher education as a mass-consumer good. The article posits that while ranking methodologies have become more sophisticated, they continue to profoundly influence public perception, institutional strategies, and even attempts by colleges to manipulate their metrics.</p>

The discovery is highly significant, not just for its monetary value, but also for its profound historical importance, as visible dates and mint marks provide invaluable data for historians and collectors. This extraordinary find offers a tangible connection to the golden age of the Spanish Empire and the rich maritime history of the region.</p>
