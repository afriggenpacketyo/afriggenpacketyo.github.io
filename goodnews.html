          <p>A livestock lorry overturned on the M1 motorway, prompting a rescue operation involving the fire service and animal rescue teams. Forty cattle were involved in the incident, with most cows successfully rescued, while a small number had to be euthanized due to their injuries. The driver of the lorry is reported to be safe and well. The incident has led to the closure of the motorway between junctions 11 and 12 in both directions, with no estimated time for reopening. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced that CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen will step down as the company navigates increasing competition in the obesity drug market. The decision comes after the company's stock price declined significantly over the past year due to disappointing trial results and growing competition. While J√∏rgensen will remain in his role to support the transition, the board has begun searching for a successor. This change in leadership follows lower-than-expected first-quarter sales of Wegovy and a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast, indicating challenges in maintaining market dominance. </p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of a broader tax bill. This "bonus" aims to provide tax relief to seniors, offering an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, an idea previously touted by President Trump. The deduction would be available to those 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes over $150,000. While the deduction would reduce taxable income, it is less generous than a tax credit. </p>

Despite backing Trump's agenda, including a smaller federal government, residents are worried about the impact of layoffs and reductions to essential services like healthcare and emergency preparedness. While support for Trump remains strong among Republicans, the unease highlights the potential harm to rural communities that rely on federal support. The situation underscores the challenges of balancing fiscal conservatism with the needs of communities dependent on government assistance. </p>

Despite the challenges, Galaxy Digital is now trading on U.S. public markets, with Novogratz ringing the opening bell at the Nasdaq.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle is currently infeasible due to the complexities of the global automotive supply chain, according to industry experts. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase domestic sourcing through tariffs, the cost of reshoring all auto parts manufacturing would be substantial. Many parts are cheaper to produce overseas, and establishing new processing and production plants in the U.S. would take a decade or more. Ford CEO Jim Farley notes that sourcing 15% to 20% of commoditized parts domestically is currently difficult or impossible, and a 100% U.S.-made vehicle could price many consumers out of the market. </p>

However, the article also points out that short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve.
