          <p>The UK's job market is showing signs of weakening, with a decrease in the number of workers on payrolls during the first quarter of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Job vacancies have also declined, indicating a cooling demand for labor. While wage growth has slowed, pay is still increasing at a rate faster than inflation, offering some relief to workers amidst the rising cost of living. These trends suggest a potential shift in the UK's economic landscape, requiring careful monitoring and policy adjustments to support employment and economic stability.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. and China agreeing to lower tariff rates, the triple-digit duties imposed since April have been significantly reduced.

However, these rates do not include previous tariffs, held over from the first iteration of the trade war, nor do they factor in other duties on specific goods. The baseline rate is about 50 per cent, according to estimates, with the around 20 per cent in tariffs imposed during Trump‚Äôs first term, plus the 30 per cent in new duties still in force.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, initially hit by interest rate hikes in 2022, saw profits rise as higher rates boosted net interest income. Now, as interest rates decline, fintechs, especially digital banks, face a critical test regarding the sustainability of this income. Falling rates may expose vulnerabilities in some fintechs, while others with broader income strategies may prove more adaptable. Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce reliance on card fees and interest, such as Revolut's addition of crypto and share trading, and Bunq's focus on subscription and card-based fees.</p>
