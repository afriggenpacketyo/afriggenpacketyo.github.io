          <h2>Political Economist Discusses China's Path from 'Polycrisis' to 'Polytunity'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 18:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang, an expert on China's political economy, discusses the nation's current challenges, which she terms a 'polycrisis.' In an interview, she reflects on the historical efforts by pioneers of U.S.-China relations to foster deep understanding between the two nations. Ang suggests that this historical context is crucial for navigating the present, arguing that China has the potential to transform its complex set of crises into a 'polytunity,' or an opportunity for adaptive growth. She emphasizes the decline in American expertise on China and the need to rebuild that intellectual bridge for stable international relations.</p>

          <p>The latest Marvel film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has opened with a strong box office performance, earning an estimated $118 million in North America and $218 million globally. This debut marks the fourth-largest opening of the year and the biggest for a Marvel film since "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film's success, alongside that of DC's recent "Superman" movie, is seen by media analysts as a sign that superhero fatigue is not a major issue, suggesting audiences still respond to well-made films in the genre. The movie, set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, introduces a new cast for the iconic superhero family.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU has reportedly committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the U.S. European leaders expressed relief, with Germany's chancellor noting the benefit to its auto industry, though some voiced caution about the impact of the new tariffs.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already implementing smart infrastructure and climate innovations, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. The author suggests creating a low-carbon travel corridor connecting the region's cities, capitalizing on the area's advanced green technology. To succeed, this shift requires not just hardware but also coordinated policies and partnerships that cater to the evolving priorities of environmentally conscious travelers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, with discussions expected to focus on transatlantic trade and the conflict in Gaza. The meeting follows the recent announcement of a U.S.-EU trade deal, and Starmer is likely to press for favorable terms for the UK, particularly on steel tariffs. The Prime Minister faces a diplomatic challenge, balancing the UK's close alliance with the U.S. against differing approaches on Gaza among European allies like France, which recently announced it would recognize a Palestinian state. The talks will require Starmer to navigate these sensitive foreign policy issues carefully.</p>

          <p>The newly announced trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is being framed as a victory for both President Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen. The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on many EU goods, avoids the threatened 30% rate, offering relief to Europe, while securing significant investment and tariff revenue for the U.S. This analysis suggests the deal's success relied on direct involvement from the leaders, a pattern in Trump's negotiations. However, key details regarding the timeline and specifics of the EU's investment commitments remain unclear, indicating the true impact is yet to be fully determined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Divya Tyagi, an undergraduate engineering student at Penn State, has successfully solved a 100-year-old aerodynamic problem, creating a new model that could significantly enhance wind turbine design. Her work refines a 1935 theory by Hermann Glauert, accounting for real-world forces like wind pressure and blade bending that the original model overlooked. Tyagi's solution provides more precise calculations for optimizing turbine performance and durability, which could lead to more efficient and longer-lasting designs. Her adviser noted that even a 1% improvement in a large turbine's power coefficient could have a major impact on energy production.</p>

          <p>While the absence of a major panel from Marvel Studios was a prominent topic ahead of this year's San Diego Comic-Con, many attendees found the situation had its benefits. The lack of a blockbuster Marvel presentation in the famed Hall H meant shorter lines and easier access to other panels, such as those for "Alien: Earth" and "The Long Walk." Fans noted that while different, the convention still had a strong Marvel presence through other promotions and that the event's appeal extends beyond a single studio. The shift highlighted the growing influence of television, anime, and independent creators at the pop culture gathering.</p>
