        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey by Shibuya Ward and the nonprofit Nijiiro Diversity reveals that a same-sex partnership system, first introduced in 2015, is now available to 92.5% of Japan's population. As of May 2025, 530 local governments have adopted the system, with 9,836 couples registered. However, Japan remains the only G7 nation without legalized same-sex marriage, and these partnership certificates are not legally binding, denying couples rights like medical decision-making and tax benefits. Activists continue to advocate for full marriage equality, highlighting the gap between widespread local acceptance and national law.</p>

World Cup champions Spain are considered favorites, alongside defending champions England, who face injury challenges, and strong contenders like Germany and France. Key players to watch include Spain's Ballon d'Or winners Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas, and Poland's Ewa Pajor.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has come into force, reducing tariffs on key exports. The deal allows British car manufacturers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles annually to the US at a 10% tariff, and eliminates tariffs on UK aerospace exports. In exchange, the UK scraps tariffs on US beef and ethanol, a move criticized by the domestic bioethanol industry. However, a significant point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum are still subject to a 25% tariff, which could double if a separate deal is not reached by the July 9 deadline.

          <p>A law enforcement group is highlighting a trend where several major U.S. cities that increased their police budgets have seen a significant drop in homicides. Data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association for the first quarter of 2025 shows decreased murder rates in cities like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and New York City, all of which boosted police funding in 2024. A spokesperson for the National Police Association suggests this indicates a public rejection of the "defund the police" movement. The article posits a correlation between more police resources and reduced crime rates.</p>
