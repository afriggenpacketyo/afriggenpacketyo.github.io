        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a partial U-turn on winter fuel payments, ensuring that more people will receive the allowance this winter. The payment, worth up to ¬£300, helps cover energy costs during the coldest months. Last winter, the payment was limited to those on pension credit, a policy that was widely criticized. While details are pending the autumn Budget, the government aims to increase eligibility without reverting to the previous system of paying all pensioners, as the pensions minister Torsten Bell stated that millionaires should not be receiving the payment. </p>

          <p>The Netherlands' Rijksmuseum is exhibiting a nearly 200-year-old condom adorned with erotic art, merging art with Amsterdam's Red Light District. The condom, believed to be made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, is part of the "Safe Sex?" exhibition about 19th-century sex work. Decorated with an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen, the condom includes the phrase "This is my choice" in French, referencing the Renoir painting "The Judgment of Paris." The museum acquired the condom at an auction and plans to display it until the end of November. </p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History discovered a previously unknown spiral shape within the Oort Cloud while preparing a planetarium show. During the fine-tuning of "Encounters in the Milky Way," experts noticed a backwards S-shaped spiral in the data representing the inner section of the Oort Cloud. The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. This finding suggests that the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics, may have a more complex structure than previously thought. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced ¬£15 billion in funding for transport projects across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The investment aims to improve tram, train, and bus services, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. This move marks a shift from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The funding will be distributed over five years, from 2027/28 to 2031/32, and is intended to address regional disparities in growth and opportunity. </p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has processed approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act, which is leading to higher benefits and lump-sum retroactive payments for nearly 3 million people. The act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for those receiving income from public pensions without Social Security payroll taxes. The agency credits automation for expediting payments and plans to update all beneficiary records affected by the law by early November.

          <p>UK trade officials expressed relief as the UK was exempted from the doubling of US tariffs on imported steel.

A new provision states that if the deal is not finalized by July 9, the UK's steel tariff rate will increase to 50%. The UK government agreed to cut tariffs on some US beef products and ethanol as part of the deal, creating concerns in the UK ethanol market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a record in quantum-based secure direct communications, trebling the distance of a multi-user network to around 300km. The researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said the optical fibre network was theoretically scalable, showing the viability of this kind of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. This achievement represents a significant step towards realizing long-distance, large-scale quantum communication networks. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in Science suggests that emotions generalize through a signal that lingers in the brain after positive or negative experiences. Researchers found that profound experiences create a sustained signal, like a musical note held with the sustain pedal, allowing it to merge with other experiences. The study involved exposing mice and humans to air puffs, observing brain activity, and using ketamine to disconnect sensory experiences from emotional responses. While some researchers question whether this lingering signal is specific to emotion, the findings could help explain emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions. </p>
