          <p>Japan's SoftBank Group announced a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, surpassing expectations and marking its second straight profitable quarter. The strong performance was primarily driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund investment arm, bolstered by the performance of public companies like Grab and private investments. This positive result comes as the company continues its significant spending on artificial intelligence, including a major investment in OpenAI and the pending acquisition of Ampere Computing.

These actions are part of an ongoing investigation into the extremist group, whose key leaders were arrested in late 2022.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to introduce stricter regulations for the cosmetic surgery industry to combat "cowboy" practitioners following several dangerous incidents, including a death from a botched procedure. The proposed measures aim to protect patients from untrained operators by requiring practitioners to be suitably qualified and regulated for high-risk treatments like Brazilian butt lifts and Botox. These new rules, which will include age restrictions and financial penalties for violations, are intended to improve patient safety and reduce the burden on the NHS from fixing failed procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to cut its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, which would be the fifth reduction since last August and the lowest rate since March 2023. This move would likely reduce mortgage costs for some homeowners but would also result in lower returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation and the employment market cools, even as inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a historic crisis caused by poor yields and soaring prices, the CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed a cautiously optimistic outlook for the industry. A recent bumper harvest, particularly in Spain, has led to a 50% drop in raw material costs and is helping to normalize the market. This recovery is allowing the company, which makes brands like Bertolli, to lower shelf prices and reinvest in marketing, signaling a potential end to the extreme volatility that has recently plagued the sector.</p>

          <p>While international observers have long worried about China's "hidden" local government debt, some experts argue that Beijing is effectively managing the risk through a sweeping debt-restructuring campaign. A massive bond-swap program has allowed local governments to extend repayment periods, bringing the situation under control. These analysts contrast this with the United States, where the growing federal debt burden is seen as a more concerning and less manageable financial challenge for the central government.

The agency acknowledged it is "highly likely" that a portion of UK tyres were diverted to these plants, which cause serious health and environmental damage. While campaigners welcome the move, some argue the new self-certification measures do not go far enough and are calling for a complete ban on exporting whole tyres.</p>

Maintaining normal lithium levels, however, protected their brains, suggesting a potential pathway for new treatments, though scientists caution against self-supplementation until human trials are conducted.</p>
