          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new record high, largely propelled by a significant gain in Home Depot's stock. In contrast, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines as momentum leaders from earlier in the year lost steam. Concurrently, reporting indicates that chipmaker Nvidia is developing a new, more advanced AI processor specifically for the Chinese market, aiming to navigate U.S. export regulations. This development comes as Nvidia seeks to maintain its competitive edge in a key international market while adhering to governmental controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, stating that it expects "meaningful" revenue from President Trump's tariffs to largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency noted that the new law is projected to increase the federal deficit but believes the tariff income will provide a counterbalance. However, S&P issued a warning that the rating could be lowered in the next few years if deficits increase due to political inability to control spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions like the Federal Reserve.

          <p>The integration of artificial intelligence into education is presenting both opportunities and challenges for teachers and students. Advocates, including major tech companies like Microsoft, are investing in training educators to use AI as a tool to save time and enhance lesson plans.

However, critics raise concerns about the potential for cheating and a decline in critical thinking skills, suggesting that improving teachers' working conditions is a better solution than relying on Silicon Valley technology.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the Trump administration plans to take an equity stake in Intel in return for funds from the CHIPS Act. Lutnick stated that instead of providing grants as the Biden administration had, the current administration wants equity for the American people's investment, though it would be non-voting and would not include governance rights. This move aims to ensure taxpayers benefit from the support given to the struggling chipmaker to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The news caused Intel's shares to climb as the government weighs different ways to get involved with the company.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) have become a valuable tool for savers, as top accounts currently offer rates that outpace inflation. This article provides an overview of today's best CD rates, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of about one year currently feature higher rates than longer-term options. The article suggests strategies like CD laddering to help savers take advantage of high short-term rates while planning for long-term financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old mother of four from Utah, Amanda Anderson, initially dismissed a small spot on her nose as dry skin but was later diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma. After a gut feeling prompted a second opinion and a biopsy, she underwent Mohs surgery to remove the cancerous cells, which left a hole the size of a quarter on her nose. Anderson has since documented her experience on social media to raise awareness about skin cancer and the importance of using sunscreen. She is now cancer-free but will require check-ups every six months, and she urges others to be vigilant about skin health.</p>
