          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded August with significant monthly gains, though it experienced a slight retreat in the final week, breaking a four-week winning streak. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the downturn. Despite a slight revenue miss in its data center segment, Nvidia's overall performance was robust, though its stock dipped. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, showed persistent price pressures, but markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September.

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, which lived 165 million years ago. Described as one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, it featured long bony spikes that were uniquely fused directly onto its rib bones, a trait unseen in any other vertebrate. This discovery in Morocco challenges previous theories that ankylosaurs evolved their complex armor later in response to large predators like the T. Rex. The finding suggests their defensive structures were elaborate much earlier than previously understood.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive reelection victory four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. The contest was the town's first formal election since the 1960s, held as part of a federal settlement after Black residents sued to challenge the town's decades-long practice of "hand-me-down governance." Braxton's victory is seen as a significant step toward restoring democratic representation in the majority-Black town.</p>

The event provided a glimpse of Swift's large, custom-designed diamond engagement ring, which has generated significant media attention. The couple, joined by Travis's brother Jason, watched their alma mater, the University of Cincinnati, play. The high-profile relationship has even drawn comments from political figures like Vice President JD Vance, who humorously warned the NFL not to favor the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>

This new show fully embraces the elaborate costumes, props, and song parodies that defined his career. Yankovic explained that he took a break to prove he was more than "just the parody guy" and to explore other creative avenues, including writing. Now, with an expanded band, he is revisiting his classic hits and celebrating the detailed craftsmanship that he believes makes his musical comedy effective.</p>

          <p>In a display of renewed cooperation, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz met to address pressing European issues. The leaders focused on strengthening Europe's "strategic autonomy" in defense, advancing joint military projects, and resolving a long-standing dispute over energy policy. In a key breakthrough, Germany agreed to stop obstructing France's pro-nuclear stance at the EU level, while France will support Germany's hydrogen infrastructure goals. This warming of relations aims to reinvigorate the crucial Franco-German partnership after a period of friction.</p>

He emphasized that cooperation between the two Asian giants could positively impact both regional and global peace and prosperity.

          <p>This personal essay by a father from Uganda captures the profound emotions of watching his son start kindergarten in a well-resourced American public school. He contrasts his son's bright, welcoming classroom with his own first school experience in a rural Ugandan church with a dirt floor. The author reflects on his journey, the generosity of the American family who adopted him, and the simple but powerful miracle of being a present father for a milestone he never experienced with his own. It is a story of gratitude, sacrifice, and the hope for universal educational opportunities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage refinancing still unattractive due to high interest rates, this article outlines alternative methods for seniors to borrow from their home equity. It details three primary options that do not require giving up an existing low-rate mortgage: reverse mortgages for homeowners 62 and older, which provide income without monthly repayments; home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate; and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line with variable rates. These tools can help seniors leverage their home's value in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of large, multigenerational "trophy" ranches in the American West are being put up for sale as heirs either disagree on the properties' future or prefer to liquidate the asset. High-end ranch brokers report a significant increase in listings for these legacy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. These historic ranches often command premium prices due to their vast acreage and proximity to protected public lands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that the administration lacked the authority to end the protections. TPS is a program authorized by Congress that grants temporary legal status to individuals from countries facing severe crises, such as civil strife or natural disasters.</p>
