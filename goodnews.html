          <h2>Home Depot Holds Prices Steady Despite Tariffs, Aims for Market Share</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 11:09:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail announced the retailer intends to maintain current pricing levels despite tariffs, leveraging its scale and supplier partnerships. More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, reducing reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices due to tariffs, and Home Depot sees it as an opportunity to gain market share. CEO Ted Decker noted that high interest rates and economic uncertainty have dampened home improvement spending, with consumers focusing on smaller projects. Despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, anticipating growth driven by improved sales patterns throughout the quarter. </p>

          <p>The FDA has announced new regulatory guidance for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, establishing stricter approval standards for healthy individuals. The FDA will accept immunogenicity data for high-risk groups, but will require randomized, controlled trials showing clinical outcomes for healthy people. This shift comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls health agencies, reflecting a balance between regulatory flexibility and scientific rigor. The agency aims to ensure vaccines for high-risk individuals are approved, while demanding robust data for low-risk individuals. Commissioner Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad will discuss the new framework in a virtual town hall. </p>

          <p>President Trump warned House Republicans not to "f--- around with Medicaid" during a closed-door meeting, as he urged them to pass a major tax bill. The bill's progress is hindered by Republicans seeking cuts to Medicaid, a health-care coverage program for low-income individuals. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program cover nearly 80 million Americans. Trump's blunt message underscores the tension within the party regarding health-care spending. </p>

          <p>Understanding the gold-silver ratio can be a useful tool when investing in precious metals. The gold-silver ratio provides valuable information to investors about where to focus their attention and funds. The formula is based on physical gold bullion and physical silver. Investors view the ratio as an illustration of how relatively cheap or expensive silver is compared to gold. Currently, the price of silver per ounce is around $32, making it a more cost-effective option than gold, but silver tends to be more volatile compared to gold. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Senior homeowners facing financial constraints can consider tapping into their home equity through a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. HELOCs offer flexible financing at lower interest rates, while reverse mortgages allow seniors to access cash without monthly payments. HELOCs are better for short-term needs and those who can afford monthly payments, while reverse mortgages are ideal for seniors with limited financial resources who want to age in place.

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is close to allowing dozens of asset managers to blur the lines between exchange traded funds and mutual funds. This move would give investors more choice while also raising some potential tax risks.
