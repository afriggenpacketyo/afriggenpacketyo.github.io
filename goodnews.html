          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit two solo home runs, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to an 8-5 victory against the New York Yankees in the opening game of their series. Ohtani's first homer answered Aaron Judge's early lead, while his second sparked a four-run sixth inning. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his rhythm and focus on each game after the birth of his child. The Dodgers' win, fueled by Ohtani's performance and Andy Pages' insurance runs, marked a successful start to the series against the Yankees, who were held scoreless after hitting four home runs in the first three innings. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 02:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has led to cheaper products hitting store shelves, attracting consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a lower price, leading to quick sell-outs and long lines. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households, with the government selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers in an effort to curb prices more effectively than previous auction-based methods. The move has been welcomed by consumers seeking relief from high rice costs.</p>
