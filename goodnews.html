          <p>At the World Economic Forum's 'Summer Davos' event, prominent economists argued that China must undergo significant structural reforms to become a consumption-driven economy. They emphasized that relying solely on production and technological supremacy is unsustainable for achieving long-term wealth and harmonious global trade relationships. Panelists suggested that for China to avoid trade friction with the U.S. and other nations, it needs to increase internal consumption, with opportunities present in the services sector and smaller cities.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed it will amend its controversial welfare reform bill after facing a significant rebellion from over 100 of its own MPs. The changes mean that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will now only apply to future claimants, while current recipients will be unaffected. This major concession is seen as a climbdown by the government to ensure the bill passes a crucial vote in the House of Commons and avoids a damaging defeat.</p>

          <p>Tokyo stocks experienced a sharp climb, with the Nikkei 225 index rising above the 40,000 level for the first time in five months.

Investor optimism was further bolstered by gains in the U.S. tech sector and subsiding tensions in the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>
