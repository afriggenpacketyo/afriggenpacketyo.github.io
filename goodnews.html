          <p>The first group of White South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C., and then Texas. The group of 49 Afrikaners, mainly families, are being resettled under an executive order issued by President Trump, who claimed they face government-sponsored race-based discrimination. This initiative stands in contrast to the Trump administration's ban on most other refugees. South Africa's government has denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination.</p>
