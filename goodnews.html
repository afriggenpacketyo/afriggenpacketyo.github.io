          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive a newly licensed drug that could potentially cure her life-threatening inherited disorder. The drug, leniolisib, is the first targeted treatment for Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS), a condition that weakens the immune system. The patient's family was instrumental in the research that identified the faulty gene responsible for the disease in 2013. This medical breakthrough, developed in just 12 years from discovery to NHS-approved treatment, offers new hope for a longer, healthier life for those affected by the rare condition.</p>

          <p>Manchester City delivered a commanding performance in the Club World Cup, defeating Italian side Juventus 5-2 to finish at the top of their group. Manager Pep Guardiola praised his team's aggressive and committed play, calling it a statement victory and a sign that the team has regained its form after a trophyless previous season. The dominant display, which featured goals from Jeremy Doku, Savinho, and Phil Foden, is seen as a strong signal to other teams in the tournament. The return of midfielder Rodri from a long-term injury further bolstered the team's impressive showing.</p>

          <p>McCormick CEO Brendan Foley stated that the spice and flavor company is primarily focused on how new tariffs will affect its agricultural supply chain. While 90% of the company's products sold in the U.S. are manufactured domestically, the majority of its core ingredients, like black pepper, are sourced from various international markets. Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to mitigate the financial impact of the tariffs throughout the year. He also noted that consumer demand for at-home cooking and flavor remains strong despite economic pressures, positioning the company well for the future.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that the current stock market rally is broader and more robust than many critics believe. To demonstrate his point, he reviewed some of the day's top-performing S&P 500 stocks from a wide array of sectors. The list included companies in solar energy (Enphase), mining (Freeport-McMoRan), cryptocurrency (Coinbase), data centers (Super Micro Computer), utilities (NRG Energy), and biotechnology (Incyte). Cramer asserted that this diversity of leadership indicates a healthy, bullish market, challenging the narrative that recent gains have been too narrowly focused on a few large-cap stocks.

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after a harrowing accident where she was impaled by a 6-foot beach umbrella pole. The incident occurred when a gust of wind caught the umbrella she was trying to secure, pulling her off the lifeguard stand and causing her to land on the pole, which went through her armpit. Remarkably, the pole missed all major nerves, tendons, and arteries by a narrow margin. The lifeguard, identified only as Alex, remained calm throughout the ordeal as paramedics used a bandsaw to shorten the pole for transport to the hospital.</p>

The kidnappers believe she is an alien with a plan to destroy Earth.

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images of what is believed to be a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The celestial body, dubbed TWA 7b, orbits a young, nearby star and is estimated to be around the mass of Saturn. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph, which blocks the host star's bright glare, to reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet shaping its surrounding debris disk.</p>

          <p>The presumptive victory of Zohran Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist, in New York's mayoral primary has intensified the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party over its future direction. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assembly member, centered his campaign on bold affordability proposals, defeating the 67-year-old former Governor Andrew Cuomo. His win is seen by some as a sign of momentum for the party's younger, more progressive wing, while moderate Democrats and conservatives have raised concerns about his platform being too extreme.

Despite ongoing risks from tariffs and geopolitical tensions, many investors appear confident that a major downturn can be avoided in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a controversial provision known as the "revenge tax" from President Trump's major legislative package. The decision came after a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who cited a new agreement with G7 countries on a global tax deal. The nixed provision would have allowed the U.S. to impose taxes on foreign-owned companies and investors from countries deemed to have unfair tax policies. Business groups had warned the measure would have cost hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and discouraged foreign investment, creating instability for the global economy.</p>
