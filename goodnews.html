          <p>The Pentagon announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal mission in Los Angeles, which was initiated to address protests against immigration enforcement. This withdrawal accounts for half the troops deployed by President Trump, an action taken despite objections from Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom has called for the remaining forces to be returned as well, stating they have been used as "political pawns." The deployment had sparked a legal battle over presidential authority, with the administration citing the need to quell disorder and protect federal agents.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill that seeks to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation would define legal categories for stablecoins and establish consumer protections, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own versions. Proponents argue this will facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for "depegging" from their underlying asset, as seen during the 2023 banking turmoil.

          <p>Taara, a startup from Google's parent company Alphabet, is positioning itself as a rival to Starlink by seeking a share of the $42.5 billion federal BEAD program for broadband expansion. The company uses wireless "Lightbridge" technology, which beams high-speed internet through the air using light, as an alternative to fiber and satellite. This approach targets the "middle mile" infrastructure gap, connecting the main internet backbone to local networks in remote or difficult-to-wire areas. Recent changes to the BEAD program's rules promoting technology neutrality have opened the door for innovative solutions like Taara's to compete for government funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's leading journal, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's commitment to economic globalization and free trade. Timed with the opening of a major supply chain expo, the piece compiles his statements opposing unilateral sanctions and trade barriers. Xi emphasized that China adheres to the "correct direction of economic globalisation" and rejects the building of "walls and barriers." This public stance positions China as a champion of free trade, in stark contrast to the protectionist policies increasingly seen in the international economic environment.

          <h2>Chinese State Media Encourages Local Governments to Use Legislation to Boost Economic Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 21:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in the People's Daily, a key state newspaper, has urged China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively within a rule-of-law framework. This reflects a shift from relying on top-down directives to using legal mechanisms to address economic challenges. The call comes after a 2015 modification expanded law-drafting powers to hundreds of Chinese cities, enabling them to address local development more directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a groundbreaking effort to save Florida's dwindling coral reefs, scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier strain from Honduras. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection. Researchers hope the new "Flonduran" hybrid will be more resilient to marine heatwaves. The first batch of these crossbred corals has been planted on the reef, a critical first step in a larger project that aims to scale up and restore the vital barrier reef system that protects South Florida's coastlines.</p>

The gold uniform, a first for the team, has generated mixed reactions online, with comparisons ranging from the Minions to mustard bottles. The navy uniform is a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, including their only Super Bowl appearance. The team will also have the option to pair their standard powder blue jerseys with matching powder blue pants.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows countries to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. This approach is often cheaper, supports the local mining industry, and helps formalize the small-scale mining sector. Countries like the Philippines, Ghana, and Colombia are actively using this method to increase their gold holdings amidst surging global prices and geopolitical uncertainty.

Torres was convicted in 2001 based on shaky witness testimony, despite having a solid alibi and a cast on his arm that would have made firing a gun difficult. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, leading to the civil settlement for his two decades of wrongful incarceration.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Prof. Gillian Leng, also calls for standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns from patients and doctors' unions about the lack of clarity and potential safety risks associated with the roles, which were introduced to support doctors but have seen their responsibilities expand without a clear national plan.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for an ambitious five-year renovation project costing £50 million. The 175-year-old Victorian glasshouse requires extensive repairs due to the toll taken by its internal hot and humid rainforest environment. The project will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing rusted ironwork, and moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the makeover is to upgrade the heating systems to make the iconic building net-zero in terms of carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>A Seoul court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who was executed for assassinating South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim, who was the head of the KCIA, shot Park during a dinner, an act he claimed was necessary to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy. He was convicted of treason and insurrection by a military court, but his family has long argued the trial was unjust and politically motivated by the new military regime. The retrial re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history, forcing a modern reflection on a man viewed by some as a traitor and others as a patriot.</p>
