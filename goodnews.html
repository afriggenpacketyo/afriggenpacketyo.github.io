          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year agreement to become the exclusive U.S. streaming home for the WWE's premium live events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, starting in 2026. The deal, valued at an average of $325 million annually, marks a significant increase from the previous rights holder, Peacock. All major events will be available on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with some also airing on its linear networks. This partnership aims to expand WWE's audience and help ESPN attract a younger, more diverse viewership beyond traditional sports.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its streaming services and theme parks. While overall revenue saw a modest 2% rise, it fell just short of projections, weighed down by a 15% revenue dip in the traditional TV business. The direct-to-consumer streaming segment grew, with Disney+ adding 1.8 million subscribers, and the company raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in its growth trajectory.

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that financially distressed football clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. Her comments come as a new bill establishing an independent football regulator has become law, though the body is not yet operational. Nandy emphasized that the regulator will have powers to force ownership changes and implement stronger tests for potential owners, which she believes will prevent clubs from failing. She cited her own experience with Wigan Athletic as an example of how last-minute resolutions can be achieved, urging fans not to give up hope.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new cultural trend, dubbed "AI veganism," is emerging among individuals who choose to abstain from using artificial intelligence for ethical, environmental, and personal wellness reasons. The article draws a parallel to traditional veganism, noting that practitioners are concerned about the collateral damage of AI, from its large energy and water consumption to its impact on creative labor. While acknowledging that widespread adoption may be unrealistic, the author suggests the movement highlights a growing need for greater awareness about the hidden costs of AI. The piece humorously notes that, like regular vegans, AI vegans will likely be vocal about their choice.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China will waive tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also includes tuition reductions for private kindergartens, is part of a broader plan to make preschool education free and ease the financial burden on families. The central government will subsidize local governments to offset the loss in revenue, with funding levels based on each region's fiscal strength. This move aims to lower education costs and encourage procreation amid a slowing economy and weak labor market.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California must reconsider its policy that prohibits hiring students who lack legal immigration status for on-campus jobs. The court found that the university's justification for the policy—fear of violating federal law and potential retaliation—was insufficient and that the policy is discriminatory under state law. While the ruling does not force the UC system to hire undocumented students, it mandates a re-evaluation based on proper legal criteria. This decision is a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates who argue the ban denies students crucial financial and career opportunities.</p>

          <p>An exhibition in San Francisco showcases the work of West Coast architects who were profoundly influenced by Bruce Goff, the unconventional designer of LACMA's Japanese Pavilion. As chair of the University of Oklahoma's architecture school, Goff fostered a radical spirit of self-expression and contextual design, which became known as the American School. The article details how his students, including Mickey Muennig and John Marsh Davis, brought this ethos to California, creating unique structures that merged with the landscape and celebrated structural elements as art. Their work stands in stark contrast to the dominant, rigid modernism of the era.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia is leading a renewed international effort to recognize a Palestinian state, a move seen as both a strategic diplomatic maneuver and a revival of its 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. This push, which has gained support from several European nations, is driven by multiple factors, including the need for regional stability to achieve Saudi Arabia's own economic diversification goals. The article suggests that by championing this cause, Riyadh is consolidating its influence in the Arab world, countering its past image as a "traitor" to the Palestinian cause, and positioning itself as a key player in any post-war regional architecture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "clanker," a derogatory term for robots originating from the "Star Wars" universe, has gone viral on social media, reflecting a cultural need to respond to the proliferation of AI. Linguists note that the onomatopoeic term is being used to express frustration with everything from delivery robots to AI chatbots replacing human jobs. The trend has spawned memes about "robot racism" and a future where robots are a discriminated-against class. The article suggests this linguistic development is a direct response to societal anxieties, particularly among Gen Z, about AI's growing impact on the workforce.</p>
