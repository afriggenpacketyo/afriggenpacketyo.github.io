        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber is partnering with electric vehicle maker Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis in the next six years. As part of the deal, Uber will invest $300 million into Lucid, which will supply the vehicles. Nuro will provide the Level 4 self-driving technology, allowing the cars to operate without a human driver under most conditions. This collaboration aims to launch in a major U.S. city next year, expanding Uber's footprint in the autonomous ride-hailing market and creating a new commercial avenue for Lucid's EV technology.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 08:35:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has cleared the names of Errol Campbell and Ronald De Souza, who were wrongly convicted in the 1970s based on fabricated evidence from a corrupt British Transport Police officer, Derek Ridgewell. Ridgewell, who died in prison in 1982, systematically framed young Black men for theft and robbery. This marks the 13th such conviction to be overturned, with the court expressing regret for the decades of suffering endured by the victims and their families. The case has renewed calls for automatic reviews of convictions involving officers later found to be corrupt.</p>

          <h2>Disney's 70-Year Strategy of Integrating IP into Theme Parks Continues to Drive Profit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 08:31:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, the company's strategy of leveraging its vast intellectual property portfolio remains a cornerstone of its success. The experiences division, which includes theme parks and resorts, is a major profit driver, fueled by acquisitions like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. This approach involves creating immersive lands and attractions based on popular franchises, from classic films to modern blockbusters like "Avatar" and "The Avengers." While this sometimes means replacing older, non-IP-based rides, the strategy successfully broadens the parks' appeal and boosts revenue across Disney's global footprint.</p>

          <p>Welch's has announced it will eliminate artificial dyes from its popular fruit snacks, replacing them with colors derived from natural sources. The change will first apply to its Mixed Fruit, Berries 'n Cherries, and Fruit Punch varieties ahead of the back-to-school season. This move aligns with a broader industry trend and a recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative to remove synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Blue 1 from food supplies. The company aims to use exclusively natural-source colors across its entire product portfolio by early 2026, prioritizing consumer demand for healthier ingredients.</p>

          <p>The African Union's 2018 Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, intended to complement the continent's free trade area, is facing significant delays. Only four of the 55 member states have ratified the agreement, far short of the 15 needed for it to take effect. Many nations cite security concerns, fearing that open borders could exacerbate issues like terrorism, as a primary reason for their reluctance. Other hurdles include the lack of harmonized border systems and fears of losing revenue from visa fees. The AU is promoting peer-to-peer learning, using Rwanda as a successful model to encourage other countries to ratify the protocol.</p>

          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars is shifting its U.S. production strategy to mitigate the impact of trade tariffs, despite reporting better-than-expected second-quarter profits. The company plans to add production of its best-selling XC60 SUV to its South Carolina plant, a move to localize a high-volume model and better utilize the factory. Simultaneously, Volvo is phasing out sedans and station wagons from its U.S. lineup due to waning demand and the financial pressures of tariffs on imported vehicles. The strategic changes reflect the challenging environment automakers face, forcing them to adapt their product portfolios to new economic realities. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact check by DW has determined that the claim circulating on social media that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer is false. Health officials and scientific evidence confirm that there is no support for this association; in fact, sunscreen is crucial for filtering the UV radiation that causes skin cancer. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products. While countries with high sunscreen use, like Australia, also have high skin cancer rates, this correlation does not imply causation, as many other lifestyle and environmental factors are involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing global health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Scientific research suggests that beating this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Effective, evidence-based methods include physical changes like leaving the phone out of the bedroom, digital adjustments like turning off notifications, and using self-control apps. For more severe cases, therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction, which often stem from a desire to escape stress or other mental health challenges.</p>

          <p>Russian customs officials, in collaboration with the FSB security service, have seized 1,800 pounds of cocaine valued at over $153 million. The drugs were discovered hidden in a shipment of bananas originating from Latin America, marking Russia's largest bust from the region this year. The cocaine packages were concealed in a hidden compartment within the banana containers and disguised with the label of a luxury fashion brand. This seizure is part of a growing trend where drug traffickers use Russia as a transit hub, often concealing narcotics in banana shipments, a method also seen in recent busts across Europe.</p>
