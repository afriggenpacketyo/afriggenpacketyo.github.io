          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men aged 18 to 22, who are not subject to immediate military conscription, to cross national borders unhindered. This policy reversal, announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and supported by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, aims to provide young Ukrainians with broader opportunities for education, internships, and legal employment abroad. The government hopes the experience gained will ultimately contribute to Ukraine's development, countering fears of losing an entire generation to emigration. While some experts predict a greater outflow, others believe the impact on demographics will not be critical, as many who wished to leave have already done so.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic, at 38 years old, made history by becoming the oldest man to reach the US Open fourth round since 1991, securing a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 victory over Cameron Norrie. The 24-time Grand Slam champion overcame a persistent lower back injury, which necessitated an on-court medical timeout, demonstrating remarkable resilience. This win also tied Roger Federer's record for the most Grand Slam fourth-round appearances with 69. Norrie, despite the loss, delivered his best performance against Djokovic, pushing him to a tie-break and showing significant improvement in his game, indicating his re-establishment among the world's top players.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to expand speedy deportations of undocumented migrants detained within the United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb suggested that the administration's broadened use of the expedited removal statute, which allows migrants to be removed without appearing before a judge, infringes upon individuals' due process rights. This ruling is a setback for President Trump's campaign promise to significantly increase deportations, as the judge emphasized that due process must be afforded to individuals, regardless of their entry status, when applying such a statute to a large, new group of people.</p>

          <p>Taylor Townsend delivered a career-best performance at the US Open, upsetting No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 to reach the fourth round, her best major result since 2019.

Townsend, a former world No. 1 junior, emphasized the importance of showing up as her authentic self, a message resonating with many, including fellow tennis stars.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie experienced his seventh career defeat against Novak Djokovic at the US Open, losing 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-3 in a hard-fought fourth-round match. Norrie reflected on being "a little overconfident" after an early third-set break, which Djokovic, despite a lower back injury, managed to overcome. This article details Norrie's significant career resurgence over recent months, following a challenging 2024 season impacted by a forearm injury and a slump in confidence. His strong performances, including reaching the French Open fourth round and Wimbledon quarter-finals, demonstrate his re-establishment among the world's top players, and he expressed taking considerable confidence from pushing a Grand Slam champion.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile scenic stretch of Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022 and 2023 caused slope failures and collapsed pavement, with further damage from the Bridge fire in September 2024. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening provides crucial access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding on other routes. However, the timing coincides with an extreme fire danger warning for Angeles National Forest, raising concerns among some community members.</p>

          <p>Chinese stocks have reached a 10-year high, attracting both retail and overseas investors seeking better investment alternatives. Investment director Jian Shi Cortesi of GAM Investments anticipates a continued rally, driven by domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's focus on technological innovation. Cortesi believes Chinese equities, including A and H shares, offer "undervalued innovation" in advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics, presenting significant catch-up potential compared to other global markets trading near historical highs. This positive sentiment follows two months of foreign inflows, reversing years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plans to terminate temporary protected status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, allowing them to continue living and working in the US. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The court emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision is a significant setback for the administration's broader efforts to reduce legal temporary immigration programs, though its immediate impact on those whose protections already expired remains unclear.</p>

The security guard, Emani Ellis, claims Cardi B cut her cheek and spat on her, leaving her traumatized. Cardi B, however, testified that Ellis invaded her privacy by filming her during a private pregnancy appointment, leading to a verbal altercation but no physical contact. Moments from the cross-examination, including questions about her wigs and nails, have amused social media users, while also sparking debate about potential racial or misogynistic undertones in the questioning. The trial is expected to conclude next week.</p>

Siena, 13, reported her attendance more than doubled after participating, crediting her three-year-old mentee with teaching her communication and confidence. The charity Power2, which runs the scheme in London and Manchester, found that giving disengaged teens responsibility for younger children in a controlled setting fosters accountability and positive attitudes towards learning. With school absence nearly doubling since the pandemic, this initiative offers a novel approach to building self-esteem and re-engaging young people with their education, benefiting both mentors and mentees.</p>
