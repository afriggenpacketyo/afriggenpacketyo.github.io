        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has announced the bank's intention to get involved with stablecoins, despite his personal skepticism about their utility compared to traditional payment systems. This strategic move is driven by the need to understand the technology and stay competitive against fintech rivals who are innovating in the payments space. The bank, which moves nearly $10 trillion daily, sees this as a necessary step to avoid ceding ground in the evolving financial landscape. Dimon emphasized that being involved is crucial to being cognizant of the competitive threats posed by new financial technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with significant tariffs. In a social media post, Trump described it as a "great deal, for everybody," attributing it to direct negotiations with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. However, he did not provide any specific details about the terms of the agreement, stating that more information would be released later. This follows a similar pattern to a recent announcement about a trade deal with Vietnam, where details were initially scarce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump announced an agreement with NATO allies to facilitate large-scale arms deliveries to Ukraine, including critically needed Patriot missile systems. The deal involves European nations purchasing billions of dollars in military equipment from the U.S. and distributing it to the battlefield, with initial deliveries expected within days. Trump also issued a 50-day deadline to Russia to make peace, threatening severe secondary sanctions on countries trading with Moscow if the deadline is not met. This marks a dramatic change from the administration's previous skepticism about Ukraine's prospects and U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>The announcement of the 2025 Emmy nominations brought both expected celebrations and surprising oversights, sparking discussion across the television industry. While "The White Lotus" received widespread recognition with seven cast members nominated, some critics noted a lack of imagination from voters. Conversely, acclaimed shows like "The Pitt" received fewer nominations than anticipated, and popular actors such as Steve Martin for "Only Murders in the Building" were unexpectedly snubbed. The analysis highlights the competitive nature of the awards and the difficult choices voters face, leading to both elation for nominees and disappointment for those left out.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged, trading near its all-time high after briefly surpassing $123,000, driven by structural demand from institutional investors rather than retail mania. The recent approval and massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $153 billion in assets, have significantly tightened supply and legitimized the asset. This rally is further supported by growing adoption from corporations and the prospect of clearer U.S. regulations, with Congress considering landmark crypto bills. This confluence of Wall Street adoption and policy momentum is reinforcing bitcoin's position as a mainstream macroeconomic asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's trading operations capitalized on market volatility, with fixed income revenue climbing 14% to $5.7 billion. Despite CEO Jamie Dimon's repeated warnings about economic risks from trade policy and fiscal deficits, the bank raised its full-year guidance for net interest income. The strong results allowed the bank to boost dividends and share repurchases, reflecting resilience in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent report commissioned by the UK government is expected to recommend tighter regulations and a major modernization drive to address the long-standing issue of sewage pollution in the nation's rivers. For years, private water companies have faced criticism for illegal discharges, leading to environmental damage in protected areas like the River Kennet. Advocacy groups blame a lack of investment and a regulatory focus on low bills for the crisis. The forthcoming report, led by a former Bank of England official, may propose comprehensive reforms to improve infrastructure and regulatory oversight without fully renationalizing the industry.</p>

          <p>In a move aimed at improving diplomatic ties, Beijing has lifted the sanctions it imposed in 2021 on Reinhard Buetikofer, a former German member of the European Parliament known for his criticism of the Chinese government. The decision was communicated in a letter to the European Parliament president and is expected to pave the way for renewed engagement between the two bodies. An official meeting between the EU Parliament's China delegation and China's National People's Congress is now tentatively planned for October. The removal of sanctions on Buetikofer was reportedly a key demand from the EU side before normalizing relations.</p>

          <p>Financial expert Jaspreet Singh outlines five common "money lies" that he believes prevent many Americans from building wealth, even those with high incomes. These misconceptions include viewing a primary home as an investment, believing a job alone can make you wealthy, and thinking you need to be rich to start investing. Singh argues that true wealth comes from investing, not just earning, and that even small, consistent contributions can grow into a substantial sum over time. He also advises against treating bankers as trusted financial advisors and relying solely on a 401(k) for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This week is pivotal for the cryptocurrency industry in Washington, as the House is set to vote on two major regulatory bills. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, could become the first standalone crypto law. A more comprehensive market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, also has strong support but faces a more uncertain path due to some lawmakers' concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto ventures. The industry, led by companies like Coinbase, is heavily lobbying for the passage of these bills to create regulatory certainty and encourage investment. (not investment advice)</p>
