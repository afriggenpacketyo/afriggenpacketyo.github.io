          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have departed for China as their loan agreement expires. The pandas‚Äîa 24-year-old female named Rauhin and her three offspring‚Äîwere sent to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves just two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both located at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, who are also scheduled to return by next February. The Wakayama-based zoo has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, raising 17 cubs, the most outside of China.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the conflict between Israel and Iran. The author suggests that while unconventional for a president, the moment came across as authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many observers. The piece argues that in an era of scripted political spin, judicious and genuine use of strong language can make politicians seem more human and trustworthy to the public. While not advocating for constant profanity, the author posits that such moments can cut through political noise and powerfully emphasize a message during critical times.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration navigated a momentous week marked by significant victories and unresolved challenges that could shape his presidency. Key wins included a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions against his executive orders and securing increased defense spending from NATO allies. The administration also touted the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran following U.S. strikes. However, major challenges remain, including the urgent need to finalize numerous trade deals before a July deadline and ensuring his comprehensive tax and policy bill passes the Senate to become law.</p>

          <p>Facing a surge in Russian airstrikes using modernized Shahed drones, Ukraine is intensifying its focus on developing and deploying interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized drones are designed to be faster and more agile, capable of pursuing and destroying Russian drones that now fly at higher altitudes, evading traditional ground-based defenses. Experts and officials, including President Zelenskyy, highlight that interceptor drones offer a more cost-effective and efficient solution compared to expensive anti-aircraft missiles. Ukrainian manufacturers are already ramping up production and training pilots for this new form of aerial combat.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations that oversee and run parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. This move is part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, aimed at simplifying a system Health Secretary Wes Streeting described as overly complex. Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. The government stated the goal is to have "more doers and fewer checkers" and to amplify patient feedback directly through tools like the NHS smartphone app.</p>

          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment systems like WeChat and Alipay provide a significant advantage in the global stablecoin race. He argues that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 to fiat currency and are supported by a mature regulatory framework. This existing infrastructure, which requires customer funds to be backed by central bank money, offers inherent stability. The analysis comes as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain competitive in the evolving landscape of digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic remote draft, held with team executives in their home markets, has drawn criticism from some traditionalists like Kings GM Ken Holland. The new format, which featured technical glitches and a slower pace, lacked the energy of having all teams and prospects in one arena. While top pick Matthew Schaefer said the experience was still an honor, some GMs lamented the loss of the spontaneous, emotional moments that characterized the old, centralized draft. The Kings traded down in the first round to select defenseman Henry Brzustewicz, while the Ducks used their 10th overall pick on forward Roger McQueen.</p>

Unlike the open-skull surgery used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, this method involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature via a vein in the neck. The trial involved a 67-year-old paralyzed patient who was able to regain some limb movement following the procedure. This innovative approach reportedly reduces surgical risk and significantly shortens recovery time, marking a potential advancement in neurotechnology.</p>
