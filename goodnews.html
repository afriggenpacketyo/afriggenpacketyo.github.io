          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its financial forecast for the year, buoyed by increasing sales to home improvement professionals that compensated for a decrease in demand from do-it-yourself customers.

Despite falling slightly short of quarterly sales expectations, Lowe's surpassed earnings estimates, anticipating improved sales trends with better weather and increased demand for spring-related items. The company is also diversifying its imports to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's government aims to "reset" relations with the Trump administration during President Ramaphosa's working visit to the US. The visit seeks to correct unfounded allegations made by the Trump administration, including claims of white farmers being killed in a "genocide" and land being stolen due to expropriation laws. Afrikaner lobby groups have engaged with Trump, but even they were surprised by his decision to grant these groups refugee status. The article quotes Dr. Theo de Jager, president of the Southern African Agri Alliance, who states that while farm murder is a concern, it cannot be equated to genocide.</p>
