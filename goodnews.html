          <p>A federal appeals court has denied an emergency request from the Trump administration that sought to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The 2-1 decision ensures Cook will participate in the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where interest rates are set. The administration had moved to oust Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to exert more direct control over the central bank's leadership.</p>

After fleeing political persecution and waiting 18 months in the U.S., Ali learned his hearing might not occur until 2027 or 2028. Despite the prolonged uncertainty and difficult living conditions in a migrant shelter, he has obtained a work permit, pays taxes, and remains hopeful about his future in America.

          <p>Former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino is publicly sharing his experience with Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatosis Hepatitis (MASH), a form of fatty liver disease he was diagnosed with in 2007. Partnering with a campaign called Unordinary Stories, Marino aims to raise awareness about the condition, which affects an estimated one in 20 Americans. He emphasizes that the disease is manageable with early detection, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Marino hopes that by discussing his health journey, he can encourage others to get regular medical checkups and take a proactive, positive approach to their well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is re-evaluating the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for menopause, potentially leading to the removal of stringent "black box" warnings on certain treatments. Many medical experts now argue that the risks, such as breast cancer and stroke, were overstated by a flawed 2002 study that focused on older women. More recent research indicates that the therapy is safer and more effective when started closer to the onset of menopause. This potential change could make the treatment more accessible for women seeking relief from severe perimenopausal symptoms like hot flashes.</p>

          <p>Following the destructive Eaton Fire in Altadena, California, the Pasadena Run Club has transformed into a vital support system for its members who lost everything. About a dozen runners from the club saw their homes destroyed, including Carl Walton, who watched his burn down. In response, the club immediately organized fundraisers and provided essential aid like temporary shelter, food, and clothing. This community-led effort highlights the importance of local networks in the aftermath of natural disasters, offering both material help and emotional relief to those affected as they begin the slow process of recovery.</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannual</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 18:48:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, an idea the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, contrasting it with what he described as China's long-term corporate view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors. The change would require a majority vote from the SEC, not congressional action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists from UCLA and the Bay Foundation are releasing a nontoxic, fluorescent pink dye into the waters near the Santa Monica Pier to study ocean circulation patterns. The research aims to understand why the area consistently ranks among California's dirtiest beaches, with a focus on how a man-made breakwater from the 1930s may be trapping pollutants by hindering water flow. By tracking the dye's movement, researchers hope to gather data that can inform solutions to improve the bay's water quality. Officials have assured the public that the temporary dye poses no risk to people or marine life.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a framework for a deal that would allow the social media app TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. The app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has faced scrutiny over national security concerns related to data privacy and potential propaganda. Any final agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to address these concerns. This development comes ahead of a September 17 deadline imposed by the administration, highlighting the political sensitivity of banning an app with approximately 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The bill includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for officials to conceal information or mislead inquiries, aiming to prevent cover-ups like those seen after the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster. Campaigners, including families of the 97 victims, have welcomed the news, seeing it as a landmark step toward accountability. The law is also intended to apply to other state-related tragedies, such as the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office scandal.</p>

          <p>The introduction of the 'Hillsborough Law' marks a pivotal moment in a decades-long struggle for justice by the families of the 97 people who died in the 1989 stadium disaster. This article traces the history of the campaign, which emerged from the injustices exposed during the protracted legal battles and inquests. The law's core principles—a legal duty of candour for public officials and equal funding for legal representation for victims—were designed to prevent other families from enduring a similar, adversarial fight for truth. The legislation aims to create a more balanced and transparent justice system in the aftermath of state-related tragedies.</p>
