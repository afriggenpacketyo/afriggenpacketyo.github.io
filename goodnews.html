          <p>The meticulous five-year, £80m restoration of London's iconic Elizabeth Tower, widely known as Big Ben, has earned a nomination for the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stirling Prize. This prestigious award, typically honoring new constructions, acknowledges the project's exceptional design vision, innovation, and originality, marking it as a "veritable masterclass in conservation and craftsmanship." Despite going over its original budget, the refurbishment included crucial repairs to the clock mechanism, a return to Victorian blue and gold on the clock faces, and accessibility enhancements like a new lift. The nomination celebrates the project's significant contribution to architecture and the built environment, showcasing how historic preservation can enrich society.</p>

          <p>C-SPAN, the nonprofit organization renowned for its nonpartisan, gavel-to-gavel coverage of U.S. government, has announced new distribution agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV. These deals are set to expand access to C-SPAN's three channels for millions of subscribers nationwide, bolstering its role as a crucial source of public affairs programming. The move addresses C-SPAN's financial challenges, which stemmed from a significant decline in traditional pay-TV homes, leading to a public plea for wider streaming adoption and a supportive U.S. Senate resolution. This strategic shift ensures the network's continued ability to provide essential transparency into the democratic process, adapting to evolving media consumption habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Great Salt Lake, the Western Hemisphere's largest saline lake, is revealing "stunning" discoveries as its waters recede due to climate change and unsustainable consumption. University of Utah scientists are mapping mysterious groundwater-fed oases hidden beneath the exposed lakebed, identified by reed-covered mounds and unusual surface disturbances. These formations suggest a vast subsurface plumbing system that delivers fresh water under pressure, a phenomenon previously unconfirmed. Researchers believe understanding these hidden freshwater reserves could be vital for restoring the lakebed's fragile crusts, reducing dust pollution, and uncovering long-buried secrets of the region’s hydrology. This scientific breakthrough offers potential avenues for environmental mitigation in a critical ecosystem.</p>

This win served as sweet revenge for Anisimova, who had suffered a crushing defeat to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final less than two months prior. The American's fearless ball-striking and composure throughout the match secured her first US Open semi-final berth. Anisimova's journey back into the top 50 after a mental health hiatus in 2023 adds a layer of resilience to this historic achievement, making her the first American woman since 2002 to reach Grand Slam semi-finals on all three surfaces.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has reached a settlement in a long-fought lawsuit, agreeing to provide extensive tutoring and support for an estimated 100,000 students impacted by pandemic-related learning setbacks. Five years after the initial disruption, the agreement mandates at least 45 hours of high-dose tutoring annually for the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The lawsuit, brought by parents, alleged that LAUSD failed to meet state educational standards, disproportionately harming Black and Latino students. This settlement aims to address the significant academic damage caused by school closures and inadequate online instruction during the COVID-19 era.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged 9% after a federal judge ruled against forcing Google to divest its Chrome browser in a high-profile antitrust case, deeming such a move "incredibly messy and highly risky." While sparing Google from the most severe penalty, U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta did impose other limits, such as requiring Google to share some search data with rivals to foster competition. Advocacy groups expressed disappointment, but experts view it as a significant win for Google. The decision comes as artificial intelligence reshapes online search, potentially altering Google's massive advertising business in the future.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has made a landmark ruling, allowing cutting-edge advanced DNA testing to be used in the upcoming trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This decision marks the first time such evidence, specifically whole genome sequencing, could be admitted in a New York court, setting a significant statewide precedent. Prosecutors successfully argued that this method, capable of extracting DNA from degraded or rootless hair strands, is scientifically reliable. The defense has challenged the ruling, citing concerns about the lab's licensing, but the approval is a major victory for prosecutors, potentially revolutionizing forensic DNA analysis in the state.</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance announced there are "no immediate plans" for the federal government to deploy National Guard forces to Chicago, despite President Trump's recent suggestions about intervening in the city's crime rates. Trump had previously indicated a deployment was imminent, drawing strong criticism and legal threats from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who cited declining violent crime statistics. Vance emphasized the administration's hope to collaborate with Pritzker, echoing Trump's desire for a state request. This clarification comes amidst broader discussions about federal intervention in major U.S. cities and potential legal challenges to such deployments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled illegal the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, concluding it was retaliatory and violated the university's First Amendment rights. The administration had imposed the freeze after Harvard rejected demands related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and screening international students for ideological biases, including antisemitism. While the judge acknowledged Harvard should have done more to address antisemitism, she stated that fighting it was not the government's "true aim," suggesting an ideologically motivated assault on universities. This decision safeguards critical research projects and academic freedom.</p>
