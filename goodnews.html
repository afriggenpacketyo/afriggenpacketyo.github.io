          <p>CNBC reports that Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, easing U.S.-China trade tensions, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The price of Bitcoin reached as high as $109,857, reflecting a 15% increase for the month. Inflows into exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion, with reduced selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. Investors anticipate regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further boost Bitcoin prices, as the number of Bitcoins held by public companies has grown significantly.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that Nike will resume selling its products directly on Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019. The sneaker giant initially stopped selling wholesale on Amazon to distribute more directly to customers and control the shopping experience amid concerns about counterfeit products. Nike's spokesperson stated that the company is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers, while Amazon mentioned it will soon source a wider range of Nike products directly to expand its selection. This deal represents a win for Amazon as it seeks to attract more high-end brands to its platform.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that China has launched a cluster of 12 satellites, forming the foundation of the world‚Äôs first orbital computing constellation, signaling its ambition to dominate space-based computational power. This system, a collaboration between Guoxing Aerospace and Zhejiang Lab, aims to process data in orbit, leveraging solar energy and lower cooling demands. The constellation promises speed and efficiency for applications like disaster response, cutting reliance on terrestrial grids and reducing the need for cooling. This launch positions China as a leader in the race for space-based AI computing dominance.</p>
