        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Oversight Committee has retracted its subpoena compelling former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. A committee aide confirmed the withdrawal was due to new information about Mueller's health, which precludes him from testifying. The New York Times recently reported that the 81-year-old former FBI director was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021. The subpoena was part of a broader investigation into the handling of the Epstein case, for which the committee sought Mueller's knowledge from his time as FBI director between 2001 and 2013.</p>

          <p>A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the northern lights visible across 18 U.S. states. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the celestial display is anticipated to peak late Monday into early Tuesday morning. While not expected to be as intense as the major storms of 2024, it presents a significant viewing opportunity for skygazers in states as far south as Illinois and Oregon. Forecasters recommend finding a dark location away from city lights for the best chance to witness the aurora.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, a Polish CEO, has publicly apologized after a video of him taking a hat from a young boy at the US Open went viral. Szczerek claimed he made a "huge mistake," believing tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was tossing the hat in his direction. Following widespread criticism, he stated his actions were unintentional and that he returned the hat to the boy to repair the damage done. Majchrzak, who was unaware of the incident at the time, later met with the young fan and gave him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently abolished peak-time fares, meaning passengers will pay the same price regardless of when they travel on weekdays. The move, which follows a government-funded pilot program, is aimed at encouraging more commuters to switch from cars to trains, thereby reducing traffic and benefiting the environment. A journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow during peak hours will now be nearly 50% cheaper. The Scottish government expects the policy to cost between £40m to £45m annually, an investment they believe is sustainable and will provide significant savings for the public.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has announced his six wildcard picks, creating one of the most consistent teams in the event's history. The selections—Shane Lowry, Jon Rahm, Sepp Straka, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Aberg, and Matt Fitzpatrick—all played in the 2023 victory in Rome. They join six automatic qualifiers, with Rasmus Hojgaard being the only new member of the 12-man squad. Donald acknowledged the challenge of playing an away match in New York, stating that despite the team's continuity, he has implemented new techniques to prepare for the difficult environment at Bethpage Black.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, financial experts are highlighting short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as offering the most competitive returns for savers this September. Many professionals point to six-month terms as the current "sweet spot," providing attractive yields without locking up funds for extended periods. While longer-term CDs historically offered higher rates, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative for maximizing returns. Savers are encouraged to balance the need for liquidity with the opportunity to lock in current rates before they potentially decline further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amanda Goetz, a marketing executive and startup founder, advises ambitious professionals to adopt a strategy of "sustainable ambition" to prevent burnout. She defines this as intentionally scheduling cycles of hard work followed by periods of proactive rest, rather than pushing relentlessly until exhaustion forces a stop. Goetz shares her personal experience of being hospitalized with panic attacks while building her second company, a moment that prompted her to reprioritize her life. She argues that success is not about having everything at once, but about building a rhythm that allows for both professional achievement and personal well-being.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vonda Wright, an orthopedic surgeon and longevity specialist, argues that women can age with power by making daily investments in their health, particularly during their "critical decade" from age 35 to 45. In her new book, she emphasizes that aging is not an inevitable decline and encourages women to focus on mobility, smart nutrition, and a resilient mindset. Wright advises a diet high in protein to maintain lean muscle, along with an exercise regimen that includes flexibility, aerobic activity, heavy weightlifting, and balance training.

          <p>This opinion article argues that to maximize the environmental benefits of electric vehicles, California should prioritize expanding workplace charging infrastructure. The author, part of a UC San Diego research team, explains that the cleanest and cheapest time to charge an EV is midday, when the grid is rich with solar power. However, most EV owners currently charge overnight at home, using electricity primarily generated from natural gas. Encouraging daytime charging at offices would better utilize renewable energy, further slash emissions, and help stabilize the power grid, but requires stronger incentives and policy support.</p>

          <p>This personal essay delves into the anxiety and vulnerability associated with sharing a favorite movie, in this case "The Big Lebowski," with a new friend. The author explores the psychology behind this common experience, noting that sharing cultural tastes is a way of revealing one's identity, and a negative reaction can feel like a personal rejection. Psychologists explain that friendships are often built on similarities, and discovering a difference in taste can challenge our perception of that bond. The essay concludes that while the risk is real, a shared appreciation can ultimately affirm and strengthen a friendship.</p>

          <p>Actress Alicia Silverstone attributes her graceful aging to the plant-based diet she adopted in the 1990s. She reports that after giving up meat, she experienced clearer thinking and noticed her hair and nails becoming thicker and stronger. Health experts support the benefits of such diets, which are linked to a lower risk of stroke, heart disease, and certain cancers. In addition to personal health advantages, plant-based eating is also more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective than meat-heavy diets. For those looking to make a change, experts suggest a gradual transition by slowly replacing meat with plant-based proteins like lentils and beans.</p>
