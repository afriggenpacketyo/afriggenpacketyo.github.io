          <p>Australia's women's cricket team, led by captain Alyssa Healy, secured a remarkable victory against India in the World Cup by successfully chasing a record-breaking target. India set a formidable total of 330 runs, the highest ever conceded by Australia in a one-day international, powered by a strong opening partnership. In response, Healy delivered a masterful performance, scoring 142 runs off 107 balls to anchor the chase. Despite a late-game rally from India's bowlers, Australia reached the target with six balls to spare, marking the highest successful run chase in women's ODI history.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 13:32:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To cultivate mental strength in children, parents should avoid certain common behaviors that can inadvertently create weakness. According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families, these practices include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, and silencing their big emotions. Instead, parents are encouraged to let children face age-appropriate challenges, take responsibility for their own mistakes, and validate their feelings to build resilience. The article emphasizes that fostering autonomy, avoiding making children responsible for parental emotions, and teaching the value of rest are also crucial for developing emotionally healthy and self-reliant individuals.</p>

          <p>A newcomer to the sport, Matt Cross from Lincolnshire, has been crowned the World Conker Champion at the 60th annual event held in Northamptonshire. The competition, which saw hundreds of participants, gained extra attention this year following a cheating scandal in the previous tournament. Cross defeated women's champion Mags Blake in the final round to claim the overall title. Organizers overcame fears of a cancellation due to a shortage of quality conkers from a dry summer, receiving donations from across Europe, including from the Royal estate at Windsor Castle, to ensure the historic event could proceed.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where a peace plan for Gaza is expected to be signed. Downing Street announced that Starmer will pay tribute to the diplomatic efforts of the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey in brokering the agreement. The summit follows the implementation of the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas. The UK government's role in the negotiations has been a point of contention, with some Israeli officials disputing claims of significant British involvement in shaping the peace plan.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the US-brokered peace plan for Gaza is underway, involving a ceasefire and a significant exchange of hostages and prisoners between Hamas and Israel. The agreement stipulates that Hamas will release all remaining living Israeli hostages, while Israel will free approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Following this exchange, negotiations are set to begin on the plan's later phases, which include the complete demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of a new transitional governing body. However, significant sticking points remain, such as the future role of Hamas and the extent of a long-term Israeli troop withdrawal.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has stated that Germany is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and is proposing to co-host a conference with Egypt on the region's reconstruction. Wadephul emphasized that any such conference must be politically broad, involving Israel, and should outline a political framework that keeps the possibility of a two-state solution in mind. This initiative is supported by Germany's ruling coalition, which views aiding Gaza's recovery as essential for regional stability and Israeli security. However, the proposal has faced some criticism from Israeli officials regarding the timing and format of international meetings.</p>
