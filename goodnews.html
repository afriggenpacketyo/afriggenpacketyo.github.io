          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a key driver of the nation's economy, faces uncertainty due to potential tariffs imposed by the United States. While President Trump paused the tariffs, the possibility of their reinstatement worries the millions of workers employed in the sector. The country relies on garment exports to fund essential imports, and tariffs could disrupt its economic growth. Despite recent political upheaval and economic challenges, Bangladesh has steadily grown since the 1980s, with its garment industry playing a crucial role in improving living standards.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to aid the entertainment industry after President Trump called for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal aims to strengthen domestic production and counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations with more attractive incentives. This comes after Trump met with Jon Voight, who suggested federal tax incentives and changes to the tax code. The industry seeks a balanced federal response to international competition, with unions and lawmakers advocating for tax credits rather than tariffs.</p>
