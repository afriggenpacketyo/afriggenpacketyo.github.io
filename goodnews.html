          <h2>Millennials' Hesitation Towards Parenthood Examined</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 10:55:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, noting that the U.S. fertility rate has fallen to a record low. The article suggests that this trend may result in millennials having the highest rate of childlessness of any generational cohort in American history. Explanations for this trend include the high cost of raising children, difficulty finding the right partner, career prioritization, concerns about climate change, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The author also posits that evolving definitions of harm and trauma, along with higher expectations for parental accountability, contribute to the pressure and perceived difficulty of parenting. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, now stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccines rather than issuing a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The new guidance emphasizes "shared clinical decision-making," meaning that vaccination decisions are informed by the clinical judgment of healthcare providers and the preferences of parents. The agency still recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and most adults. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>U.S. airlines are competing for international business-class dominance by offering enhanced amenities such as caviar, Bang & Olufsen headphones, and private suites with sliding doors. American Airlines plans to introduce upgraded business-class "suites" with features like a "trinket tray" and wireless charging pad, while United Airlines is creating a new "Polaris Studio" option with an ottoman and larger screens. These upgrades reflect a trend toward offering higher-tier seats within long-haul premium classes.

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former Sinn F√©in leader, has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages over a BBC story about the murder of a British agent. A court found that Adams was defamed in a BBC NI Spotlight program and accompanying online article, in which an anonymous contributor alleged he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson. Adams denies any involvement and stated that taking the case was about "putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation." The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder.
