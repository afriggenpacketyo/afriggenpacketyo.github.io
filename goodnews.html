        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Governor of the Bank of England has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market shows signs of a significant slowdown. While stating that the path for rates is "downward," the approach will remain "gradual and careful" as inflation is still above target. This potential policy shift comes as recent data shows a drop in job vacancies to its lowest level since 2021 and a contraction in the UK economy, prompting concerns about a possible recession.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy successfully avoided a technical recession by posting 1.4% growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a 0.5% contraction from the previous quarter. This growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, citing a lack of clarity over U.S. tariff policies and their potential impact on the global economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts and indicating a boost from a temporary tariff truce with the United States. This growth was supported by robust shipments to non-U.S. markets, particularly a 16.8% surge in exports to Southeast Asian nations, suggesting some trade diversion. The data also showed a notable 60% increase in rare earth shipments and strong performance in steel and automotive exports, though analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of this momentum given ongoing global trade uncertainties.

This legislative push, supported by the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration, has boosted investor confidence in the long-term stability and growth of the market. (not investment advice)</p>
