          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced that the government's revised winter fuel payment policy will be implemented this year, ensuring more individuals receive the allowance. While details regarding eligibility and specific changes will be clarified in the autumn Budget, the announcement addresses uncertainty following previous local election results. The payment, which can reach up to ¬£300, is designed to assist with energy costs during the winter months. Pensions Minister Torsten Bell stated that the policy would not revert to providing payments to all pensioners, emphasizing the goal of targeting those most in need.</p>

          <p>The Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands is exhibiting a nearly 200-year-old condom adorned with erotic art as part of a display on 19th-century sex work. The condom, believed to be made from a sheep's appendix around 1830, features an image of a nun and three clergymen. The phrase "This is my choice" is written along the sheath, referencing a painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The museum acquired the condom to highlight 19th-century sexuality and prostitution, emphasizing the era's concerns about unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History stumbled upon a new understanding of the Oort Cloud while preparing a planetarium show. During a preview of "Encounters in the Milky Way," a spiral shape was noticed in the Oort Cloud data, which was previously thought to be spherical or flattened. Further investigation confirmed the discovery, revealing a bar-like structure with waving arms within the inner Oort Cloud. This finding, published in The Astrophysical Journal, provides a new perspective on the outer solar system and could offer insights into the orbits of distant comets.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across England, focusing on mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. This move marks a shift from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East.

          <p>The UK has secured an exemption from the doubling of US tariffs on imported steel, a move welcomed by UK trade officials. However, the exemption is contingent on finalizing a trade deal by July 9; failure to do so would result in the UK's steel tariff rate increasing to 50%. While the UK government is working to finalize the deal, concerns have emerged about the potential for international steel to be diverted to the UK, undercutting domestic steelmakers. The UK agreed to cut tariffs on some US beef products and ethanol as part of the deal, creating challenges for the UK ethanol market.</p>

The research team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said their optical fibre network is theoretically scalable, showcasing the viability of this quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. While the transmission rate is currently too low for images, the achievement marks a significant step towards long-distance, large-scale quantum communication networks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have identified a neural mechanism that explains how experiences translate into emotions, involving a sustained signal in the brain. After a positive or negative event, this signal lingers, creating a broader emotional state. The team used air puffs to the cornea to study the brain activity associated with emotional responses in both mice and humans. They found two distinct phases: an initial sensory response followed by a sustained response in circuits linked to emotion, which was blocked by ketamine. The findings could help understand emotional differences in neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is scheduled to vote on regulations that would set zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors, and installers, beginning in 2027. The proposal aims to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, a key component of smog, but faces opposition from gas-appliance manufacturers and fossil fuel companies, who argue it will increase costs for consumers. The AQMD claims the plan is crucial for improving air quality and public health, with fees collected from gas-powered unit sales used to incentivize zero-emission appliance purchases.</p>

          <p>MSNBC's Jen Psaki humorously commented on President Donald Trump's unusual lack of public appearances over the past few days. Psaki alluded to Trump possibly being "low energy," referencing his past criticism of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign. Trump has been largely absent since a White House event with Elon Musk, with his social media activity also reduced. Trump's break from the public eye could end soon, as he has a "summer soiree" scheduled at the White House.</p>
