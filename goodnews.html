          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit, where a comprehensive Gaza peace plan is slated for signing. He is set to commend US President Donald Trump for his instrumental role in brokering the initial ceasefire and hostage return agreement between Israel and Hamas. Downing Street emphasized Britain's "key role behind the scenes" in diplomatic efforts, a claim that has drawn criticism from US Ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israel's deputy foreign minister. The summit, co-chaired by Trump and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to secure a lasting peace and stability in the Middle East after two years of intense conflict and bloodshed.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Luke Littler has clinched his inaugural World Grand Prix darts title, decisively beating world number one Luke Humphries 6-1 in Leicester. Having been eliminated in the first round of the unique 'double-in and double-out' tournament last year, Littler demonstrated remarkable improvement and ruthless precision throughout this campaign. His victory, securing the £120,000 prize money, marks his seventh PDC major televised title, placing him among the sport's elite. This win also significantly reduces the points gap between Littler and Humphries, intensifying their rivalry for the world number one ranking as they approach December's World Championships.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that Hamas might release the remaining 20 hostages "a little bit early," as he embarked on his trip to the Middle East. Speaking from Air Force One, Trump conveyed his astonishment at the successful efforts to secure the hostages' release, highlighting the challenging conditions of their captivity. His remarks precede a crucial Monday deadline for Hamas to return all remaining captives to Israel, an agreement stemming from a peace deal that concluded the two-year-long Israel-Hamas conflict. The president's visit underscores the ongoing diplomatic efforts and the anticipation surrounding the implementation of the peace agreement's initial phases.</p>

He underscored the paramount importance of cultivating indigenous talent to circumvent technological vulnerabilities, particularly amidst heightened competition with the United States. Yau acknowledged China's substantial progress in manufacturing, largely crediting its extensive and proficient labor pool for driving industrial success. His insights are timely as China develops its 15th five-year plan, which is designed to strategically address technological bottlenecks and bolster the nation's capacity to rival the US in critical scientific and technological sectors.</p>

          <p>India is strategically hedging its diplomatic bets by engaging in a renewed charm offensive with China, a significant development in a turbulent year. This approach was underscored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit, his first to China in seven years, where he and President Xi Jinping agreed to foster a partnership over rivalry. They committed to a mutually acceptable resolution of their border dispute and emphasized "strategic autonomy," avoiding external influences. This diplomatic pivot, which also includes the resumption of direct flights, signals India's intention to recalibrate its historically complex relationship with China. Both nations aim to strengthen a multipolar world order and enhance their collective influence within the Global South.</p>

          <p>Scotland's men's national football team has clarified its path to the 2026 World Cup finals, now guaranteed at least a top-two position in their qualification group. This means they will either secure an automatic spot in the finals or face the high-stakes play-offs in March. A recent victory against Belarus, coupled with Denmark's win over Greece, has left Scotland and Denmark level on points, though the Danes currently hold a superior goal difference. The ultimate qualification outcome will be determined by Scotland's upcoming away fixture against Greece and a potentially decisive home encounter against Denmark next month. Coach Steve Clarke's team is focused on achieving direct qualification.</p>

          <p>Diane Keaton, who recently passed away at the age of 79, is being celebrated as an enduring icon whose unique blend of vulnerability and fierce independence shaped her remarkable career. From a young age, Keaton was captivated by an unconventional definition of beauty, a quest that informed her distinctive style and memorable performances in films like "Annie Hall" and "The Godfather." Despite her widespread acclaim, she remained humble, often seeing herself as an "ordinary girl" whose stammering mannerisms surprisingly became her professional signature. A profound romantic, Keaton's life was characterized by deep connections, including significant relationships with Al Pacino and Woody Allen, and her unwavering commitment to her adopted children, embodying a spirit that prioritized authenticity over societal norms.</p>

The New York Jets endured a particularly dismal offensive performance, recording minus-10 net passing yards in a 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos, marking one of the worst passing outputs in modern NFL history. Meanwhile, the Carolina Panthers pulled off a significant upset, defeating the Dallas Cowboys 30-27, largely thanks to Rico Dowdle's impressive 200-plus scrimmage yards and a game-winning field goal at the buzzer. Other results saw the Los Angeles Rams triumph over the Baltimore Ravens, the Indianapolis Colts best the Arizona Cardinals, and the Seattle Seahawks overcome the Jacksonville Jaguars, among others, demonstrating a week of varied fortunes.</p>

The 60th annual World Conker Championships, held in Southwick, Northamptonshire, drew 256 competitors from nine countries, experiencing heightened scrutiny after last year's cheating scandal. Organizers responded by implementing stringent "airport-style" security checks, including scanners and magnets, to ensure fair play and prevent the use of illegal nuts; one man was disqualified for attempting to smuggle in his own conker. Cross, who had not expected to advance past the early rounds, attributed his surprising success to a combination of "force and accuracy" in the unpredictable game.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, formalizing the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two significant Islamic holidays, has ignited a public debate in Germany. Despite tabloid headlines suggesting "additional holidays" for Muslims, legal scholars and the Ministry of Education clarified that this agreement simply codifies a long-standing legal practice based on religious freedom, without creating new entitlements. This discussion mirrors broader national conversations about integration and cultural identity, particularly as Germany's public holiday structure, historically tied to Christian traditions, adapts to a more diverse populace. Similar allowances are already in place in other states for various religious communities, underscoring efforts towards fostering respectful coexistence within a multicultural society.</p>

All-rounder Rachin Ravindra also rejoins the squad after a facial injury had kept him out of the recent T20 series against Australia. While Williamson's absence is notable, he is anticipated to make his comeback for the subsequent three one-day internationals against England.
