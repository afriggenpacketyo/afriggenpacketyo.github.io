          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which allows users to create nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals using artificial intelligence. The Hong Kong-based company allegedly ran ads on Facebook and Instagram to promote the app, circumventing Meta's ad review process after repeated removals for violating platform rules. Meta aims to halt Joy Timeline from advertising on its services and is updating its enforcement methods with new technology to identify and remove such ads, even those without explicit nudity. The company is also sharing signals with other tech companies and disrupting networks of accounts promoting these services, underscoring its commitment to protecting its community from abuse. </p>

          <p>The Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota, and New York testified before a Republican-led House Oversight Committee to defend their states' immigration policies, amidst ongoing protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement. The governors criticized President Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, with Governor Hochul calling it an "overreach of epic proportions." House Republicans challenged the governors on instances of illegal immigrants committing crimes in their states, while the governors maintained that immigration is a federal responsibility. The hearing comes after Chair James Comer accused the states of obstructing federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree analyzes tipping rates and dining out spending across the United States, revealing significant variations among states. New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of their spending on food away from home, while Utah residents tip the least, at 4.09%. The study also finds that tipping rates are higher in states where people dine out more frequently, with Washington D.C. residents spending the most on dining out at $10,291 per capita in 2023. The analysis highlights the role of tipping in subsidizing service industry wages and the potential impact of proposed tax changes on tipped workers.</p>

          <p>Shemar Stewart, the Cincinnati Bengals' first-round draft pick, has left the team's mandatory minicamp due to an ongoing contract dispute. Stewart publicly addressed the issue, stating that he is not asking for anything the Bengals have not done before, but feels the team is prioritizing winning arguments over winning games. The dispute reportedly stems from the Bengals' attempt to change the way their first-round rookie contracts are structured, which would allow the team to void future guarantees. Head coach Zac Taylor acknowledged the situation, stating that the team is managing it and will be ready when Stewart joins the field.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian discusses the use of Mexican flags at protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, arguing that Republicans are using these images to incite fear and promote a narrative of an "invasion" of "illegal aliens". The author contends that the Mexican flag in the American context is not merely a nationalist symbol, but represents a connection to roots, a shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants, and a symbol of double-consciousness. The flag is seen as a bold articulation of solidarity and a challenge to the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to revise his "reciprocal" tariffs, particularly those imposed on the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico. Many believe that the 10% tariffs currently in effect will remain, rather than the higher rates initially proposed. This optimism stems from recent trade negotiations and court challenges, suggesting a potential softening of Trump's trade policies. However, some caution that this optimism may be premature, as the leverage of these countries is not the same as China's.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation data, with recent consumer and producer price readings remaining benign. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, the time lag for tariffs to affect the real economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists anticipate that the effects of tariffs may materialize in the coming months, but these factors have kept inflation in check so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are common ways to invest in a diversified basket of stocks or bonds and both can be actively or passively managed. ETFs are traded like individual stocks, and prices fluctuate during trading hours while mutual funds must be purchased and sold directly and are priced at the end of the market day. ETFs tend to have lower expense ratios than mutual funds because when investors buy mutual fund shares, there's more work that goes into managing the transaction, which leads to higher costs for the mutual fund company. It's important to consider fund costs since they can ultimately take a bite out of overall returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a unanimous decision making it easier for students with disabilities to sue schools for violating their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws. The ruling centered around Ava Tharpe, a teenage girl with a rare form of epilepsy, whose school in Minnesota refused to accommodate her late day schedule. The court lowered the burden for school children to meet when seeking to vindicate their rights in court.</p>
