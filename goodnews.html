          <p>Former President Joe Biden is easing back into public life, reflecting on the Democratic Party's losses and its future. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chose not to pursue a House Oversight Committee leadership position due to the party's emphasis on seniority, reigniting debates about generational change. This decision follows DNC Vice Chair David Hogg's plan to challenge older incumbents, a move criticized by veteran strategists. As Ocasio-Cortez's potential 2028 presidential ambitions circulate, the party grapples with rebranding and finding coherent platforms for the future.</p>
