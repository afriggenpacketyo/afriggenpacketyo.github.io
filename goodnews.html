          <p>S&P Global has announced that advertising technology firm AppLovin and stock trading platform Robinhood Markets will be added to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This inclusion typically boosts a company's stock value, as index-tracking funds are required to purchase shares to reflect the change. Both companies, which went public in 2021, saw their shares jump in extended trading following the news. The move signifies a major milestone for Robinhood, a favorite among retail investors, and AppLovin, whose software for targeted mobile ads has driven significant stock gains over the past few years.

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was unlawful. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively reinstates legal protections and work permits for these individuals unless the ruling is overturned on appeal. The judge criticized the administration's decision-making process as hasty and legally flawed, noting it was the first time in the program's 35-year history such a reversal had been attempted. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the ruling, vowing to explore all legal options to end what it calls an abused program.</p>

          <p>A Boy Scout troop from Santa Barbara is being hailed as heroes after rescuing a 78-year-old man who was lost and disoriented deep in the Emigrant Wilderness. The man, an experienced hiker, had lost his backpack containing all his survival gear and had spent a night exposed to the elements without food, water, or shelter. The troop's scoutmaster, trained in search and rescue, recognized the man's critical condition and used a satellite device to call for help. The scouts provided aid while awaiting a California Highway Patrol helicopter, which successfully airlifted the man to safety, providing a powerful real-world lesson for the troop on wilderness preparedness.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Giorgio Armani at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on his dual legacy as both a revolutionary fashion designer and a brilliant business leader. Armani built a multibillion-dollar empire by maintaining creative and financial control, famously rejecting mergers to remain his own boss. He pioneered the concept of the softly tailored "power suit" for both men and women, tapping into the cultural zeitgeist and redefining professional attire. His strategic use of celebrity endorsements, starting with dressing Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," was a novel marketing approach that elevated his brand to global icon status, ensuring his vision remained consistent across a diverse portfolio.</p>

          <h2>BBC Analysis Examines Crime Statistics in Chicago Amid Political Claims</h2>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of crime data in Chicago reveals a more complex picture than recent political rhetoric suggests. While President Trump has described the city as a "murder capital," FBI data shows that Chicago's overall violent crime rate fell by 11% in 2024 and was lower than that of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. Although Chicago recorded the highest total number of homicides of any U.S. city last year, its homicide rate per capita ranked tenth among large cities. Crime analysts caution against simple city-to-city rankings, as differing city boundaries and reporting methods can distort comparisons, but confirm a general downward trend in violent crime.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Barrett explained that she felt Jackson's "spirited argument" in a case concerning nationwide injunctions "merited a spirited response." She emphasized that their professional disagreements are confined to legal arguments on the page and do not affect their personal relationship, stating she has "great respect" for her colleague. Quoting her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett affirmed the principle of attacking ideas, not people, and described the Court as a place where vigorous debate coexists with collegiality and friendship.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies collectively added $420 billion in market capitalization this week, pushing their total value to an astounding $21 trillion. A significant catalyst was a favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case, which limited the remedies against the company and sent shares of both Alphabet and Apple soaring. Separately, Broadcom's stock surged after it secured a new $10 billion AI chip contract, widely believed to be with OpenAI. These gains have increased the concentration of these eight mega-cap companies to an unprecedented 36% of the entire S&P 500 index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock jumped over 9% after the company announced it had secured a new $10 billion contract for custom artificial intelligence chips with a fourth major customer.

This massive order significantly boosts Broadcom's AI revenue forecast and solidifies its position as a key player alongside Nvidia in the booming AI hardware market. The company's existing major AI clients are believed to be Google, Meta, and ByteDance, making this new partnership a major expansion of its high-profile customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign, a landmark for travelers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport for 25 years, is being temporarily taken down. The removal is necessary to accommodate a major roadway reconfiguration project aimed at improving traffic flow and accessibility ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympics. The project will create more direct routes to parking and is expected to significantly reduce congestion on Sepulveda Boulevard. The iconic letters will be stored safely and reinstalled in a new location compatible with the updated road design upon the project's completion, though a specific timeline for its return has not been set.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its largest single-day decline in over a year, falling to 6.29% after the release of a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This drop brings rates to their lowest level since October of the previous year, providing some relief to potential homebuyers facing high prices. The market's reaction reflects growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to bolster the economy. While the lower rates reduce monthly payments, housing experts question whether this will be enough to reinvigorate a housing market that has been sluggish due to persistent affordability challenges.
