        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of escalating aerial attacks, involving two 12-hour periods starting with Iran. The agreement was made after the U.S. joined Israel's war by launching strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, which followed Israel's initial strikes on Iran's nuclear program. In the final hours before the ceasefire, Iran launched missiles, reportedly killing at least three people in Israel. Prior to Trump's announcement, Iran's foreign minister denied any ceasefire agreement but stated they would halt strikes if Israel did the same. The article highlights the delicate balance and uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire's durability. The situation remains tense despite the declared agreement.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which they say represents a significant advancement in using light for simultaneous operations. The chip has a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development is particularly relevant as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. The article highlights the importance of optical computing in overcoming the limitations of electronic chips, particularly in the context of AI and data centers.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, which raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant drops, falling below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, and the article notes that some believe Trump successfully escalated to de-escalate the situation. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for peace.</p>
