          <p>Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has stated that a permanent Chinese military presence is not welcome in the South Pacific, emphasizing the region should be an "ocean of peace." Speaking in Australia, Rabuka asserted that Fiji would not welcome such a development and that superpower rivalries should not be played out in the area. This statement comes amid China's increasing diplomatic and financial influence across the Pacific, which has included security pacts and significant infrastructure investments in neighboring island nations.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed on social media that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and urged Hamas to accept the proposal. The claim has not been officially confirmed by Israel, although the country's foreign minister noted there was majority government support for a framework to release hostages. A Hamas official stated the group is prepared to agree if the deal leads to a complete end to the war, as diplomatic efforts continue.</p>

          <p>A veterinarian in Spooner, Wisconsin, successfully treated a bald eagle with a severely infected leg injury by using a pioneering skin graft procedure involving sterilized Atlantic cod skin. Dr. Kimberly Ammann used the technique, more commonly applied to human wounds, to save the eagle, named Kere, who she initially thought would need to be euthanized. After a ten-month rehabilitation, the eagle was released back into the wild in a symbolic event just before the Fourth of July holiday, celebrating the freedom of the national bird.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is successfully integrating his climate agenda with his central message of affordability. Instead of abstract policies, his platform focuses on tangible benefits like a rent freeze, which prevents landlords from passing on green upgrade costs, and free, faster bus service to reduce car use and transportation costs. Supporters argue this approach of tying environmental goals to immediate quality-of-life improvements is key to building a broad, durable political coalition for climate action.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is offering two free fishing days this summer, on July 5 and August 30. On these Saturdays, anyone can fish in the state's public waters without needing to purchase a sport fishing license. The initiative is designed to provide a low-cost opportunity for new anglers to try the sport. While the license requirement is waived, all other fishing regulations, such as bag limits, size restrictions, and report card requirements for certain species, will remain in effect.</p>

          <p>A new law in California, which went into effect Tuesday, now requires bars, nightclubs, and other establishments serving alcohol to provide drink lids to customers upon request. The measure, Assembly Bill 2375, is intended as a tool to help patrons protect themselves from having their drinks drugged. This law complements a previous bill that mandated signage informing customers about the availability of drug-testing kits, with both measures aimed at increasing safety in nightlife environments.</p>
