          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," delves into the artistic decisions made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in creating the 1992 film "Malcolm X." The article details the extensive efforts to recreate historical settings, including Roxbury and the Audubon Ballroom, for pivotal scenes in Malcolm X's life. It also highlights Lee's inclusion of cameo appearances by figures who interacted with Malcolm X, such as Bobby Seale and Reverend Al Sharpton. The excerpt further describes the psychological challenge Lee faced in portraying Malcolm's premonition of his own death and the artistic techniques used to convey this sense of fatalism.</p>

Health care and transportation were among the sectors that saw job gains, while the federal government reported a slight loss of jobs amid efforts to trim payrolls in the public sector.
