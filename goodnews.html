        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent sales slowdown for Chinese EV giant BYD, China is strategically engineering Asia's rise as the world's primary electric vehicle factory through integration and investment. Unlike Western protectionist policies, Chinese corporations are establishing factories and joint ventures across Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia and Thailand, to build a resilient, interconnected supply chain. A key example is CATL's $6 billion project in Indonesia to create a complete battery ecosystem, from nickel mining to recycling. This collaborative approach leverages regional raw materials and Chinese technology, fostering a symbiotic economic environment rather than a competitive one.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis details the diplomatic factors that contributed to the recent Israel-Hamas peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration, a breakthrough that had eluded his predecessor. The report suggests that a combination of President Trump's close but firm relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, strong ties with Gulf states, and a pivotal Israeli air strike in Qatar created the conditions for the deal. This approach, which involved leveraging personal relationships and responding to shifting regional dynamics, ultimately brought both sides to the negotiating table to secure the release of hostages. The agreement marks a significant, albeit initial, step toward resolving the two-year conflict.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits and raised its full-year outlook, successfully navigating higher tariff costs through targeted price increases and a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. The company's gross margin expanded as it reduced discounts and sold more products through its own stores and website, which yield higher profits than wholesale channels. CEO Michelle Gass confirmed that the price hikes have not negatively impacted consumer demand, allowing the denim maker to confidently project continued growth despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant breakthrough in the Middle East, confirming an agreement between Israel and Hamas to implement the first phase of a new peace plan. Speaking from the White House, Trump stated that all remaining Israeli hostages are expected to be released early next week, marking a pivotal moment in the two-year conflict. While celebrating the deal as a step toward "everlasting peace," he provided few specifics on subsequent phases, such as the disarmament of Hamas or the future governance of Gaza. The initial phase includes an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops.</p>

          <p>California physicist and UC Santa Barbara professor John Martinis has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in physics for his pioneering experiments in the 1980s that laid the groundwork for quantum computing. His work, conducted alongside fellow laureates John Clarke and Michel Devoret, proved that quantum tunneling was possible with large objects, a concept that became fundamental to the field. Martinis later led a team at Google that, in 2019, created a quantum processor that outperformed the fastest supercomputers. Now leading his own company, Martinis continues to advance the technology, emphasizing the need for accelerated research and development.</p>

          <p>President Trump has met with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to again discuss his potential nomination to lead NASA, months after the president publicly withdrew his initial nomination. Trump had previously pulled the nomination citing Isaacman's past political donations and close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, with whom Trump was feuding. With tensions between Musk and Trump having since cooled, Isaacman, a seasoned space traveler and founder of Shift4, appears to be back in consideration for the top job at the space agency. The potential appointment comes as NASA faces significant budget cuts and staffing reductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new sequel, "Tron: Ares," reverses the franchise's premise by bringing digital programs into the human world, but its exploration of artificial intelligence themes is more confusing than compelling. The film centers on Ares (Jared Leto), an AI soldier who begins to develop sentience and empathy, questioning his mission in a narrative that heavily borrows from Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein." Despite a stylish aesthetic reminiscent of "Tron: Legacy" and a soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails, the movie suffers from a script that over-explains its themes, leaving little room for nuance. The result is a visually interesting but ultimately shallow film that fails to innovate on its predecessors.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the adjusted federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year to account for inflation. This annual adjustment helps prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income hasn't increased. For 2026, the standard deduction will rise to $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. These changes, combined with the permanent extension of tax cuts from the 2017 law, are expected to provide financial relief for many American taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

The record features samples from George Michael's "Freedom! '90" and U2's "Numb," which were used to unlock new creative directions for the songs.

          <p>D.J. Waldie, a celebrated author known for his evocative writing about Los Angeles, argues that residents must develop a deep, informed love for the city to address its complex challenges. In a recent interview, Waldie explained that his work aims to move beyond clichés and connect Angelenos to the city's true history, which he believes is essential for making better political decisions about housing, politics, and community. He contends that without this "affective history"—a history that makes you feel something—people remain indifferent to the forces threatening the city. For Waldie, falling in love with the imperfect reality of Los Angeles is the first step toward building its future.</p>

Krasznahorkai's writing, including his acclaimed novel "The Melancholy of Resistance," often reflects the oppressive atmosphere of Cold War-era Hungary but transcends its specific historical context to resonate universally.
