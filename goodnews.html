          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by using the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of U.S. legislation.

          <p>On Memorial Day, it is essential to remember the principles for which soldiers fought and died, especially the preservation of democracy. Frederick Douglass emphasized the importance of honoring the Union dead not just for their bravery but for their fight against slavery and for the hope of freedom. As democracy faces threats worldwide, it is crucial to uphold the legacy of those who risked their lives to defend government of the people, by the people, for the people.</p>
