          <p>Amazon is reorganizing its health-care business into six new units after a series of executive departures, aiming to simplify its structure and accelerate innovation. The company has been trying to establish itself in the U.S. health-care market for a decade, with both successes and setbacks including the closure of Amazon Care in 2022. The reorganization involves tapping longtime Amazon leaders and elevating One Medical executives to oversee the divisions. Amazon Health Services will now focus on clinical care delivery, operations, strategic growth, store tech and marketing, compliance, and pharmacy services, with the goal of improving the fragmented patient experience.</p>

          <p>Two men have been sentenced for stealing a ¬£4.8m gold toilet from an art exhibition at Blenheim Palace in September 2019. James Sheen pleaded guilty to burglary and related charges, while Michael Jones was found guilty of burglary. Sheen, a career criminal, was sentenced to four years, and Jones received two years and three months; the judge described the heist as "bold and brazen." Sheen sold part of the gold for ¬£520,000 and used coded language in messages related to the sale.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Lowering Credit Card Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 12:20:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers can lower credit card interest rates without opening new accounts by directly asking card issuers for a lower rate, especially with a good payment history. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can lead to lower rates across multiple cards, though accounts may need to be closed. Temporary hardship programs offered by card companies can provide reduced APRs or deferred payments during financial difficulties. An improved credit score and mentioning competitive offers can also strengthen a request for a rate reduction.</p>

          <p>Shares of RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, increased after the company maintained its sales forecast and outlined strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. The luxury furniture retailer expects full-year revenue to grow by 10% to 13%. To counter tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China and delaying the launch of a new concept until spring 2026. The company plans to open stores in other countries, including a location on Paris' Champs √âlys√©es.</p>

          <p>Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK, causing hay fever symptoms for many. Warm weather conditions have been ideal for birch tree pollen, a major hay fever trigger. Allergy experts recommend a "cocktail approach" of antihistamine tablets or drops, a steroid nasal spray, and eye drops. Other measures to reduce symptoms include showering after being outside, vacuuming regularly, and avoiding triggers like cut grass and drying clothes outside.</p>

          <p>The IPO market is showing signs of revival, with several successful public debuts in June, including Chime, Voyager Technologies, and Circle. This positive trend is expected to embolden more companies to go public, potentially benefiting investment banking divisions within Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. While geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainties remain risks, experts believe the IPO market will be stronger in 2025 than in 2024. Increased dealmaking activity is also expected to boost revenues for these banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Navigating life transitions can be challenging, whether driven by joyful milestones or unwanted changes, and books can offer valuable guidance. Alexander Chee's 'How to Write an Autobiographical Novel' emphasizes self-discovery and reinvention, while Gary Zukav's 'The Seat of the Soul' focuses on taking control of one's life through intention and consequences. Jennifer Egan's 'A Visit From the Goon Squad' offers hope that mistakes don't define us, and Alex Haley and Malcolm X's 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' inspires personal and political awakening.</p>

          <p>Simone Biles apologized for personal remarks made about Riley Gaines during an online exchange about transgender athlete participation in sports. Biles initially called Gaines "truly sick" and a "sore loser" after Gaines misgendered a transgender softball player. Biles clarified that her frustration was directed at the system and that singling out an underage player was inappropriate. The apology followed backlash from conservative media figures, despite Biles standing by her broader point about inclusion and fairness in sports.</p>
