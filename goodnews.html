The crew, consisting of two US astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, completed an 18-hour journey home. During their 146 days in orbit, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including studies on plant growth and cellular behavior in microgravity.

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has revealed that discovering he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease prompted a major shift in his life's focus. The "Thor" star learned he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene during the filming of his show "Limitless," increasing his likelihood of developing the brain disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth described the news as a catalyst for deeper self-reflection, moving his motivations away from simple collection towards contribution and purpose. This change in mindset is a central theme in the show's second season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is seeing a boom as people spend on small luxuries and significant experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon expands on the "lipstick effect," where consumers purchase modest items like makeup, but also includes larger splurges like concert tickets, even while cutting back on daily essentials. Analysts note this shift is driven by a desire for guilt-free joy and the changing nature of life milestones, which are becoming less attainable for younger generations. This trend is expected to persist for several years, reflecting ongoing economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Sanders' performance comes after a controversial start to his professional career, which saw him fall to the 144th pick in the draft amid character concerns and later receive two speeding citations. Despite initial doubts from team ownership and criticism from the general manager, his successful debut has shifted the narrative, making him a major topic of conversation around the league.

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that safely guided his crew back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion, turning a potential disaster into a "successful failure." He was also a crew member on Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the moon, where he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." Remembered for his courage and imagination, Lovell's legacy is immortalized in space history.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Cordoba, Spain, have successfully extinguished a blaze that broke out in the city's historic Mosque-Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The fire reportedly started in one of the chapels, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper. The mayor praised the "rapid and magnificent intervention" of the fire crews, stating that their swift action averted a potential catastrophe for the treasured monument. The building, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was later converted into a Christian cathedral, suffered no major structural damage.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the company overcharged customers in its California stores. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed that Walmart sold items, particularly those priced by weight like produce and baked goods, for more than their advertised or correct price. This practice was alleged to be a violation of the state's false advertising and unfair competition laws. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California locations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent settlement between Disney and actress Gina Carano, who was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. The author argues that while it's tempting to view the settlement as another instance of corporate capitulation to political pressure, it was actually the right thing to do. The piece suggests Disney's initial firing was an overreaction and a form of pandering to a social media mob. The settlement is positioned not as a loss in the "cancel culture" wars, but as a necessary correction for an extreme response.</p>

          <p>An unexpected friendship has formed between US Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their stark political differences. Vance is currently on a personal holiday in the UK, which began with a stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and their time at prestigious US universities. This personal relationship is seen as potentially important for UK-US relations under the Trump administration, which has often personalized international diplomacy, even as the two politicians have previously made unflattering comments about Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>A viral claim originating on Facebook, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island at least 37 times has been found to have no evidence. The fact-check highlights that Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making it impossible for a plane of that size to land there; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. Furthermore, the Facebook user who made the claim appeared to be wearing a pilot costume from an online retailer in his profile picture. The article concludes the claim is unsubstantiated.</p>

The H20 chip was specifically tailored by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's AI and defense development.
