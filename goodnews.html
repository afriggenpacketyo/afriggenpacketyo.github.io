          <p>This article recounts the harrowing experience of Michelle Renee, a California bank manager who, along with her daughter, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to Michelle, her daughter, and her roommate, and threatened to detonate it if she didn't comply with their demands. After successfully robbing the bank and returning home, Michelle and her daughter were freed, and the authorities were alerted. The subsequent investigation revealed a web of lies and deceit, with one of the kidnappers falsely claiming that Michelle was in on the plot. Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, Michelle faced intense scrutiny and was treated like a criminal during the trial of her kidnappers, but she was ultimately vindicated when the true mastermind confessed decades later.</p>

          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, many hospitals in Japan continue to enforce strict visitation policies, causing distress for patients and their families. A group of physicians and social workers are now advocating for the abolishment or reduction of these restrictions, arguing they infringe on human rights. One doctor recounts his family's struggle to visit his cancer-stricken mother-in-law, highlighting the inconsistencies and lack of scientific basis for the policies. While the health ministry has recommended considering visitation opportunities, the decision remains with individual facilities, prompting concerns that policies may revert to strict measures based on infection rates.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road, a scenic section of Highway 120, will reopen to all traffic on Memorial Day, marking the park's eastern entrance accessible after its closure due to winter conditions.

Visitors planning to enter Yosemite during peak hours over the holiday weekend will require reservations, and limited services are expected along Tioga Road.

          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports suggests that a dog owner's work-related stress can transfer to their canine companions. Researchers found that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work issues at home are more likely to have dogs exhibiting stress-related behaviors. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," highlights dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and potential changes in care routines. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pet's well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home, as dogs can pick up on human feelings through subtle cues and changes in behavior.</p>

The article explores the troubled relationship between Jason and Molly, including Molly's desire to adopt Jason's children and Jason's plans to move back to Ireland without her. The case took several twists and turns, but ultimately the convictions stood and Lynch's brother's reputation was restored.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions, increasing their annual salaries to over 6 million yen due to rising competition for talent. The new scheme, set to begin in January, will also allow chefs to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of serving as live-in staff. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the "significant roles" chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, aiming to fill current vacancies in approximately a dozen of the country's 230 overseas missions.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author, journalist, and activist known for her book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape," has died at the age of 90. Her book, published in 1975, reframed sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, leading to changes in laws and societal attitudes. While the book was widely praised, it also drew criticism for its feminist ideology and assertions about the role of men. Brownmiller remained a vocal advocate against pornography and taught at Pace University until her 80s.</p>
