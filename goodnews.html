        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza soon, as Hamas has agreed to parts of President Trump's peace plan. Netanyahu sent a delegation to Egypt to finalize technical details, aiming to resolve the negotiations quickly. While signaling there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas agreed to release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The United States views Hamas' response as positive, though decommissioning of weapons remains a point of discussion, as the focus shifts to implementing the first phase of Trump's plan for the hostages' release. The Israeli military is preparing for this implementation, though tactical improvements will still be made to protect soldiers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that a peace deal in Gaza is "very close," despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes. He intends to finalize a deal between Israel and Hamas soon, referencing a 20-point plan unveiled this week. Trump recounted a conversation with the Israeli prime minister, emphasizing the need for agreement. While Israel has reportedly halted its campaign in Gaza City, airstrikes have continued, according to Gaza's civil defence agency. The White House plan proposes a ceasefire, hostage exchange, Israeli withdrawal, Hamas disarmament, and a transitional government.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Hamas to "move quickly" on the Gaza peace plan, as U.S. negotiators head to Cairo to facilitate an end to the two-year conflict. He warned against delay, stating "all bets will be off" if an agreement is not reached promptly. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hopes for the return of all remaining hostages by a specific date, as Israel's bombing of Gaza City has reportedly subsided. The White House unveiled a 20-point peace plan, and Trump ordered Israel to halt bombing to allow Hamas to release hostages.</p>

          <p>Piano sales are dropping, but the instrument continues to find its way into people's homes through digital alternatives. The shift reflects changing consumer preferences and economic factors, with millennials struggling to afford traditional pianos. Digital pianos offer a smaller, more affordable option, with accurate sounds and functional keys. Some believe this new generation learning on digital pianos isn't a bad thing, as they still allow for musicality and emotional expression. There is optimism that as people grow weary of screens, there may be a resurgence of piano playing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a warning to Hamas, stating it must move quickly to release hostages "or else all bets will be off" as the Israeli bombardment on Gaza is scaled back. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling to Egypt to finalize details of a Gaza peace deal. A senior Israeli official said the halt in IDF activity in Gaza is intended to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed Hamas' positive statements and Trump's efforts to end the war.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is installing the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a landmark moment for the denomination. Curry succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, who served for 12 years and was the first woman to lead the ELCA. As the leader of the largest American Lutheran Church body, Curry will face challenges common to other mainline Protestant denominations, which in recent years have weathered theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion and precipitous membership declines. Curry was one of 65 synodal, or regional, bishops.</p>

          <p>Democrats are countering Republican claims that they are trying to pass a resolution providing “free healthcare for illegals”. Republicans have used this claim to fuel the government shutdown. Democrats assert that no federal dollars go to providing health insurance for undocumented immigrants. The funding patch seeks to reverse cuts to Medicaid and allow lawfully present noncitizens to enroll in certain federal health care programs. Democrats also aim to extend ACA premium tax credits, which are set to expire.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy at roughly half the usual cost to its members with a prescription. Members can purchase a four-week supply for $499, though this offer is exclusive to those paying out of pocket. This move comes as GLP-1 drug prices have surged, and supply is increasingly limited. The goal is to provide access to authentic medications amidst the rise of cheaper, compounded versions. This could further boost access and demand, particularly as many health plans continue to deny coverage for these drugs.</p>
