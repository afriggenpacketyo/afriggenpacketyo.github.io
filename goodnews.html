          <h2>Oxford Professor Argues Globalisation is Thriving, Particularly in Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 18:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead flourishing in Asia. He credits this phenomenon for the region's significant economic growth and poverty reduction, noting that Asia's success is a direct result of its integration into the global economy. Goldin observes a trend towards a more fragmented and regionalised globalisation, with Asia becoming a central hub as the U.S. shows signs of withdrawal. The article also touches upon the dual nature of globalisation, which brings both benefits like trade and risks like pandemics.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title and sixth career Grand Slam by defeating defending champion Jannik Sinner in a four-set final. The victory allows the 22-year-old to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Sinner. This match was the third major final between the two rivals in the same calendar year, with Alcaraz now leading their head-to-head series. The event was briefly overshadowed by security delays due to the attendance of U.S. President Donald Trump, which pushed back the start time.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government is set to launch a new Defence Industrial Strategy, supported by £250 million in funding, to foster regional economic growth and create jobs in the defence sector. The initiative includes five new Defence Growth Deals targeting specific regions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland for development in areas like marine autonomy, advanced materials, and cyber security. The government anticipates that this long-term investment could generate up to 50,000 new skilled jobs by 2035. This strategy also aims to enhance the UK's industrial capacity in response to evolving global security threats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant revival, with tourism and business travel returning to pre-pandemic levels. The city's unique position under the "one country, two systems" framework is seen as a benefit, allowing it to host international events like a major Bitcoin conference that would be unlikely in mainland China. The piece points to a booming IPO market, which raised seven times more funds in the first half of the year compared to the previous year, as a key indicator of economic vitality. The author suggests Beijing should further support this by encouraging international engagement.</p>

          <p>Coastal California is set to experience a significant drop in temperatures, with forecasts predicting weather 5 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of year. An upper-level low-pressure system is bringing cooler air, thick marine fog, and the possibility of light showers to regions from the Bay Area down to Los Angeles. This comes as a disappointment to Bay Area residents who endured an unusually cold summer, while Southern California gets a break from recent heat waves. The cool coastal weather contrasts with monsoonal conditions in some inland areas that have seen lightning storms.</p>

          <p>England's national football team manager, Thomas Tuchel, has indicated a desire to incorporate more direct tactics, such as long throw-ins and long balls, into the team's strategy for the upcoming World Cup.

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, emphasized that the central bank's monetary policy must be "fully independent of political influence." His statement comes after President Trump has repeatedly pressured the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates. Hassett warned that historical examples show that when political leaders control central banks, it often leads to inflation and economic hardship for consumers. He also voiced agreement with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's call for a widespread review of the Federal Reserve's mission and structure. (not investment advice)</p>
