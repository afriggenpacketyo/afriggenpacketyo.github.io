          <p>China's offshore yuan has experienced a significant jump, reaching a six-month high, driven by growing optimism that the US and China may be moving towards de-escalating trade tensions. This shift in market sentiment follows indications that the two countries may begin negotiating a rollback of tariffs. However, analysts caution that any negotiations are likely to be protracted and uncertain, potentially leading to volatility in the exchange rate. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and are awaiting tangible signs of China's ability to withstand US challenges.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists are asserting that their country's earliest star catalogue, known as ‚ÄúShi‚Äôs Star Catalogue,‚Äù is the world‚Äôs oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. Researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming observations around 335BC. If confirmed, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, which has been recognized as the oldest. Experts believe that both Chinese and Greek astronomers began detailed studies of the night sky around the same time.</p>
