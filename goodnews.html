          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a long-standing dispute between the two countries. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to representatives of the temple in South Korea after South Korean authorities arrested thieves and confiscated the statue. Buseoksa Temple in South Korea filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023, leading to the completion of return procedures in January.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, including English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad, to control immigration levels. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasizes that new immigrants must earn the right to stay, viewing settlement as a privilege rather than an automatic right. The government aims to seize the narrative from Reform UK, a party gaining traction by criticizing current immigration policies. The new measures also include prioritizing residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer in the community, while increasing the waiting period for citizenship to ten years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traders have rebranded over $1 billion of Venezuelan oil shipments to China as Brazilian crude over the past year to circumvent US sanctions and reduce logistics costs. This practice allows tankers to sail directly from Venezuela to China, avoiding stops in Malaysia, which has traditionally been a trans-shipment hub. Shippers are also tampering with tankers' location signals to make it appear as though vessels are departing from Brazilian ports when they are actually sailing from Venezuela, a practice known as spoofing. Chinese customs data indicates significant imports of mixed bitumen from Brazil, a product Brazil rarely exports, further supporting the claim of rebranded Venezuelan oil.</p>

The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, have raised hopes for a reduction in trade barriers and a more stable global economy. A joint statement with full details is expected, potentially including cuts to tariffs that have caused turmoil in financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

Despite promises to reduce net migration to the levels of the 1990s, successive governments have failed to meet this target. Brexit, intended to grant the UK greater control over its borders, has not resulted in a decrease in net migration figures. Recent data indicates a slight decline in net migration, but the numbers remain historically high, underscoring the complexity of managing immigration policies effectively.</p>
