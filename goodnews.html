          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, marking a significant shift in federal nutrition policy. This decision reverses two decades of rejections from the federal government, which had previously hesitated to cross corporate interests and anti-poverty groups. The Nebraska program, set to begin in January 2026, will affect around 150,000 food stamp recipients and aims to evaluate changes in their spending habits while providing technical assistance to retailers for the transition. This move could pave the way for similar waivers in other states, sparking debate among health advocates, trade groups, and anti-hunger organizations regarding its impact on healthier choices and potential cuts to SNAP.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corporation announced that the 2026 Toyota RAV4 will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. This decision reflects the growing popularity and customer demand for hybrid vehicles, aligning with Toyota's long-standing advocacy for hybrid technology. Despite slower adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers are increasingly turning to hybrids to meet fuel economy regulations and enhance performance. Toyota's electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of its domestic sales in 2024, with RAV4 sales increasing by 9.3%, driven by a surge in hybrid and plug-in hybrid models.</p>

          <p>Scientists are predicting an eruption of the Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the Oregon coast, possibly later this year. The volcano, situated more than 4,900 feet beneath the Pacific Ocean, is showing signs of an impending eruption for the first time since 2015. While the eruption poses no danger to people on land, it will be marked by a sharp increase in earthquakes around the volcano. The eruption is a result of a hot spot in the Earth's mantle, a process responsible for forming over two-thirds of the Earth's surface.</p>

          <p>A review commissioned by the Department for Education in England urges universities to enhance efforts to prevent student suicides. The report, examining 169 cases of suicide and serious self-harm, recommends universities conduct safety checks of student halls, discourage tributes in areas where deaths occurred, and improve support for struggling students. Families should be more involved in investigation processes. While some students report feeling supported by university staff, the review highlights the need for better access to mental health services, especially for international students. The review follows increasing financial pressures on universities and calls for a legal duty of care to students.</p>

          <p>The FDA has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups, such as seniors and those with underlying conditions, but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., criticized the "one-size-fits-all regulatory framework" used in the past.

          <p>The NFL is considering a proposal to ban the "tush push" play, a controversial short-yardage tactic popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The proposal cites player safety and pace of play as reasons for the ban, although data does not support the safety concerns. The play involves the quarterback being pushed forward by teammates from behind to gain extra yardage. Some argue that the play is a "cheapo play" akin to a scrum in rugby, while others defend it as a legitimate football strategy.</p>
