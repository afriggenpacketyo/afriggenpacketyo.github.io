          <p>Renowned celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has publicly shared that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer, specifically a Basal cell carcinoma that has since been removed. In a social media post, the 58-year-old chef displayed a bandage on the side of his face and neck, humorously noting it was not the result of a facelift. He thanked his medical team for their swift action and used the opportunity to urge his followers to be vigilant about sun protection, reminding everyone to use sunscreen, especially over the weekend.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Gen Z individuals are pursuing careers in skilled trades like HVAC installation, plumbing, and welding, driven by concerns that artificial intelligence may render many white-collar jobs obsolete. Enrollment in trade schools and vocational programs has surged, as these fields offer job security and competitive wages without the significant student debt associated with a four-year university degree. Career experts note this "AI-xiety pivot" reflects a shift in perception, where tangible skills are seen as more stable and reliable in a rapidly changing labor market, as AI cannot perform physical tasks like installing an air conditioner.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly increased its bid for Crystal Palace's captain, Marc Guehi, to £35 million, now including a 10% sell-on clause for the defender. Talks between the two football clubs are ongoing as the transfer deadline approaches, with Palace seeking an additional £5 million in performance-related bonuses to finalize the deal. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, compelling Palace to consider a sale to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. The club is actively trying to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's move to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, Hamburg's Astra St. Pauli Brewery has partnered with the condiment company Hela to create a limited-edition beer called "Currydurst," which translates to "Currythirst." This new beverage infuses the flavor of Hela's iconic spiced curry ketchup, a staple condiment for Germany's popular Currywurst sausage, into a classic Astra beer. The creation is a tribute to Hamburg's street food culture, combining the city's cult-classic beer with the familiar spicy and smoky taste of the ketchup. Only 2,000 liters of this unconventional brew will be produced, making it a rare novelty for local enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>Health officials in New York City have declared that the recent Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is officially over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven fatalities. An investigation traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <h2>AI-Powered Stethoscope Shows Promise in Rapid Detection of Heart Conditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in a matter of seconds. The device uses a sophisticated microphone to analyze subtle heartbeat sounds imperceptible to the human ear and sends the data to an AI system for analysis. A large-scale study involving over 200 GP surgeries found that the AI stethoscope significantly improved detection rates for these conditions. This innovation is being hailed as a potential "game-changer" that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients across the UK.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" offers a well-made and entertaining, if less gritty, tribute to the Troma original. Starring Peter Dinklage as the mutated hero Winston Goose, the film reimagines the story with an environmentalist bent, pitting the janitor-turned-vigilante against a villainous pharmaceutical CEO played by Kevin Bacon. Director Macon Blair infuses the story with gory violence and goofy humor but anchors it with an unexpected emotional sincerity. While enjoyable for a broader audience, the film's polished production may lack the transgressive, low-budget charm that defined the original's cult status.</p>

          <p>A recent performance at the Hollywood Bowl titled "Sarabande Africaine" featured a unique collaboration between Afropop star Angélique Kidjo and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, exploring the African origins of Baroque dance forms. The concert showcased how the rhythmic patterns of dances carried by enslaved Africans to 16th-century Spain influenced composers like Bach and Handel. Kidjo transformed classics like Gershwin's "Summertime" and Ravel's "Bolero" with African languages and rhythms, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, background. The show was a vibrant demonstration of cross-cultural musical fusion, highlighting shared histories and celebrating artistic connection.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on Social Security survivor benefits for individuals whose spouses have passed away, clarifying that one cannot collect both their own full retirement benefits and their deceased spouse's benefits simultaneously. It outlines the eligibility criteria for survivor benefits, which generally require the surviving spouse to be at least 60 years old, or 50 if disabled. The Social Security Administration will pay out the higher of the two benefit amounts. The article also discusses strategies, such as starting with survivor benefits and later switching to one's own retirement benefit if it becomes larger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to $1 billion after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner, marking the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. Winners face a choice between receiving the full amount as an annuity over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half that value. Regardless of the choice, all winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%. State taxes also apply in most jurisdictions, though eight states, including Florida, Texas, and California, do not tax lottery winnings.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have uncovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, due to receding water levels at the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought plaguing the country for five consecutive years has exposed archaeological sites that were previously submerged. The tombs, dating back to the Hellenistic period, were found in the Khanke region of Duhok province. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for excavation, and researchers are working to transfer the artifacts to a museum before water levels rise again.</p>
