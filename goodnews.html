          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors. Lawyers for the children, aged 10 to 17, argued that the administration was attempting to repatriate over 600 minors in violation of laws that grant them the right to challenge their removal. The legal action was filed amid concerns that the children, many of whom are indigenous and speak languages other than Spanish or English, could face danger if returned. The emergency hearing was moved up after the court learned the children were already in the process of being removed.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers convened for informal talks to brainstorm future support for Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. Key ideas discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms on EU soil. The ministers also debated the controversial seizure of frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv, a move some member states fear could be illegal and deter future investment. Additionally, proposals were floated to shift EU military training onto Ukrainian soil post-ceasefire and to implement comprehensive tariffs on Russian goods.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to provide the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates between the two nations. The agreement was hailed as a major victory for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by culling millions of purple sea urchins. Over the past 13 years, divers led by The Bay Foundation have smashed over 5.8 million urchins across 80 acres, clearing the way for the vital kelp forests to regrow. These "sequoias of the sea" had declined by 80% due to an ecological imbalance caused by pollution, warming waters, and the proliferation of urchins. The successful restoration has not only brought back the kelp but also improved the habitat for over 800 marine species and benefited local fisheries.</p>

          <p>The Powerball grand prize has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest jackpot in the game's history. The prize grew after no tickets matched all six winning numbers in Saturday night's drawing for the $1 billion prize. While there was no jackpot winner, nine tickets did match all five white balls to win $1 million each, and another three tickets won $2 million by utilizing the "power play" option. The next drawing is scheduled for Monday night, with a potential winner facing a choice between the full annuity or a lump sum cash value of $498.4 million.</p>

          <p>Slovenian basketball star Luka Dončić delivered a historic performance, recording only the fourth triple-double in EuroBasket history since 1995. He led his team to an 86-69 victory over Belgium with 26 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds. This crucial win was Slovenia's first of the tournament, following earlier losses despite strong individual showings from the Los Angeles Lakers player. The performance also made Dončić the youngest player to score 400 career EuroBasket points since Tony Parker in 2007. Slovenia must win its final two group matches to guarantee advancement to the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at an incident-filled Dutch Grand Prix, a win that significantly extends his championship lead. The race saw a dramatic turn when his teammate, Lando Norris, was forced to retire from a comfortable second-place position due to an oil leak with only seven laps remaining. The event, which featured three safety cars and multiple crashes, proved disastrous for Ferrari, with both of their drivers crashing out. Piastri's seventh victory of the season could be a decisive moment in the title race, widening his lead over Norris to 34 points.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta discusses innovative research into chronic pain that reverses the traditional scientific process. This "reverse translational research" begins with a patient's real-world experience and then uses advanced tools like brain imaging and implanted electrodes to identify objective biomarkers for their subjective pain. Gupta highlights a groundbreaking trial where scientists were able to map the unique neural signature of a patient's pain. This allowed them to predict pain bursts and use deep brain stimulation to interrupt the signals, offering a potential future where pain can be objectively measured and treated.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, the voice behind Creedence Clearwater Revival, has released a new album of his classic songs after a decades-long legal battle to regain control of his music. After the band's breakup, Fogerty lost the rights to his own compositions, a painful experience that led him to stop performing them for many years. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he recently bought back the rights and re-recorded the iconic tracks with his sons for the album "Legacy." Fogerty, now 80, reflects on the emotional process of revisiting the songs and the joy of finally owning the music he created.</p>

          <p>A pet sitter in Llanharan, Wales, had an unexpected experience when the pregnant Labrador she was watching went into labor a week early, while the owner was on holiday abroad. Rhian Boxall was told the dog, Tilly, was expecting about six puppies, but she ended up helping deliver a massive litter of 14 over a 15-hour period.

White expressed initial apprehension about playing the iconic musician, citing the intimate relationship fans have with Springsteen's work and his own lack of musical experience. He found a connection to the role through the feeling of fraudulence Springsteen was experiencing at that point in his life. White, who learned to play guitar and sing for the part, ultimately received the approval of Springsteen himself for his performance.</p>
