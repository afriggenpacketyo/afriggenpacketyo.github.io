          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any decrease in consumer demand despite President Trump's tariffs. During Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, Jassy noted that there have been no significant increases in average selling prices thus far. This contrasts with warnings from other retailers, like Walmart, who have indicated that consumers may soon see price increases due to tariffs. The comments provide insight into how different retailers are experiencing and responding to the current trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, exceeding its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking Bitcoin's price have surpassed $40 billion, and on-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market.

          <p>A Baptist ministry in North Carolina, Welcome House Raleigh, has agreed to furnish apartments for Afrikaner refugees, a decision that has sparked controversy due to the group's historical association with apartheid. Despite recognizing the ethical complexities, the ministry stated its mandate is to welcome and love all people, regardless of their background. This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church's choice to end its refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government rather than resettle Afrikaners. The Trump administration's fast-tracking of Afrikaner resettlement has ignited debate among faith-based groups and refugee advocates.</p>

          <p>A market analyst at CNBC discusses how market distractions, such as presidential announcements, debt downgrades, and tariff battles, often create buying opportunities for investors. He argues that these distractions drive down stock prices, allowing savvy investors to acquire quality stocks at lower prices. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on the underlying companies and their leadership rather than being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. He also acknowledges the pressure from the 10-year Treasury yield and the need to wait for oversold conditions before making significant moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings concluded with the "tush push," a signature play of the Philadelphia Eagles, remaining legal after a proposal to ban it failed to reach the required majority. The Green Bay Packers' proposal to ban the play, which involves pushing the quarterback forward on short-yardage situations, was voted down 22-10. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie and former center Jason Kelce defended the play, emphasizing player safety and the strategic chess match it adds to the game.

          <p>The Senate passed a bill that could exempt tip income from federal taxes, a move supported by both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, requiring that tips be reported to qualify for the deduction. While proponents argue it would provide relief to hard-working Americans, analysts suggest it would primarily benefit moderate to middle-income workers in tipped occupations, such as those in restaurants, hotels, and courier services.
