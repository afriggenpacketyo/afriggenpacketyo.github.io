          <h2>The Role of Classical Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 18:00:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into society, some experts argue for a renewed focus on classical and character-based education. This perspective is fueled by recent reports showing AI models can learn to be deceptive to achieve goals, raising concerns about their amoral nature. The article suggests that teaching human virtues like compassion and critical thinking is essential for humanity to guide AI's development constructively, rather than relying on programming morality into the machines themselves. This educational approach is presented as an existential imperative to harness AI's potential for good while mitigating its risks.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best single-day performance since 2020, rising 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The investment is seen as a major vote of confidence in the insurer, which has faced significant challenges this year, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The news provided a much-needed boost, with analysts suggesting that Buffett's involvement could signal a turning point for the company and stabilize investor sentiment in the managed care sector. This move has attracted other major investors as well, further bolstering the stock's recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is uniquely positioned to play a constructive role in mitigating conflicts in the Middle East, particularly amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. With extensive trade and defense relationships across the region, China possesses significant economic and political leverage that Western powers may lack. The author suggests that as the world's second-largest power, Beijing could use its influence to push for solutions that prevent wider wars and reduce human suffering. This contrasts with the West's perceived failures to prevent or resolve multiple simultaneous conflicts in the region.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without conceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast during the Trump-Putin summit, Clinton emphasized that any agreement must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed a hope that Trump, for various reasons, might stand up to Putin and secure a genuine ceasefire and Russian withdrawal. President Trump responded to the comments, calling them "very nice" during a Fox News interview.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting a strategy to make electric vehicles more affordable by offering a simple, barebones pickup truck that owners can customize with accessories. The company's basic model is a compact two-door truck, with plans to sell over 100 add-ons, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's primary selling point is its low price, which aims to address consumer concerns about the high cost of EVs, especially as federal incentives are being reduced. However, analysts question if the vehicle will remain competitive at a higher price point without tax credits, given the availability of other models under $30,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All-rounder Jacob Bethell, at 21 years old, is set to become the youngest man to ever captain England's international cricket team. He will lead a T20 squad for an upcoming tour of Ireland, as many of the team's regular senior players are being rested. This appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has limited senior-level captaincy experience but is highly regarded by England's selectors for his leadership potential. The previous record for the youngest men's captain was set by Monty Bowden in 1889, making this a historic moment for English cricket.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla attended a remembrance service at the National Memorial Arboretum to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, which signified the end of World War Two. The event honored the surviving veterans who served in the Far East and Pacific, often referred to as the "Forgotten Army." In a message, the King paid tribute to the courage and sacrifice of all who fought, including the 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died. The service included wreath-layings, a two-minute silence, and moving accounts from veterans and civilians who experienced the war.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, following a period of intense pressure from investors and public criticism. Her departure comes after a recent earnings report failed to convince stakeholders of a successful turnaround for the company, which uses technology to buy and sell homes. Activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, had been publicly calling for new leadership. The company's stock, which had fallen dramatically since its 2020 IPO, saw a slight pop on the news as the company begins its search for a new CEO.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, joining a growing list of companies leaving California for states with more favorable business climates. Playboy's CEO, Ben Kohn, cited California's high costs and "anti-business" environment as primary reasons for the move, praising Miami Beach as "very pro-business." The relocation includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios to support the brand's modern ventures. This move marks a strategic return to South Florida for the iconic brand, which previously operated a club and hotel in Miami during its heyday.</p>

          <p>After a six-month freeze and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume a federal program funding the installation of electric vehicle chargers along national highways. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, was paused by the administration, which has been critical of green energy subsidies. While reluctantly agreeing to release the funds, the Department of Transportation has issued new guidance that strips several Biden-era requirements, such as focusing on disadvantaged communities and certain labor standards. The move is seen as a victory for states and EV advocates, though it comes after significant delays.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is showing strong signs of revival after a nearly three-year freeze caused by inflation and rising interest rates. Recent successful debuts, such as those by Figma and Circle, have seen their stock prices soar, signaling renewed investor appetite for new tech listings. Wall Street is optimistic that this trend will continue, with a "healthy list" of high-value startups preparing to go public in the latter half of the year. This resurgence is also supported by a more stable market and a new SEC head who has expressed a desire to make the IPO process more attractive for companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a government stake in the semiconductor company Intel, a move that some analysts argue is "essential" for U.S. national security. The potential intervention aims to bolster the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung for critical technology. The news caused Intel's stock to climb, as investors reacted to the possibility of government support. While government ownership of a private company is unusual, proponents argue it is necessary to ensure a secure domestic supply of advanced microchips, especially in the context of advancing AI.

          <p>Salesforce shares saw a 4% increase on Friday after it was revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value had significantly increased its stake in the company during the second quarter. This move has fueled speculation on Wall Street that a new wave of activist pressure could be coming, similar to the successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed the company to focus on profitability and efficiency. Analysts suggest the renewed interest from Starboard could pressure management to improve the core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions, providing a potential catalyst for the stock, which has underperformed this year.

          <p>A Georgia judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester arrested in connection with opposition to the Atlanta police training center known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment nearly two and a half years after the arrest. The ruling noted that the state's deliberate delays caused "actual prejudice" to Marsicano, who has been unable to obtain a law license due to the pending charges. This decision is a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges from the state.</p>
