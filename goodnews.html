          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the "steady progress" in improving bilateral relations with China, following years of strained ties that included a deadly 2020 border clash. This diplomatic thaw began with a meeting between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia last year, marking their first formal discussion since 2019. Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in seven years, signals a significant warming of relations. The article suggests that U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, which have strained ties between New Delhi and Washington, have also contributed to India and China increasing official visits and discussing eased trade restrictions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that Intel must provide the U.S. government an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, marking a significant policy shift from the Biden administration's grant approach. This new condition, championed by the Trump administration, aims to secure a return for taxpayer money invested in chip manufacturing, though without granting the government voting or governance rights in the company. Intel, which had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant for building factories in Ohio, is now subject to this requirement. This move aligns with President Trump's broader agenda to reshore U.S. manufacturing and could establish a precedent for other companies receiving CHIPS Act funding.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national residing illegally in the U.S., Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for conspiring to smuggle weapons, ammunition, and sensitive U.S. technology to North Korea. Wen pleaded guilty to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and acting as an illegal foreign agent. He admitted to receiving approximately $2 million from North Korean officials to procure goods, which he then concealed in shipping containers falsely labeled as consumer items. Federal agents seized a chemical threat identification device and ammunition from his home, confirming his intent to send them to North Korea's military, highlighting a successful interdiction of illegal activities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court finally affirmed that drag shows are protected by the First Amendment, overturning a ban by a public university president in Texas. This decision in Spectrum WT v. Wendler came after a two-year delay, during which the unconstitutional ban remained in effect, causing "irreparable injury" to students who were denied their rights. The article critically examines the judicial process, particularly the actions of trial judge Matthew Kacsmaryk and the appellate courts' refusal to expedite the case, for prolonging the denial of constitutional freedoms. It highlights how courts can manipulate timelines to favor certain litigants, effectively delaying justice even when the legal outcome should be clear.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly boosting iPhone production at five factories in India, including new plants and facilities belonging to Tata Group and Foxconn Technology, in preparation for the iPhone 17 launch. This expansion aligns with Apple's broader strategy to reduce its reliance on China due to ongoing trade tensions. The move comes as the White House, specifically Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, criticizes India for "profiteering" by purchasing and reselling cheap Russian oil, leading to increased U.S. tariffs of up to 100%. Despite this geopolitical friction, Apple's substantial commitment to investing in U.S. manufacturing is expected to mitigate the impact of India-related tariffs on the company's operations.</p>

          <p>The future of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak remains a major talking point in the summer transfer window, with Liverpool's £110m bid already rejected and no new offers yet. Sources indicate Liverpool's renewed interest hinges on Newcastle securing two replacement strikers, a challenging task given the difficulty in convincing clubs to part with key players at this stage of the window. Newcastle publicly maintains Isak is not for sale, but Liverpool anticipates a minimum £120m bid once replacements are in place. The situation highlights the complexities of player transfers, the financial pressures on clubs, and the player's uncertain status with his current team.</p>

          <p>As discussions on ending the war in Ukraine intensify, the concept of U.S.-backed "NATO-style" security guarantees for Ukraine is gaining prominence. While Russia has reportedly agreed to the U.S. offering "Article-5 like protection," details remain scarce. President Trump has stated the U.S. would coordinate security guarantees with European nations, ruling out American ground troops but suggesting air support and intelligence sharing. Military analysts emphasize that such guarantees would need to be credible and enduring, potentially involving a "reassurance force" of European soldiers, significant military supplies, and training to enable Ukraine to build its own robust defense capabilities for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>NASA's Webb Space Telescope has made a new and exciting discovery, spotting a previously unknown tiny moon orbiting Uranus. This new lunar addition, estimated to be just six miles wide, was identified by the telescope's near-infrared camera during observations in February. Scientists believe its faintness and small size allowed it to remain undetected for so long, even eluding the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its flyby about 40 years ago. The discovery increases Uranus's known moon count to 29, with this newest, yet-unnamed, member joining a group of moons typically named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial savings, high-yield savings accounts present a compelling option to earn significant returns compared to traditional accounts, which often lose value to inflation. With a $150,000 deposit at a competitive 4.35% APY, such an account could earn over $1,600 in interest within three months and more than $6,500 over a year. While interest rates are variable and subject to Federal Reserve policies, current elevated rates offer genuine opportunities for savvy savers. The article advises looking for accounts with no monthly fees and reasonable minimums, emphasizing that delaying action means missing out on potential earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

This historic $0 transaction marks a significant moment for a tribe that lacked federal recognition and direct means to negotiate for land.
