          <p>Nicusor Dan, the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion initially gained momentum due to public dissatisfaction with mainstream parties and political instability. Dan's campaign focused on combating corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion criticized the EU and opposed aid to Kyiv. Despite Simion's strong support in the diaspora, Dan ultimately secured victory, emphasizing the need for national unity and profound change in Romania.</p>

Governor Murphy expressed relief and urged commuters to work from home on Monday to facilitate the resumption of service. The main point of contention was the engineers' demand for pay parity with their counterparts at other railroads.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer," explores the story of Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor who pioneered the profiling of serial killers for the FBI. Burgess began interviewing sexual assault victims in the 1960s and identified patterns of behavior that helped law enforcement understand the thinking of offenders. Her work led to insights into high-profile cases, and she is now working with her granddaughter to profile school shooters. Burgess also trains nurses to recognize signs of sexual assault in dementia care facilities.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won the US PGA Championship by five strokes, despite a challenge from Jon Rahm.

English finished with the lowest round on Sunday, securing his best finish at a major. Rahm said the fact he got himself in the mix on the final day will do a lot to dispel the discussion about a drop-off in his results at majors since his switch to LIV at the end of 2023.</p>
