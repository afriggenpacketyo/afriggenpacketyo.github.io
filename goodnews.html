          <p>This article recounts how Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, potentially saved the life of Chris Smith after he was shot in the head during a violent incident on Thanksgiving Day 2021. Smith was found by EMT Dennis Hobson in his Farmersville, Illinois home alongside his deceased date, Leslie Reeves. Hobson noted that Tiki was huddled with Smith, providing warmth in the cold house, which likely helped him survive the 12 hours before he was rescued. Robert Tarr, Reeves' ex-boyfriend, was convicted of murder and attempted murder in connection with the shooting. Smith, despite suffering from paralysis, is recovering and has started a motivational speaking business.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a critical issue for voters in high-tax states. Some Republicans want the cap abolished, while others support raising it to $30,000, leading to internal disagreements. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved.

The four-week average of claims rose slightly to 230,500, and the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits increased to 1.88 million.

          <p>Alibaba shares dropped 5% in premarket trading after the Chinese e-commerce giant missed earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, with revenue at 236.5 billion Chinese yuan and net income at 12.4 billion yuan. Despite the revenue being up 7% year-on-year and net income still 279% higher year-on-year, analysts were hoping the company's investments in artificial intelligence and its core e-commerce business would help it hit or exceed high expectations. Macroeconomic volatility and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have affected consumer sentiment in China.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the U.S. may be entering a period of more frequent supply shocks and volatile inflation, warranting more transparent communication practices from the central bank. He stressed the need to maintain inflation expectations at 2% and noted that higher interest rates adjusted for inflation may reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward. Powell's comments came in a speech kicking off a five-year review of the central bank's monetary policy framework.</p>
