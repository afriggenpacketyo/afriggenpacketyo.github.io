          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, this article argues that strong underlying economic factors will continue to support the stock market. It highlights ten points, including excellent corporate earnings, significant tax relief for individuals and businesses from the "One Big Beautiful Bill," and massive investment in data centers and the energy sector. The author dismisses fears of a market downturn related to trade disputes, suggesting these positive domestic drivers are more impactful. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ projects that the technology will cross a critical "usefulness" threshold for practical applications within the next five years. The founder compared the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, indicating a period of rapid transition and potential is ahead. SpinQ currently produces both educational and industrial-grade quantum computers, selling its technology to over 50 countries as it works toward broader commercial viability.</p>

The win leaves Scheffler needing only a U.S. Open title to complete the coveted career Grand Slam in professional golf.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have announced a significant drop in the number of people considered missing after the devastating Hill Country floods, with the count now at three, down from over 100. This sharp decrease is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, who successfully verified the safety of many individuals initially reported as unaccounted for.

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article argues this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and protects long-term mental health. Parents can cultivate this by validating their child's feelings, allowing for age-appropriate autonomy, and modeling their own emotional awareness, rather than dismissing or micromanaging their child's experiences.</p>
