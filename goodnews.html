          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney stated that they are taking a step back to fully discuss their options and ensure the safety and well-being of their children. A federal judge previously expressed suspicion that the administration deported the child without due process. The Department of Justice argued that it was in the minor's best interest to remain in her mother's custody, given that she is a U.S. citizen.</p>

          <p>Negotiations for President Donald Trump's tax agenda are intensifying, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support via reconciliation, but the process faces challenges due to a narrow House majority and competing priorities. Key proposals could impact millions of Americans, with some lawmakers pushing for a more fiscally responsible package. The narrow Republican majority in the House is going to make that process very difficult because a handful of votes can block the bill.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake shook Tennessee and surrounding states, with tremors felt as far away as Atlanta. The earthquake, centered near Greenback, Tennessee, prompted thousands of reports to the USGS. While no significant damage or injuries were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of the region's seismic activity. The south-eastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid seismic zone to the west and in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, which is where Saturday‚Äôs earthquake occurred.</p>
