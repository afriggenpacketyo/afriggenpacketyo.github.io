        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocates in the UK are calling for a change in cosmetic labeling regulations, urging that ingredients be listed in English rather than the currently used Latin-based scientific names. Campaigners, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, argue that the Latin nomenclature puts consumers with allergies at significant risk, as many cannot recognize potential allergens. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global harmonization, parents and consumers share stories of dangerous allergic reactions, highlighting the need for clearer, more accessible information similar to food packaging standards.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembélé has experienced a remarkable transformation under coach Luis Enrique, evolving from a talented but inconsistent winger into a pivotal, high-pressing central attacker. Previously known for injuries and discipline issues at Barcelona, the 28-year-old has become a leader through his relentless defensive work and prolific goal-scoring, earning praise as the season's best player. This evolution is attributed to the coach's trust and a system that leverages his skills, highlighting a significant career turnaround. His newfound dedication and on-field intelligence have been crucial to PSG's recent successes.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures peaking above 33°C in parts of England and Wales, and Scotland recording its warmest day since 2023. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and central England, warning of potential health risks, especially for vulnerable populations. The hot, dry conditions have prompted hosepipe bans for millions and led to extreme wildfire warnings in Scotland and an active blaze in Surrey. Forecasters expect the heat to ease on Monday, with cooler temperatures and rain predicted for many areas.</p>

          <p>A recent scientific study indicates that China's large-scale dam projects on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet may alleviate, rather than worsen, water scarcity issues for downstream nations like India. Contrary to fears that the dams would cause droughts, data collected since 2014 from existing dams shows a significant increase in water flow during the dry season, with levels up by over 50% in February. This research provides the first concrete evidence on the downstream impact of these controversial projects, suggesting they could help regulate water supply throughout the year.</p>
