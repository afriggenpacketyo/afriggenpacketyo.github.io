          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling prevents a policy change that could have deprived universities of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued would threaten critical work in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Talwani deemed the change, which capped indirect costs at 15%, as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. This decision follows similar blocks against the Trump administration's attempts to cap grants from the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health, protecting vital research projects. The judge's decision protects critical research funding.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, has been released from ICE detention after a federal judge ruled he was not a threat or flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation due to his pro-Palestinian activism, which they deemed detrimental to foreign policy interests. Upon his arrival in New Jersey, Khalil stated that his activism would continue despite the attempts to suppress it. The judge's decision allows Khalil to remain free while his deportation proceedings continue, marking a victory for free speech advocates. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greeted Khalil at the airport, calling his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana following a judge's order. Khalil had been in custody for months while the Trump administration sought to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns related to his activism. After his release, Khalil stated that the Trump administration had "chosen the wrong person" to target. The judge determined that Khalil was not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and his attorneys argued that his detention was an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.

          <p>French scientists have discovered a new blood type, dubbed "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe. The discovery was made after researchers identified an unusual antibody in a blood sample taken from the patient in 2011. The International Society of Blood Transfusion has officially recognized the new blood group system. Scientists used high-throughput DNA sequencing to unravel the mystery, highlighting a genetic mutation. The patient is the only known carrier of this blood type, and scientists hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that global population data may significantly underestimate rural populations, potentially by 53% to 84%. Researchers from Aalto University analyzed data from 300 rural dam projects across 35 countries and found discrepancies with existing population datasets. This underreporting could have consequences for resource allocation within countries. However, some experts remain skeptical, arguing that such a large undercount is unlikely given the extensive data collection efforts over the years. The study highlights the challenges in accurately counting populations in remote areas.</p>
