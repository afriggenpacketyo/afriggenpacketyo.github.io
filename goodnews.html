          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has achieved a significant milestone by capturing a highly detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this tool will enhance their ability to predict solar storms, which can disrupt radio communications and electrical grids on Earth. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) hailed the VTF as the 'heart' of the telescope, emphasizing its potential to answer critical questions in solar physics and mitigate the impact of geomagnetic disturbances. The construction of the telescope faced protests from native Hawaiians due to its placement on sacred land.</p>

The lack of high-quality trials to guide safe tapering off antidepressants has led patients to seek solutions in online communities.

          <p>Erika Roberts, a 27-year-old American, moved to Germany for medical school, where she pays only $97 a semester in tuition. Roberts, who grew up in Philadelphia, was inspired by a high school exchange program and felt unfulfilled studying biochemistry in the US. She chose Germany because it does not require a Bachelor's degree for medical school and offers lower tuition costs. Roberts loves the sense of safety, access to good food and accessibility in Germany, and doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S. permanently anytime soon.</p>
