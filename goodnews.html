          <p>A social media post has gone viral after a man described refusing to eat a raw chicken his wife had inadvertently left in their car for several hours. The man explained that while the car was in the sun on a 60°F day, he felt the risk of food poisoning was too high, despite his wife's insistence that the chicken still felt cool. His decision to make a separate meal for himself sparked a family argument and a wide-ranging online debate. While some commenters felt he overreacted, food safety experts confirmed his caution was warranted due to the risk of heat-resistant toxins from bacterial growth.</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, has persevered for over a century by adhering to the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement. While the city around it experienced industrial booms and busts, Pewabic has consistently focused on handcrafted tiles and vessels, renowned for their unique, iridescent glazes. The studio, now a non-profit, still uses much of its original equipment and techniques to create its distinctive ceramics. After facing financial struggles, the pottery has seen a resurgence, achieving record sales by catering to a modern appreciation for artisanal, handmade goods.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 14:49:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners aged 70, a reverse mortgage can provide a significant source of retirement income, with recent changes making it a more compelling option. The amount available depends on the home's value, the borrower's age, and interest rates, with a 70-year-old typically able to access around 41% of their home's value up to the FHA's new limit of $1,209,750. This translates to a potential gross loan of nearly $500,000 for a home at the maximum value, before fees and other costs. Strategies like choosing a line of credit and comparing lender fees can help maximize the benefits of this financial tool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric aircraft developer Joby Aviation is partnering with defense contractor L3Harris to create a new generation of military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The collaboration will adapt Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology, combining it with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The new craft will be a hybrid gas-turbine vehicle designed for applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments. This partnership reflects a growing military interest in smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable autonomous aircraft for modern battlefield operations.</p>

          <p>The Untold Story, an Anaheim bookstore focusing on BIPOC authors and community activism, has successfully relocated after its previous isolated location proved unworkable. Owner Lizzette Barrios Gracián has reopened in a more central spot, where the store is flourishing as a cultural hub for author events, open mic nights, and community organizing. Despite the challenges of running an independent bookstore, the new location has attracted a diverse and loyal clientele. The space provides a welcoming environment that many locals say was previously lacking in the city, feeling less like a retail store and more like a home.</p>

          <p>Despite a weak U.S. jobs report and new tariffs unsettling the broader market, strong quarterly earnings from tech giants Apple and Amazon have helped calm fears of a tech stock bubble. Both companies reported robust growth, with Apple's services and iPhone sales showing strength, while Amazon's AWS cloud business saw accelerating demand driven by AI. These results, along with impressive reports from Meta and Microsoft, suggest that the growth momentum for large-cap tech is intact. Analysts believe these performances validate the high valuations and show that AI is unlocking significant new avenues for profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual mid-game trade, infielder José Caballero was dealt from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees while the two teams were playing against each other. Caballero started the game for the Rays, even recording a putout and an at-bat, before being informed of the trade in the dugout during the seventh inning. He was seen saying goodbye to his stunned Rays teammates before the game concluded. After the Yankees' 7-4 victory, Caballero joked that he was on the winning team regardless and expressed excitement about joining the team he rooted for as a child.</p>

          <p>A new experimental Latin music project, Bajo La Luna, is launching a concert series at the Ford Theatre in Hollywood, aiming to use music as a ritual for healing and social change. The inaugural event will feature contemporary folk musicians Silvia Pérez Cruz, La Muchacha, and a special ensemble from Y La Bamba. Organizers hope the initiative will provide a moment of reprieve and create a safe space for the community, particularly in response to the fear caused by recent immigration raids across Los Angeles.

          <p>A man from Pensacola, Florida, has been arrested for stealing multiple Smokey Bear signs from various state forests during his travels to Orlando. According to the Office of Agricultural Law Enforcement, the man was reselling the iconic signs on Facebook Marketplace for $1,900. Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture, Wilton Simpson, announced the arrest on social media. The suspect was taken into custody on July 30, with the commissioner humorously thanking Smokey Bear for assisting in the arrest. Further details about the suspect and the specific charges have not yet been released.</p>

          <h2>Is Credit Card Debt Forgiveness a Viable Strategy in the Current Rate Environment?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 13:39:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Even with the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, credit card debt forgiveness remains a worthwhile strategy for consumers struggling with high balances. Average credit card APRs are still near record highs of 22%, and any future Fed rate cuts are unlikely to provide substantial relief to borrowers. For those at risk of default, negotiating a settlement to reduce the principal debt can be more effective than waiting for minor interest rate changes. This approach can provide a faster path to financial stability, typically resolving enrolled debts within two to four years. (not investment advice)</p>
