          <p>The Camogie Association's enforcement of skort wearing in camogie matches has ignited a debate over sexism and player comfort. Former Antrim All-Star Jane Adams calls the rule "sexism" and urges the association to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts. A Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The article notes that a Special Congress has been called to vote on the issue, and that the Munster senior camogie final was deferred after the Cork team indicated they would wear shorts in the final and if they were asked to change to skorts they would refuse to do so.</p>
