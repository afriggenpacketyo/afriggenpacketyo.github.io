Pirro credited the deployment of federal agencies and National Guard troops, now authorized to carry firearms, with reshaping public safety and deterring criminals. The operation, initiated in early August, escalated with the temporary federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department, a historic move.

          <p>The Edinburgh Fringe Festival, one of the world's largest arts festivals, is grappling with questions about whether it has lost its "fringe" identity due to escalating costs and increasing corporate influence. While historically a vital platform for experimental and alternative acts, both performers and attendees now lament the prohibitive expenses for participation and tickets, making it less accessible for emerging artists. Despite its track record in launching careers for talents like Robin Williams and Lin-Manuel Miranda, concerns are mounting that the festival is becoming out of reach for those not already famous or financially secure. This article explores the tension between the festival's artistic roots and its commercial evolution.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move aimed at bolstering its struggling coffee business and establishing a "global coffee champion." The deal, expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years, is slated to close in the first half of 2026. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to split into two separate, U.S.-listed companies: one dedicated to coffee brands and the other to cold beverages like Dr Pepper and Snapple. This major restructuring seeks to optimize growth and navigate fierce competition and volatile commodity prices in the beverage industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Fernand is expected to transition into a post-tropical system by Wednesday. This marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, and aligns with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal season, providing a routine update on its path and intensity.</p>

          <p>A tech worker, Eric Thompson, is spearheading efforts to ban "ghost job" advertisements through proposed federal legislation called the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act. Frustrated after losing his job and encountering numerous fake listings, Thompson's working group seeks to mandate transparency, requiring job posts to include intended hire and start dates, clarify if roles are new, and set limits on posting duration. This initiative addresses a common and time-consuming headache for job seekers, as companies often post openings without a specific intent to hire for various strategic reasons. The movement aims to promote honesty and fairness in the national hiring process.</p>

Conversely, stocks are favored for long-term wealth building due providing the potential for significantly higher returns, albeit with greater market risk and volatility.

Roth 401(k)s offer higher contribution limits and often include employer matches, but typically come with fewer investment choices and potentially higher fees. In contrast, Roth IRAs provide greater flexibility, allowing penalty-free withdrawal of contributions at any time, but are subject to lower contribution limits and income restrictions for direct contributions.
