          <p>Top tennis players, including Amanda Anisimova and Carlos Alcaraz, are increasingly discussing the importance of mental health amid the sport's demanding 11-month season. Anisimova, a Wimbledon semi-finalist, took a significant break from tennis to address burnout, a step she credits for her recent success and return to the world's top 10. Other players like Andrey Rublev and Aryna Sabalenka also shared their strategies for managing psychological pressure, from working with therapists to fostering open communication. The conversations highlight a growing awareness of the mental toll of professional sports.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred within the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a massive infrastructure project designed to manage wastewater. The workers were reportedly able to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape the collapsed section and were then shuttled out from a distance of over five miles underground. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and thankfully, no significant injuries were reported among the rescued crew.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally cut down in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent public memorial. The trunk is now on display at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre in Northumberland, near where the tree once stood. The installation, created by artist Charlie Whinney, is designed to be interactive, allowing visitors to touch and even hug the trunk. The display also includes benches inscribed with public messages of grief and hope, serving as a testament to the tree's cultural significance and the outrage its destruction caused.</p>

          <p>To address persistent labor market pressures, China's State Council has announced a new one-off subsidy for companies that hire unemployed young people aged 16 to 24. Employers who provide formal contracts and full social insurance contributions for at least three months can receive up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This measure, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, aims to stabilize employment and support household incomes amid a sluggish economy. Additionally, the government has allocated 10 billion yuan to expand its 'work-for-relief' public works program to further generate jobs.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the maker of cereals like Corn Flakes and Fruit Loops for the North American market, soared by more than 50% following reports of advanced takeover talks. The potential buyer is the Italian confectionery giant Ferrero, owner of brands like Nutella and Kinder, with a deal reportedly valued around $3 billion. This acquisition would give Ferrero a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. The move comes as traditional food companies face challenges from rising costs and a consumer shift towards healthier options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5%, opting for stability as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures to cool Seoul's overheating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% year-over-year in June, prompting government intervention to curb household debt. Despite some concerns about slowing economic growth, the Bank of Korea prioritized financial stability, citing the significant acceleration in both housing prices and household debt. Analysts expect the bank may consider a rate cut later in the year once the housing market shows signs of stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 13 brown pelicans, who were sickened by a toxic algal bloom, have been successfully treated and released back into the wild in Huntington Beach. The recent bloom was the most severe in Southern California since 2015, poisoning hundreds of seabirds and marine mammals with domoic acid. The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center rescued and rehabilitated the birds, and their release was celebrated by the community. The event serves as a positive reminder of successful wildlife conservation efforts, even as the region faces increasingly frequent and dangerous environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA. The appointment comes weeks after the president withdrew his initial nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, citing a review of his 'prior associations' and noting he was a Democrat recommended by Elon Musk. In a social media post, Trump praised Duffy as a 'fantastic leader' for the space agency. This move places another cabinet member in a dual-hatted role and comes at a critical time for NASA as it pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and a future mission to Mars.</p>

          <p>Freddie, a 5-year-old Beagle working for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is recovering after being kicked by a traveler at Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when Freddie alerted his handler to a bag containing prohibited food items. The traveler, a 70-year-old Egyptian national, intentionally kicked the dog in the ribs with enough force to lift him off the ground. The man pleaded guilty to assaulting a police animal and paid the vet bill. Freddie sustained bruising but has since been cleared to return to his job of detecting illegal agricultural products.</p>
