        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has stepped in to provide Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with millions of dollars in emergency funding after the Trump administration withheld funds designated by Congress. The news network, founded during the Cold War to combat Soviet propaganda, faces a financial crisis that has led to furloughs and programming cuts. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced the $6.2 million contribution, emphasizing the importance of supporting the network's independent journalism, particularly its reporting on Russia and Hungary. The article suggests this crisis could lead to a more stable funding model involving both European and American contributions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has implemented a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures for consumers. Under the scheme, the government will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, targeting a 7.40 yen per liter reduction in the first week. The subsidy aims to reduce the price by at least 1 yen weekly until it is 10 yen lower by mid-June. With around 1 trillion yen allocated, the subsidies could last until the end of March 2026, ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals.

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, following Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The Bank of America heralded emerging markets as "the next bull market" recently. JPMorgan upgraded emerging market equities from neutral to overweight, citing thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. A dented confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasurys, equities and the greenback, has fueled bullishness for emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>
