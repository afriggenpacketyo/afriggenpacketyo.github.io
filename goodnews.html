          <p>Senators Pete Ricketts and John Fetterman are joining forces on bipartisan legislation aimed at increasing oversight of foreign countries acquiring American farmland. The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to address concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) regarding the current system's inadequacy in monitoring foreign ownership, particularly by China. The bill mandates AFIDA reporting for foreign entities with more than one percent interest in American agricultural land, enhancing information sharing and establishing a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system. This legislative effort reflects growing concerns about food security and national security related to foreign investment in U.S. agriculture. </p>

          <p>California, along with Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, has petitioned the FDA to ease new restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone, arguing the drug's safety record proves the limits unnecessary. Attorney General Rob Bonta cited concerns that the restrictions burden access to critical healthcare, particularly for low-income and rural women. The petition challenges Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s review of mifepristone, which cited flawed data questioning its safety. The states argue no new scientific data justifies altering the conclusion that mifepristone is safe and effective, asserting the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for the drug is medically unjustified. </p>
