          <p>Sebastian Fowler, a California comedian, has become the first person to bike across the U.S. on a 20-inch BMX bike, traveling 3,333 miles from San Diego to New York in 80 days. Fowler undertook this journey to raise money to buy 100 BMX bicycles for underprivileged children, inspired by his own experience of finding solace in BMX after losing his father. He carried 60 pounds of gear and slept in various makeshift locations, performing comedy shows along the way, including an appearance on Netflix's "Kill Tony." He has raised over $9,000 towards his goal and hopes to provide bikes to kids who cannot afford them, honoring his father's memory.</p>

Potential daily record highs are also forecast for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures well into the 90s reaching the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

          <p>Mark Cuban, entrepreneur and founder of Cost Plus Drugs, suggests two key changes to improve the U.S. healthcare system. First, he proposes separating formularies from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to reduce their control over drug pricing. Second, he suggests requiring Medicare Advantage and Part D plans to purchase from any provider offering lower out-of-pocket costs to patients. Cuban also advocates for providers to honor publicly listed cash prices, banning specialty drug pricing tiers, and holding provider CEOs personally liable for billing fraud.
