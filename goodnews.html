          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 15:44:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate tax bill includes a provision for a $1,000 "baby bonus" to be deposited into "Trump accounts" for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028. To qualify, children must be U.S. citizens at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers, and if parents don't open an account, the Treasury Secretary will establish one. These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax-deferred earnings and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains, with funds accessible for education, first home down payments, or small business capital. While proponents highlight wealth-building opportunities, some experts argue the accounts are overly complicated compared to simpler universal savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans have introduced a "no tax on tips" proposal as part of a broader tax cut package, mirroring a similar House GOP plan. Both versions offer a tax deduction on qualified tips, defined as those paid in cash, charged, or received through tip-sharing, available to both employees and independent contractors from 2025 through 2028. However, the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year, unlike the House bill, and features different income limits for eligibility. While the idea has bipartisan appeal, experts note that it may not benefit a large portion of the workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans struggle with medical debt, stemming from emergencies or unexpected diagnoses, leading to financial strain and credit score damage. Effective relief options include negotiating directly with providers for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care based on income, and using medical bill advocates to identify errors. Debt consolidation or management programs can help manage medical debt alongside other debts, while debt settlement is a last resort involving offering a lump sum payment lower than the total debt. Exploring these options early can maximize chances of a positive outcome and avoid lasting financial damage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MPs in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill addresses the 1% of abortions that occur after 24 weeks, providing care and support rather than criminalization for women in desperate circumstances. The new clause does not change existing laws regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, such as time limits and the requirement for two doctors' approval. Campaigners have welcomed the decision as a landmark moment for women's rights, while opponents have expressed concerns about the implications for the protection of unborn children.</p>

In May, streaming accounted for 44.8% of total TV viewership, while broadcast and cable combined represented 44.2%. The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) offerings, the rise of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies. Netflix has emerged as the leading subscription provider in total TV usage. While the milestone may fluctuate, Nielsen predicts streaming will eventually become the dominant form of TV consumption permanently.</p>

The likelihood of Chinese manufacturing comes amid Trump's past scrutiny of Apple's supply chain and his calls for more electronics manufacturing to be undertaken in the U.S.</p>
