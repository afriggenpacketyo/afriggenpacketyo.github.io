          <p>The UK is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures expected to reach 32C for a second consecutive day, potentially rising to 34C on Saturday, particularly in central England. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant pressures on health and social care services. Many regions are expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, sustaining temperature thresholds for three consecutive days, while the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for storms in parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. Firefighters are deeply concerned about the escalating threat of wildfires, with a 717% surge compared to the same period in 2024, and the public is urged to be cautious. The chance of reaching 32C in June has increased significantly due to human-induced climate change. </p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state and backed by other investors. The capital increase and debt refinancing plan will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. Eutelsat became the world's third-largest satellite operator after combining with British satellite firm OneWeb in 2023 and recently secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority-access space resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully tested artillery-launched drones capable of withstanding the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell after 12 years of development. The drones endured launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight during live-fire trials, thanks to a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism. This low-cost system separates the drone from the artillery shell mid-flight without electronic controls, enabling the drones to reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers and extend loiter time. The technology stems from a 2013 design called Tianyan ("sky eye"), which gained attention in a new-concept aircraft competition.</p>

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts following destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to guide the rebuilding process. The authority would aim to prevent land speculation and ensure that new homes are affordable for displaced people, while also promoting climate-resilient and equitable recovery. The commission also proposed a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District to focus on wildfire prevention and vegetation management.</p>

          <p>The musical "Parade," which tells the story of Leo Frank, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1913, has been revived at the Ahmanson Theatre, offering a poignant and timely reflection on antisemitism and systemic bias in the judicial system. The production, directed by Michael Arden, explores the cultural, historical, and political context of the trial, as well as the evolving relationship between Leo and his wife, Lucille. While the musical delves into dark themes, it also highlights the human figures caught in the snares of American bigotry, making the contemporary parallels resonate powerfully. The show balances intimacy and epic scope, reminding audiences of the dangers of prejudice and the importance of seeking justice.</p>

          <p>Amy Bloom's novel, "I'll Be Right Here," is a slim volume spanning close to a century, telling the story of an unconventional family that includes siblings, lovers, and adopted members. The novel opens with a tableau of friends tending to a dying woman, and compresses time, dwelling on certain details while allotting mere lines to pivotal moments. The plot zigs and zags, dipping in and out of each character's life, exploring themes of love, loss, and acceptance. Bloom's prose is finely wrought and her characters are rendered sublime, showcasing her ability to find new depth and dimension in the subject of love.</p>
