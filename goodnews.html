          <p>The Trump administration is holding a dinner for numerous high-profile tech executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates. The event, held in the White House's renovated Rose Garden, aims to foster relationships between the administration and the technology sector. Notably, Tesla CEO Elon Musk declined his invitation, citing a prior commitment, though he has had a public falling out with the president. The gathering highlights the complex but often close ties between the administration and major figures in the tech industry, many of whom have aligned with the president's goals on emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>CEOs of major sportsbooks like DraftKings and BetMGM are forecasting a record year for betting as the NFL season begins. The American Gaming Association projects that legal sports betting in the U.S. will increase by 8.5% to $30 billion this season. Despite broader economic concerns, the sector has shown resilience, with executives reporting no slowdown in consumer activity and significant growth in pre-season volume. The industry is also navigating the emergence of new competition from prediction markets, which operate like stock trading for events and are facing regulatory scrutiny over whether they constitute a form of sports betting.

          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides flood forecast visualizations for areas covering 60% of the U.S. population. The experimental tool offers near real-time, Google Earth-style maps showing the potential impact of floodwaters on specific neighborhoods. This expansion aims to enhance communication and decision-making for forecasters, emergency managers, and first responders during severe weather events. The tool, which has already proven effective in targeted evacuations, is scheduled for full nationwide activation next year, covering over 110,000 river miles and improving public safety against costly natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Broadcom is anticipated to announce significant fiscal third-quarter growth, with revenue expected to increase by 21% year-over-year to $15.83 billion. This strong performance is largely attributed to the booming demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, particularly the company's custom accelerator chips (XPUs) used by major cloud providers like Google and Meta. Analysts project that revenue from custom AI silicon could become a massive growth driver for the company in the coming years. The company's strategic acquisition of VMware is also contributing to its expansion in the infrastructure software market, solidifying its position as a key player in the AI revolution.

          <p>Shares of asset manager T. Rowe Price increased nearly 6% after announcing a strategic partnership with Goldman Sachs, which will invest up to $1 billion in the company. The collaboration is designed to offer private market investment products to a broader range of retail investors, including those with 401(k) plans. This move aligns with a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at increasing access to alternative assets for retirement savings. The deal provides a significant boost to T. Rowe Price, which has faced challenges in recent years due to its slower adoption of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old resident of Miami Gardens, has finally obtained her birth certificate after living her entire life without official proof of her birth. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she never received the document, which became a significant issue with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. Without proper identification, Lovette faced difficulties and feared potential detainment by immigration officials despite being a U.S. citizen. After a lengthy legal process initiated by her son and aided by local media attention, she has now received her Real ID, opening the door for her to get a passport and travel internationally.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, marking its lowest level since October of the previous year. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, provides increased purchasing power for potential homebuyers. The trend is largely driven by growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions heavily influence the bond market, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans, impacting housing affordability for millions.

          <p>The NBA is considering another change to its All-Star Game format for the 2026 event in Los Angeles, aiming to increase player effort and fan excitement. The proposed new format would be a round-robin tournament featuring three eight-player teams: two composed of U.S.-born players and one of international players. This structure addresses the numerical imbalance between American and international players in the league. The change comes after the 2024 game, which returned to a simple East vs. West format, was widely criticized for its lack of defensive effort, culminating in a record-high 211-186 final score that Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged was a "miss."</p>
