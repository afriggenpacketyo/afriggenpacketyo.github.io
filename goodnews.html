          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That May Slow Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 21:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents organ inflammation and aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential for future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the positive effects of exercise on the body.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A booming coffee culture in China is now spreading beyond major cities into the countryside, with a rising number of trendy, influencer-driven cafes opening in rural locations. While tea has traditionally been the nation's preferred beverage, coffee consumption is growing rapidly, with net imports increasing over six-fold between 2020 and 2024. This shift has created a new US$42 billion industry. However, some observers question the sustainability of the rural cafe trend, suggesting that many rely on novelty and social media appeal rather than building a loyal customer base.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves in NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. The signing came shortly after the team lost a key role player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had been a valuable contributor for the Lakers after being acquired from the Brooklyn Nets, known for his defensive versatility. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, provides the team with a new option who shot over 42% from three-point range last season.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched what it calls a "landmark" review of the entire parental leave and pay system, covering maternity, paternity, and shared leave policies. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the system has not been seriously examined for decades and needs modernization to better support working families and businesses. Campaign groups have welcomed the review, calling the current system one of the worst in the developed world and noting that low statutory pay prevents many fathers from taking leave. The review aims to address these long-standing issues and create a more effective framework for new parents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 of those troops to California's state command. The request comes as the state's specialized wildfire-fighting Guard unit is reportedly at just 40% of its regular staffing level with fire season underway. These troops had been federalized and deployed in response to immigration-related protests. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization, praised the request, urging the president to "stop the political theater" and return the troops to their critical firefighting duties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market trends by backing companies with bold, forward-looking ideas rather than established blue-chip stocks. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and Palantir, which are seen as innovative, while penalizing firms like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas. This shift has created an "idea market" focused on the potential of individual company stories and growth, rather than one dominated by institutional hedge funds reacting to Federal Reserve moves.

          <p>In a recent interview, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs on imports. He attributed this to mitigation strategies like forward-buying inventory by both Amazon and its third-party sellers, which has so far absorbed the costs. Jassy also discussed artificial intelligence, calling generative AI the "most transformative technology of our lifetime" and confirming Amazon's commitment to leaning into it.

          <p>Starting in July, energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will fall by 7% under the latest price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts caution that prices are unlikely to drop significantly more and may rise again, with bills remaining hundreds of pounds higher than pre-pandemic levels. With ongoing uncertainty in global markets, consumers are being encouraged to shop for fixed-rate deals to provide more stability over their energy costs for the upcoming winter.

While broad economic sanctions are being lifted, the White House clarified that targeted sanctions will remain on Assad himself, his associates, human rights abusers, and designated terrorist groups. The order also mandates a review of the terrorist designations for the Islamist group HTS, which formed the new transitional government, and its leader.</p>

The law was originally introduced to comply with a court ruling that same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections "functionally equivalent to marriage."

          <p>Film producer Randall Emmett has been removed from the Writers Guild of America's "strike list" after paying a $630,000 debt to resolve a long-standing dispute. The issue stemmed from his former company's failure to pay four writers for their work on a proposed television show in 2019. Being on the list effectively barred WGA members from working with him, complicating his current film projects, including a planned collaboration with Martin Scorsese. Emmett stated he made the personal decision to settle the debt because it was "the right thing to do."</p>
