        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has unveiled a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing the previous image that had drawn comparisons to a mugshot. In the new portrait, Trump stares directly into the camera with a serious expression, dressed in a blue suit and red tie against a dark backdrop. This contrasts with the earlier portrait from January, which featured lighting from below and an American flag backdrop, leading to unflattering comparisons. A White House official stated that the original portrait was always intended as a placeholder, and the new portrait reflects the "optimism and resolve of America."</p>

The company has also focused on improving customer experience by reducing employee turnover and optimizing inventory, while expanding its home delivery service and discretionary merchandise offerings.

          <p>The CDC is urging the tracking of a new norovirus strain, GII.17, after it disrupted the typical seasonal pattern of outbreaks last year. The new strain drove a record wave of outbreaks starting in October, earlier than the usual December surge. With GII.17 now dominant in over 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., questions arise about whether norovirus season could arrive early again. Other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus after GII.17 surged to dominance, suggesting a potential global shift in the virus's behavior.</p>

There were criticisms that his hard-driving style and overreliance on his starters wore down his players, but the Knicks had won a playoff series in three straight seasons under his leadership.</p>
