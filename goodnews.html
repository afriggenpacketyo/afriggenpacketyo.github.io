          <h2>Bill Belichick Reveals Spending $5,000 on Milk to Foster Brady-Brown Relationship</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed on "The Pivot" podcast that he once spent $5,000 on special milk requested by Antonio Brown for Tom Brady when Brown briefly played for the New England Patriots. The milk, intended to nurture the relationship between Brady and Brown, went bad after a mailroom mix-up. Belichick approved the expense to avoid damaging the connection between the two players, who later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick, now a college football coach, shared this anecdote from his book to highlight the importance of maintaining star player relationships.</p>

          <p>The WNBA is investigating allegations of racist comments directed towards Angel Reese during the Indiana Fever's game against the Chicago Sky. The investigation was prompted by reports of "hateful fan comments" during the game, though they are not believed to be directly related to an on-court incident between Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Both Clark and Reese have downplayed the incident, and the WNBA has stated it strongly condemns racism, hate, and discrimination in all forms.</p>
