          <p>SoftBank's shares experienced a significant 13% surge following the announcement of its $5.4 billion acquisition of ABB's robotics division. This strategic move is poised to bolster SoftBank's footprint in the Artificial Intelligence sector, aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's ambitious vision for "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence, which he believes will drive groundbreaking evolution. The acquisition, pending global regulatory approval, also means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. This development underscores SoftBank's aggressive strategy to position itself at the forefront of the burgeoning AI industry through targeted investments and acquisitions, further solidifying its influence in the global technology landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement for the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to an "agreed upon line" in the Gaza Strip. Heralded as the "first Phase" of a peace deal to end the two-year conflict, the agreement was confirmed by regional sources, Hamas, and Qatari mediators, though procedural issues remain. This breakthrough follows intense negotiations and aims to facilitate the entry of aid and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement brings a glimmer of hope for an end to a war that has resulted in an immense human cost and widespread displacement.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a 20-point plan for peace in Gaza, endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which outlines an immediate ceasefire, hostage and prisoner exchanges, and a phased Israeli withdrawal. The plan proposes demilitarizing Gaza under independent monitors and establishing a "technocratic" Palestinian committee, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, to govern the territory. It also calls for extensive aid and economic development. While offering a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood" as an aspiration, the plan notably sidelines the Palestinian Authority and grants amnesty to Hamas members who disarm, leaving many questions about its long-term viability and implementation.</p>

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff dramatically revitalized Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, transforming it from a "persistently dangerous" school with dwindling enrollment into a thriving academic environment. A former high school debate coach, Honoroff integrated debate into every class across all grade levels and expanded the debate team. This innovative approach led to remarkable improvements: within a few years, test scores soared, with proficiency jumping to 60% in English and 70% in math, and enrollment increased. The school's debate team even achieved national championship status, demonstrating the profound impact of this educational initiative on student success and community pride.</p>

          <h2>Tropical Storm Priscilla Weakens Off Mexico's Pacific Coast</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm off Mexico's Pacific coast, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. The storm, which developed over the weekend, is bringing high surf conditions and gusty winds to Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect. Forecasters anticipate further weakening over the next 48 hours as Priscilla continues to move parallel to the coast, remaining offshore. Despite its weakening, large swells generated by Priscilla are still expected to cause life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding along parts of Mexico's southwestern and west-central coasts, as well as southern Baja California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard a case challenging an Illinois voting regulation that allows mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day, even from a candidate who won. Representative Michael Bost, a Republican, argued he was harmed by a reduced margin of victory and extended staffing costs. However, both conservative and liberal justices expressed skepticism, questioning the standing of a winning candidate to claim harm and criticizing the lack of specific facts in Bost's brief. The justices also challenged the state's argument that only candidates with a realistic chance of winning should be able to sue, highlighting the complexities of election law and judicial review.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday, his second exam there since April. The White House confirmed the visit, stating he would also meet and speak with troops. This checkup follows an April exam that declared him "fully fit" and a July diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults that causes leg swelling. Recent public images of bruising on his hand, attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, had fueled speculation about his health. Trump's health has been a subject of public scrutiny and speculation throughout his presidency.</p>

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner lauded defender Maya Le Tissier as a "rock" after her match-winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut, fueling debate over her potential inclusion in England's starting lineup. Despite her consistent performance as a central defender, making a record 71 consecutive WSL appearances and leading United's defense, Le Tissier has only eight international caps. With injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze, many believe the 23-year-old's exceptional form and versatility warrant a greater role for the Lionesses. Skinner expressed confidence in her ability, stating she will be an "incredible England stalwart" when given the opportunity.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project during their meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of broader trade discussions, including U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations due to environmental concerns, was abandoned by its owner, TC Energy, after permits were canceled. While the conversation was preliminary, both leaders instructed their teams to continue discussions, signaling a potential new push for the controversial pipeline, despite past setbacks and ongoing opposition.</p>

Intrator emphasized that large technology companies are purchasing this infrastructure to deliver services to their clients, dismissing the "circular investment" narrative as a temporary market perception.
