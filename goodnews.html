          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House to discuss economic developments, emphasizing that monetary policy decisions would be based on careful, objective, and non-political analysis. The meeting occurred amidst Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to lower interest rates, using his Truth Social platform to pressure the FOMC. Powell had previously stated he would not initiate a meeting with the president. Markets largely expect the Fed to hold steady on rates until there is more clarity on tariff uncertainty, with futures market pricing indicating rate cuts may not resume until at least September. The Fed remains committed to its dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Atlantic suggests several books to combat boredom, including Alexander Chee's "The Queen of the Night," Peter Cornell's "The Ways of Paradise," Bae Suah's "Untold Night and Day," Simone de Beauvoir's "America Day by Day," and Lydia Sandgren's "Collected Works." These books offer various escapes from monotony through immersive storytelling, intriguing facts, surreal narratives, and complex character studies. "The Queen of the Night" provides high drama, while "The Ways of Paradise" delves into occult murmurs. "Untold Night and Day" offers a detective novel with a poetic twist, and "America Day by Day" chronicles de Beauvoir's journey through the United States. "Collected Works" is a reverse bildungsroman with a central mystery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction to allow Harvard University to continue enrolling international students, halting the Trump administration's efforts to ban the practice. The decision comes after the same judge granted a temporary restraining order last Friday. Harvard has nearly 7,000 international students, comprising more than a quarter of its student body, and their tuition represents a crucial financial lifeline for the university. The judge's decision provides temporary relief for international students, although the situation remains part of a larger, ongoing process. The ruling helps to stabilize a potentially volatile situation.</p>
