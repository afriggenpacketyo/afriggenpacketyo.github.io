          <p>This article presents a visual collection of Pride Month celebrations from various cities around the world, including Washington, D.C., and Kathmandu. It highlights the history of Pride, which originated from the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment in the LGBTQ rights movement. The images showcase the vibrant parades and festivals that serve as both a celebration of the LGBTQ community and a continuing protest for equal rights and inclusion.

          <p>As Wimbledon begins, British men's number one Jack Draper is embracing the responsibility of leading the home nation's charge in the post-Andy Murray era. Ranked fourth in the world, Draper has emerged as a serious contender and is the highest-seeded British player since Murray in 2017. Meanwhile, Emma Raducanu, who famously won the US Open in 2021, stated she is not "expecting much" as she prepares for her opening match. This year's tournament features 23 British players in the singles draws, the largest contingent since 1984.</p>

          <p>Smriti Mandhana delivered a masterful performance, scoring her first T20 international century to lead India to a dominant 97-run victory over England. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. In response, England's batting lineup faltered, collapsing to 113 all out despite a resilient 66 from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt. The comprehensive loss marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and highlights areas for improvement early in the five-match series.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and risking fines in a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's administration. The march was outlawed under a new law that prohibits events deemed to "promote" homosexuality to minors, which Orbán's party passed in March. Despite the legal threats, organizers and Budapest's mayor proceeded with the event, framing it as a stand for both LGBTQ+ rights and broader democratic freedoms in Hungary. The demonstration drew large crowds and international support.</p>

          <p>The Getty Villa museum in Pacific Palisades, California, has reopened to the public after being closed for nearly six months following the destructive Palisades fire in January.

The company stated that the majority of its products, like Uncrustables, are already free of synthetic dyes. This move aligns Smucker with other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar pledges amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial food additives.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their Australian tour with a decisive victory over the Western Force, but the win was overshadowed by an injury to a key player. Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a hamstring injury, creating concern for the team's depth in that position. Coach Andy Farrell noted the team's high penalty count in the first half but was pleased with their ambitious, attacking style of play. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a standout, positioning him as a contender for a starting role in the upcoming Test series.</p>

The commission will examine the scientific advisory process, coordination between federal and state governments, and the pandemic's social and economic impacts.</p>

That decision prompted other G7 ambassadors to withdraw from last year's event in solidarity.
