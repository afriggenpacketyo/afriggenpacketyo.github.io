          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, praising graduates as the first of America's "golden age" and emphasizing his administration's commitment to national security and border protection. He touted accomplishments like the "Golden Dome" missile defense system and criticized past administrations for involving the military in nation-building efforts. Trump also highlighted his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, stating there would be no more critical race theory or transgender policies imposed on the military. The speech sparked controversy, with critics arguing these changes undermine the values and education of military academies.</p>

          <p>President Trump used his West Point commencement address to congratulate cadets and claim credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He detailed a shift in foreign policy away from "nation-building crusades" and touted the elimination of critical race theory from military academies. Trump also asserted that his administration achieved a new peacetime recruiting record. While military records show enlistments rebounding before his term, Trump emphasized focusing the military on crushing adversaries and defending America. The speech underscored the administration's emphasis on military strength and a departure from previous foreign policy approaches.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris expressed his satisfaction with securing pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix, calling it a significant step in the right direction after feeling unhappy with his performance earlier in the season. He emphasized the importance of consistency and aims to maintain this level of performance in upcoming races. Norris beat Charles Leclerc by a narrow margin in a qualifying session where pole position changed hands multiple times. He attributed his improvement to a combination of car adjustments, the unique demands of the Monaco circuit, and his efforts to drive in a smarter, more committed way.</p>

The anomaly of Watson's name not appearing on the official programme due to his recent transfer only adds to the fairytale nature of his match-winning contribution.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival.

Despite the disruption, organizers of the international film festival confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to an alternative power supply.

          <p>Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant victory for a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for over 15 years. Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who was previously imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. The win continues Neon's unprecedented streak of backing the last six Palme d'Or winners. The ceremony followed a major power outage in southeastern France, suspected to be arson, but power was restored just hours before the event.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of California in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The high-definition pictures were taken using cutting-edge deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition earlier this year. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship during training exercises and was lost for nearly 60 years until it was located in 1972. The new images provide detailed views of the submarine's wreckage and the marine life that has colonized it over the years.</p>
