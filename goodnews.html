The new office will formalize a presence that has existed since 2017 and will oversee partnerships in New Zealand, Antarctica, and several Pacific Island nations.

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal that sets a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports, including automobiles, avoiding a threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for Korean companies to enter the U.S. market in sectors like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the deal provides some stability, interpretations of the investment fund differ between the two nations. The agreement notably excludes further concessions on sensitive agricultural products like beef and rice, which was a key objective for Seoul. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law, AB 379, allows prosecutors to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. This "wobbler" provision gives prosecutors discretion and targets older perpetrators while avoiding felony charges for all younger offenders. The bill faced opposition from some Democrats who raised concerns about potential profiling and its impact on victims, but was ultimately passed after amendments were made.</p>

In a public statement, Harris explained that after careful reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris indicate she felt her impact could be greater on a national stage and that the decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, generated tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. The event prompted tsunami warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan, though these were later downgraded to advisories as the risk of major inundation subsided in many areas. While the Russian coast experienced flooding and some minor damage was reported elsewhere, widespread catastrophe was averted. However, several South American countries issued new or upgraded warnings, indicating the event's far-reaching and prolonged effects.</p>

In other key moves, the New York Mets added relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley, while the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates. The flurry of activity signals a heated market for relief pitching as teams position themselves for the postseason stretch.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution, civil rights violations, and defamation, claiming he was targeted for political or professional gain. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice, allowing Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile. An attorney for Baldwin stated they have been in settlement discussions and will refile if a favorable resolution is not reached, characterizing the dismissal as a procedural step.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would avoid the costly and disruptive process of diverting the M25 motorway. The company argues its proposal, with a cost estimate under £25 billion, presents a lower-risk and more cost-effective solution for increasing the airport's capacity. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated expansion project.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings. The company's revenue surged 45% year-over-year to $989 million, while the number of funded customers grew by 2.3 million to 26.5 million. Growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equity and cryptocurrency markets, with total platform assets nearly doubling to $279 billion. The positive performance reflects the company's aggressive expansion from retail trading into broader wealth management services, including a significant increase in Robinhood Gold subscribers.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, alleviating initial concerns of a more serious injury. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound before being removed, but he remained in the game as the designated hitter. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, with their only scoring coming from a two-run homer by Freddie Freeman. Ohtani, who is still building up his pitch count after returning from surgery, is expected to make his next scheduled start.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia that triggered tsunami alerts, this article explains the science of how these powerful waves are generated and what to do in an event. Tsunamis are typically caused by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that create vertical movement on the seafloor, displacing a massive volume of water. The resulting waves can travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean before slowing and growing in height as they approach the coast. Experts emphasize that even small tsunamis are dangerous and advise immediately moving to higher ground, at least 100 feet above sea level, upon receiving a warning.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed thriving communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team observed abundant ecosystems fueled by chemical seepage from the Earth's crust, including beds of clams, bacterial mats, and fields of tube worms. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme high-pressure, pitch-black environments. The discovery suggests that such chemosynthetic communities may be more widespread in the planet's deepest trenches than previously believed, opening new avenues for scientific research.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue that conclusive evidence is lacking. While many studies link screens to negative outcomes, some researchers point out flaws in the data, such as reliance on self-reporting and a failure to distinguish between different types of screen use. They argue that the term "screen time" is too broad and that the focus should be on specific online harms rather than general usage.

The high-resolution scans revealed intricate designs of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures on the woman from the ancient Pazyryk culture, showcasing a level of sophistication that would challenge a modern tattooist. Researchers worked with a specialist in ancient tattooing techniques to analyze the images, concluding that the decorations were likely stenciled and applied with multi-pointed tools.

After re-signing with the Rams on a one-year deal, Witherspoon noted the team's decision not to add new cornerbacks or safeties as a vote of confidence in the existing personnel.
