          <p>Meta's shares increased by over 10% following the release of its second-quarter earnings report, which surpassed analyst predictions for revenue and provided a strong third-quarter forecast. The company's sales grew 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, driven by a significant increase in advertising revenue attributed to advancements in its AI systems. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the company's major investments in AI, including a partnership with Scale AI, as central to its strategy for developing "personal superintelligence." Despite these gains, the Reality Labs division continued to operate at a substantial loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft's stock saw an 8% increase after the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, marking its fastest growth in over three years. The company's Intelligent Cloud division was a key driver, with revenue from its Azure platform and other cloud services growing 39% and topping $75 billion for the fiscal year. Microsoft's significant investments in artificial intelligence, including its partnership with OpenAI, have boosted sales of its commercial products like the Microsoft 365 Copilot.

          <p>Trading platform Robinhood reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it saw significant growth in funded customers and total platform assets, which nearly doubled to $279 billion. This strong performance has been driven by net deposits and higher valuations in equity and cryptocurrency markets, along with growth in its Robinhood Gold subscription service. The results reflect the company's successful expansion into broader wealth management services, positioning it as a strong competitor to established brokerage firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state this September, following similar declarations by the UK and France. The recognition is contingent on several conditions, including the Palestinian Authority committing to significant governance reforms and holding elections in 2026 without the participation of Hamas. Carney stated that the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements have made the traditional negotiated two-state solution "no longer tenable." The move comes amid increasing domestic pressure on the Canadian government to take a more definitive stance on the issue.</p>

          <h2>Highlighting Independent Latin Artists Who Merit Grammy Consideration</h2>

          <p>This article makes a case for several independent and avant-garde Latin artists who deserve recognition at the upcoming Latin Grammy Awards, arguing that their innovative work is often overlooked. It profiles six musicians, including Argentine digital artist Juana Aguirre, Chilean singer-songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti, whose recent albums have pushed creative boundaries. The piece suggests that while major commercial acts dominate the nominations, the Latin Academy should celebrate these artists for their progressive fusion of folk, electronic, jazz, and rock influences. The article champions their unique contributions to the evolution of Latin music.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains High Interest Rates Amid Presidential Pressure for Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:14:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining it at a two-decade high to continue its fight against inflation. This decision comes despite persistent public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for significant rate cuts to ease borrowing costs for consumers and the government. Fed officials are remaining cautious as inflation, while down from its peak, is still above their 2% target, and the broader economy continues to show signs of resilience. The central bank's stance highlights its independence and data-driven approach in the face of political criticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it earlier due to uncertainty surrounding U.S. auto tariffs. The updated outlook includes an estimated $2 billion net negative impact from these tariffs, which is a significant factor in its projected earnings. For the second quarter, the automaker reported revenue that beat analyst expectations, though its net income was affected by special charges related to a vehicle recall. The company's "Pro" commercial vehicle division continues to be a major growth driver, while its "Model e" electric vehicle unit sustained a substantial loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Senate committee has voted to advance legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined with committee Democrats in an 8-7 vote to move the bill, now called the Honest Act, forward for a potential full Senate vote. The proposed law would require lawmakers to divest their individual stock holdings and would be more restrictive than the current STOCK Act. The move reflects growing public pressure for stricter ethical standards to prevent potential conflicts of interest, though it has also sparked debate within the Republican party.
