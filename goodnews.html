          <p>Senior Chinese officials recently toured different regions of the country, highlighting key national priorities. In the eastern province of Zhejiang, Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing stressed the importance of integrating new technologies like artificial intelligence into manufacturing to create 'new quality productive forces'. He urged specialized firms to increase research and development investment in areas such as solid-state batteries and large language models. This focus on high-tech development contrasts with concurrent efforts to address poverty and public health issues in other parts of the nation, reflecting a dual approach to national progress.</p>

          <p>The Koreshan Unity, a utopian communal group led by Cyrus Teed, relocated from Chicago to Estero, Florida, in the late 1800s to establish a "New Jerusalem." Teed, who had a divine vision that the universe existed within a hollow Earth, gathered a following of educated and cultured individuals. In Florida, they built a self-sufficient town with a sawmill, publishing house, and orchestra, but their ambitious plan to incorporate a 110-square-mile city eventually failed. After Teed's death in 1908, the community dwindled, with the last member donating the core settlement's land to the state, now preserved as Koreshan State Historic Site.</p>

          <p>China is undertaking one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse extreme terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost zones, at an average altitude of over 4,500 meters. The total investment could reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it more costly than the still-under-construction Sichuan-Tibet Railway. A state-owned company has been established to build and operate the line, which is seen as a significant engineering feat and a key strategic development for Beijing.</p>

          <p>The European Union has started the gradual implementation of its new digital border control, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, on their first use. This registration will be valid for three years. While EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns have been raised about potential delays during the initial rollout at key transit points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals, which are phasing in the system over the next several months.</p>

The party endorsed a proposal to establish a "standing commission" to engage the public on Wales's constitutional future and prepare a white paper on independence. This marks a shift from a previous pledge to hold an independence referendum within five years. The new strategy focuses on a longer-term national debate, building on the work of a previous government commission that explored enhanced devolution and independence as viable options.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to lead the team to the World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the disappointment of their 2022 play-off loss to Ukraine. Scotland is currently well-positioned in their qualifying group, level on points with leaders Denmark, ahead of a crucial match against Belarus. Clarke, who has already guided Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, is focused on ending the nation's 28-year absence from the men's World Cup. A victory against Belarus could secure at least a play-off spot, keeping their qualification hopes firmly alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein formalizing the right for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays sparked a public debate fueled by misleading media headlines. Contrary to claims of "extra holidays," the policy merely affirms a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom, similar to provisions for Catholic and Protestant holidays in various German states. The regulation allows Muslims to be excused without pay for the first day of Ramadan and Eid al-Adha, aligning their rights with those of other religious groups in Germany's federalized system of public holidays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the genetic process that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. The research, published in the journal Cell, identifies two key genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state, a phenomenon known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The breakthrough provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for plant science and agriculture.</p>

          <p>The recent summer transfer window saw several top Premier League clubs, including Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester United, invest heavily in new strikers to bolster their attacking options. This article reviews the early-season performance of nine of these big-name forwards, such as Liverpool's dual acquisitions Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike, and Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres. While some, like Gyokeres, have integrated well and contributed vital goals for their new teams, others have had a slower start. The analysis examines their statistics, including goals, assists, and minutes played, to assess their initial impact in the league.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her personal journey of understanding medical body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, announced her decision to donate her body to science. Initially shocked, Owen produced a documentary at Cardiff University's anatomy centre to learn about the process, discovering how donated bodies serve as "silent teachers" for medical students. The article highlights the profound educational value of real human anatomy and the emotional experience for donor families, who may wait up to three years for the return of their loved one's remains for a funeral. Inspired by her mother's altruism, Owen has also decided to register as a body donor.</p>

          <p>Former England midfielder Fran Kirby has opened up about her challenging journey back to professional football after being diagnosed with pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the heart. The condition, which caused extreme chest pain and fatigue, led her to collapse in 2019 and sidelined her for ten months, making her contemplate retirement. Kirby credits the support from her former club, Chelsea, with helping her through a difficult recovery that involved strong medication and significant lifestyle adjustments. Now playing for Brighton, she has a renewed appreciation for her health and takes a more cautious approach to rest and recovery to manage her condition.</p>

          <p>Despite being the all-time leading goalscorer for both England and Tottenham Hotspur, questions persist about whether striker Harry Kane is fully appreciated. Now at Bayern Munich, the 32-year-old continues his prolific scoring, recently becoming the fastest player to reach 100 goals for a single club in Europe's top leagues. While some critics point to a lack of major tournament victories with England, pundits argue his all-around play, consistency, and leadership make him one of the world's elite players. His understated personality, in contrast to other global superstars, may contribute to the perception that his remarkable achievements are sometimes undervalued.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in loans from China's Exim Bank, used to finance its Standard Gauge Railway, from U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan. The move is expected to save the country US$215 million annually in debt-servicing costs by potentially halving the interest rate from its current 6.37%. As of June 2024, Kenya still owed about US$3.5 billion on the loans. Analysts suggest this debt restructuring could serve as a model for other debt-distressed African nations and may strengthen their financial ties with China, offering an alternative to dollar-denominated debt.</p>
