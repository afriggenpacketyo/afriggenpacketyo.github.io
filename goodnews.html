        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why German footballers have not won the prestigious Ballon d'Or award in nearly 30 years, despite their country's and clubs' significant team successes. The analysis points to a historical shift in the award favoring attacking players, a category where Germany has not consistently produced world-class talent compared to other nations or its own past. It highlights how even exceptional German goalkeepers like Manuel Neuer only reached third place, often overshadowed by eras dominated by players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The article concludes by identifying young German attackers like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz as potential future contenders, suggesting a new era might offer them a chance.</p>

It highlights the growing importance of digital archiving for accountability, transparency, and historical preservation in an era of constantly changing online information. The article details four popular tools: the Wayback Machine, Archive.today, Perma.cc, and The Ghostarchive, outlining their pros and cons. It emphasizes that while archiving is crucial, technical and legal challenges mean not all content can be preserved, but the internet's memory can still be leveraged to find past versions of websites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee expressed a cautious stance on lowering interest rates, despite voting for a recent cut, due to ongoing concerns about slower economic growth and a weaker labor market. He indicated that future rate adjustments would be contingent on economic progress and a return of inflation to the Fed's 2% target. Goolsbee suggested that while rates could eventually come down, an overly aggressive approach is unwarranted given inflation has remained above target for over four years. The article notes the FOMC's projection for further gradual cuts this year and next, with the labor market showing stability despite softening hiring trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England has named its 16-man squad for the Ashes 2025 series against Australia, featuring a surprise recall for Will Jacks as the back-up spinner and Harry Brook replacing Ollie Pope as vice-captain. Jacks' inclusion ahead of other contenders provides flexibility, while Brook's elevation hints at a potential challenge to Pope's number three batting position. The squad includes a strong pace-bowling department with Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, and Josh Tongue, despite Wood's recent injury concerns. The article highlights England's strategy to rely on pace and bounce for success in Australian conditions, with hopes for captain Ben Stokes' full recovery from a shoulder injury.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced plans to launch its Artemis II mission, the first crewed trip around the Moon in 50 years, as early as February, ahead of its previous April deadline. This ten-day mission will send four astronauts to test the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft systems in preparation for a lunar landing as early as 2027. The crew will not land on the Moon but will travel beyond low Earth orbit, conducting experiments to monitor the effects of space on their bodies. Despite the ambitious timeline, independent experts express optimism but caution that the 2027 landing goal remains highly optimistic due to challenges with associated technologies like SpaceX's Starship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent legislation temporarily raised the federal deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025, offering significant tax benefits, particularly in high-tax states. A Redfin report indicates New York, California, and New Jersey residents could see the largest median savings, while states like South Dakota and Alaska would experience the smallest.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, has dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area, capable of disrupting cellphone services and posing a threat to the UN General Assembly. Investigators discovered over 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards across multiple sites, which could have sent millions of text messages per minute and disabled cell towers, potentially blocking emergency communications. Early analysis suggests the network facilitated communications between foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and human trafficking rings. While the immediate threat to the UNGA has been neutralized, officials believe other such networks may exist, and a criminal investigation is ongoing.</p>
