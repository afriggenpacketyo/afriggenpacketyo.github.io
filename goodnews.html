          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping has approved a deal designed to allow the social media app TikTok to continue its operations within the United States. Speaking to reporters, Trump indicated that the approval from Xi was a significant step, though he suggested that the final signing of the agreement might still be a formality. The statement followed what Trump described as a "productive call" with the Chinese president, covering a range of topics. This development marks a potential resolution to the long-standing national security concerns surrounding the popular video-sharing platform's ownership and data practices.</p>

          <p>Navan, a startup specializing in corporate travel and expense management, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "NAVN." The company's S-1 filing reveals a trailing 12-month revenue of $613 million, a 32% increase, and gross bookings of $7.6 billion. Formerly known as TripActions, Navan positions itself as an all-in-one "super app" for business travel, serving over 10,000 customers including major corporations like Unilever and Adobe. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen its most active year since the 2021 boom, with many high-profile tech and fintech companies going public.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, a deal that would value the company at an immense $200 billion. This fundraising effort reflects the soaring valuations in the AI sector, with competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI also securing massive investments at high valuations. Although Musk later posted on his social media platform X calling the report "fake news," the potential funding would likely be used to acquire vast numbers of AI chips and build out the necessary data center infrastructure. The company is developing its Grok chatbot to compete with established models from OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>

Despite a dominant warm-up victory, England narrowly defeated France 43-42 in the Six Nations, suggesting a competitive match is expected.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note yield climbing to its highest level in two weeks, despite the Federal Reserve implementing its first interest rate cut of the year. The 10-year yield increased to 4.127%, a counterintuitive move as investors weigh strong economic signals against the Fed's monetary easing. Analysts suggest the rise in longer-dated yields reflects expectations of solid GDP growth and slightly higher inflation, rather than just future short-term rates. The market is also digesting recent data showing fewer jobless claims, which has calmed fears of a significant economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team delivered a stunning performance, defeating the six-time and defending champion New Zealand Black Ferns to secure a place in the World Cup final. The decisive victory marks New Zealand's first loss in the tournament in 11 years and only the second time Canada has reached the final. Canada dominated the match from the start, building a substantial lead and ultimately winning 34-19 in front of a large crowd in Bristol.

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly clarified that he does not collaborate with minority owner Tom Brady on weekly game plans, contrary to a recent ESPN report. Kelly explained that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource for general football strategy and insights, particularly regarding defensive schemes, their discussions are not part of the team's regular game-planning process. Head coach Pete Carroll also refuted the report, stating his conversations with Brady are more general in nature. The NFL has confirmed that there are no policies prohibiting an owner from sitting in the coaches' booth, as Brady was seen doing during a recent game.</p>

Founded in 2013, Pattern helps over 200 brands, including Nestle and Panasonic, optimize their sales on major online marketplaces. The successful IPO comes as the market for tech offerings has rebounded, though the company noted in its prospectus that its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform and uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy are significant risks.</p>

          <p>MicroStrategy's executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has predicted that Bitcoin will ultimately supplant the S&P 500 as the primary standard for long-term wealth preservation. In a recent interview, he classified Bitcoin among "the great property assets" of history, arguing its lack of cash flows makes it "perfect money." Saylor projects that Bitcoin's value will appreciate faster than the S&P 500 indefinitely, allowing it to serve as collateral for a new generation of digital credit instruments. He believes this will create a gateway for massive capital investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem from traditional finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Wolfe Research forecast predicts a significant increase in U.S. electricity demand, driven largely by the power requirements of new AI data centers. The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates, creating a bullish outlook for industrial companies. This trend is expected to benefit firms like GE Vernova, which produces power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which manufactures essential electrical equipment for the grid and data centers. The strong demand and limited production capacity may also sustain favorable pricing and profitability for these key suppliers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The construction of a new, privately funded ballroom at the White House, championed by President Trump, is being supported by millions of dollars in donations from major corporations and individuals. Companies such as Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir have pledged $5 million or more to the projected $200 million project. In exchange for their contributions, donors may have their names permanently etched inside the structure, although a final decision on the form of recognition is still pending.

Since the cathedral's main structure reopened in December 2024, it has attracted nearly 30,000 visitors daily.

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The provision, part of recent legislation, allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, but key details on eligibility have been pending. The new guidance confirms that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and legal services, will not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, the agencies specified that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several relatively inexpensive options for borrowing money. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) currently offers one of the lowest average rates at 8.05%, making it more affordable than home equity loans, personal loans, and especially credit cards. Home equity loans provide the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans offer an unsecured option that does not put a borrower's home at risk as collateral. The cooling interest rate environment may make variable-rate products like HELOCs even more attractive if the downward trend in rates continues. (not investment advice)</p>
