          <p>President Xi Jinping hosted a commemorative gala at the Great Hall of the People, marking the 80th anniversary of China's victory in World War II. This event, held after a significant military parade, strongly reinforced the Communist Party's official narrative regarding the 14-year struggle against Japanese aggression and its ultimate triumph. Xi, alongside Politburo members, personally greeted several surviving Chinese WWII veterans, emphasizing national remembrance and unity. The gala, titled 'Justice Will Prevail,' showcased a blend of song, dance, poetry, and drama, further solidifying the nation's historical perspective on this pivotal conflict.</p>

          <p>Alphabet stock surged 9% after Google largely prevailed in a significant antitrust case, avoiding the U.S. Department of Justice's proposed breakup, which included divesting its Chrome browser. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected the most severe remedies. The company can continue paying Apple billions to be the default search engine on iPhones and will not have to divest Android. This ruling is seen as a major win for Google, removing a significant overhang and bolstering confidence in its long-term search business and AI initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York judge has approved the use of cutting-edge advanced DNA testing in the upcoming trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, marking a first for the state's courts. This ruling allows whole genome sequencing to extract DNA from degraded samples, linking Heuermann, his ex-wife, and daughter to hair strands found on victims. The defense challenged the method's accuracy and the lab's licensing, but prosecutors view it as a major victory. This development could revolutionize forensic science, potentially linking Heuermann to more killings and setting a significant precedent for future cases.</p>

          <p>Netflix has updated its "Moments" feature, allowing mobile users to customize and share specific clips from shows, coinciding with the release of "Wednesday" season two. This enhancement enables viewers to select start and end points for segments, which are then saved to their "My Netflix" tab for easy rewatching or sharing. The move aims to capitalize on viral content, following the success of the "Wednesday" dance scene. This update is part of Netflix's broader strategy to revamp its brand, including a redesigned homepage and a TikTok-like vertical video feed, to boost user engagement and combat stagnation.</p>

The 22-year-old, with only a year left on her contract and no renewal, has attracted interest from several clubs. As part of related dealings, England midfielder Jess Park is expected to move from City to United, undergoing a medical. United aims to capitalize on Clinton's transfer value rather than losing her for free next year, having previously experienced similar situations with other key players.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company will pay $10 million to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it facilitated the unlawful collection of personal data from children viewing child-directed content on YouTube. The FTC claimed Disney failed to properly label some videos as "made for kids," allowing data collection for targeted advertising without parental consent, violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule. The settlement mandates a civil penalty and requires Disney to implement a program to review YouTube video designations. Disney stated the settlement is limited to YouTube content and reaffirms its commitment to children's privacy.</p>

Both options are subject to significant federal and state taxes, with the federal government taking 24% off the top of the lump sum.

          <p>"Phantom energy," also known as vampire energy, refers to the electricity consumed by devices when they are plugged in but not actively in use. This hidden drain accounts for 5% to 10% of home energy use, contributing to climate change by increasing demand for planet-warming power sources. Appliances like internet-connected smart TVs can consume significantly more standby power than regular ones. Experts recommend unplugging chargers and unused appliances, or disabling unnecessary smart features, as small steps that collectively reduce emissions and save money, influencing broader sustainable behaviors.</p>

          <p>A fact check debunks President Donald Trump's repeated claims that Democrat-governed cities inherently experience higher crime rates. Data analysis reveals that while most large U.S. cities are Democrat-led and urban areas generally report more crime, this correlation does not imply causation. Harvard, MIT, and Boston University research spanning three decades found no detectable impact of a mayor's political affiliation on crime rates or policing. Despite public perception, national violent crime decreased by an estimated 4.5% in 2024, emphasizing that complex socioeconomic factors, not party affiliation, influence crime trends.</p>
