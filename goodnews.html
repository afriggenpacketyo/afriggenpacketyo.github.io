          <p>Robinhood's stock reached an all-time high after the company announced it would offer tokenized shares of private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX, to its users in the European Union. This initiative, part of a broader global crypto expansion, makes private equity accessible on the blockchain for the first time through the platform. The tokenized assets are available on Robinhood's EU crypto app, allowing 24/5 trading. Due to different regulatory environments, this offering is not yet available to U.S. customers, who will instead gain access to crypto staking for ethereum and solana. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a high-level economic meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping underscored the strategic importance of creating a "unified national market." This policy prioritizes strengthening domestic demand as China faces a more challenging and uncertain global landscape. According to a state media readout, the plan also involves better integration of domestic and foreign trade, making it easier for export-oriented products to be sold within China. The move signals a continued focus on economic self-reliance and stability while remaining open to international commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Citigroup analysis of U.S. credit card data reveals a decline in spending on most luxury goods during the first five months of 2025 compared to the previous year. However, the jewelry category has been a notable exception, consistently outperforming other sectors like leather goods and apparel. In May, luxury jewelry spending surged over 10% year-over-year, and it was the only category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this resilience is due to jewelry's perceived value as an investment and its sentimental worth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 324 individuals, including 93 medical professionals, in what it calls the largest healthcare fraud enforcement action in its history. The schemes collectively sought to defraud federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid of $14.6 billion, with actual losses amounting to about $2.9 billion. Some of the complex operations were run by transnational criminal organizations that used stolen American identities to submit fraudulent claims for medical supplies. The operation resulted in the seizure of over $245 million in cash and assets from the accused parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the differences between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke, providing guidance for emergency situations. Heat exhaustion is a less severe illness with symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and can be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. However, if left untreated, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition where the body's temperature regulation system fails, potentially causing body temperatures to rise to 41¬∞C (106¬∞F) and requiring immediate emergency medical attention. The best prevention is to stay hydrated and avoid midday sun.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A previously unknown novel by the acclaimed German journalist and historian Sebastian Haffner has become an instant bestseller nearly a century after it was written. Titled "Parting" ("Abschied"), the autobiographical love story was penned in 1932 when Haffner was a 24-year-old law trainee witnessing the rise of fascism. The manuscript was discovered by his son after Haffner's death in 1999 but was only published recently. The book captures a sense of hope and youthful freedom against the backdrop of the impending doom of the Nazi era, offering a different perspective on the author.</p>

          <p>An image circulating on social media platform X purports to show the aftermath of an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute. However, a DW fact-check reveals the claim is false. A reverse image search and comparison with satellite data from Maxar Technologies confirm the photo actually depicts an Iranian missile base in Tabriz that was damaged by an Israeli attack. The Weizmann Institute, which was a target in Iran's retaliatory strikes, is located in a different, more densely built area. This incident highlights the ongoing spread of misinformation related to the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>

          <h2>Essay: The Overlooked Power of Protest Is Its Ability to Break the 'Spiral of Silence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay argues that a key function of political protest is to combat the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. This silence can be misinterpreted as approval of the status quo, reinforcing the spiral. Public demonstrations, like those after the Dobbs Supreme Court ruling, can correct these misperceptions by providing a visible signal of collective opinion. By creating "common knowledge" where people see dissent and see others seeing it too, protests can reveal the true extent of public sentiment.</p>

          <p>A new law in Denmark has come into effect that requires women, alongside men, to be subject to military conscription when they turn 18. Under the new rules, women will be included in a lottery system that selects individuals for an 11-month period of military service, an increase from the previous four-month term. While women could previously volunteer, they are now required to register for potential service. The change, which follows similar moves by Norway and Sweden, is part of Denmark's effort to boost its defense capabilities and meet NATO spending targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has requested that some of the California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles be reassigned to help fight wildfires. The deployment of roughly 4,000 Guard members was ordered by the Trump administration to handle protests, a move Governor Gavin Newsom opposed. With California expecting an active wildfire season, the state had warned the deployment left its firefighting force at only 40% capacity. The proposal would see 200 Guard members returned to state control to be on standby for wildfire response, addressing concerns about the state's readiness.</p>
