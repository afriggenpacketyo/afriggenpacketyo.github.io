          <p>Xiaomi, known for its smartphone success by emulating leading brands, is now making strides in the electric vehicle market, a feat Apple has not accomplished. The company's new YU7 crossover is anticipated to rival Tesla's Model Y in China, while its SU7 has drawn comparisons to Porsche. Despite facing challenges like a recent fatal crash and subsequent government scrutiny of self-driving technology, Xiaomi's sales will be closely monitored to assess the impact on consumer confidence. Analysts emphasize the need for Xiaomi to expand its product portfolio and seek international growth amid fierce competition in China's EV market.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025 to 1.2%, with a further rise to 1.4% in 2026, citing an ongoing economic recovery. However, the IMF cautioned Chancellor Rachel Reeves to adhere to fiscal rules regarding tax and spending, and highlighted global trade tensions and persistent uncertainty as factors that could weigh down growth. The IMF praised the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investments, but warned of "difficult choices" to balance taxation with spending in the long term. Chancellor Reeves welcomed the report, emphasizing the government's commitment to trade deals to protect jobs and boost investment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is reportedly considering acquiring a "golden share" in United States Steel Corp. to retain veto power over key decisions as Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. plans to acquire the U.S. steelmaker. This move aims to alleviate national security concerns and potentially limit Nippon Steel's autonomy. President Donald Trump has indicated that U.S. Steel would remain under American control, even with the partnership, and ordered another review of the plans by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The original review, launched under the previous administration, did not reach a consensus.</p>

          <p>Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, have been identified in the United States, with initial cases dating back to late March. Symptoms associated with NB.1.8.1 are similar to previous strains, including respiratory issues and systemic effects like fever and fatigue, and data suggests it is more transmissible but not more severe. Despite high transmissibility, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to certain groups, requiring vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. Experts express concerns about potential public health impacts, including delayed access to boosters and reduced vaccination rates, while emphasizing the importance of hygiene practices and mask-wearing for prevention.</p>

          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, reflecting Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. While India surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in March, analysts expect this growth to slow due to manufacturing capacity limitations. Protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing could also curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity, with Trump threatening tariffs on all iPhone shipments if they are not manufactured domestically.

          <p>Recent data suggests that Gen Z is divided into two distinct groups: "Old Gen Z" (ages 25-29), who are more Democratic and progressive, and "Young Gen Z" (ages 18-24), who are more open to Trump and skeptical of the status quo. Polling data indicates that Young Gen Z holds more favorable views of Republicans and Trump compared to Old Gen Z. Younger members of Gen Z also exhibit more conservative views on policy issues and are more likely to identify with a religion, which correlates with Republican affiliation. The article discusses the potential implications of this split for future elections, challenging the notion of a consistently progressive younger electorate.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions board is considering implementing a "golden point" extra time proposal for a drawn deciding third Test against Australia this summer. Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the change to ensure a definitive result, aiming to enhance fan engagement. The "golden point" format, where the first team to score wins, is already used in Super Rugby Pacific for regular season games, though knockout games use standard extra time periods before resorting to a golden point. In 2017, the Lions and New Zealand shared the series after a drawn third Test, leading to calls for a more decisive outcome.</p>

          <p>Following a car ramming incident in Liverpool, the Merseyside Police promptly released details about the driver, a 53-year-old white British man, to prevent the spread of misinformation. This decision contrasts with the aftermath of a stabbing in Southport last summer, where a lack of information led to false anti-Muslim speculation and subsequent riots. The police's swift action aimed to control the narrative and avoid the harmful consequences of unchecked rumors. However, some experts raise concerns about potential challenges in future cases where the suspect's background may be more sensitive.</p>
