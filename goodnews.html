The director, Isaiah Saxon, drew inspiration from his upbringing in California, where there was a divide between those who want to live symbiotically with nature and those who want to use force against it.

          <p>Hearing aids are becoming more accessible and advanced, with new options like Nuance glasses that double as hearing aids. These devices are more affordable than traditional prescription hearing aids and appeal to a wider audience. The use of personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) and accessibility settings in devices like AirPods Pro is also increasing, promoting earlier engagement in hearing care. This is important as sensory input is vital to our existence and how we connect with other people.</p>
