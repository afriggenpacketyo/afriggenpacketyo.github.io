          <p>Taylor Frankie Paul, the star of "Secret Lives of Mormon Wives" and the next "Bachelorette," is publicly discussing how she will approach the show's controversial fantasy suite dates while respecting her Mormon background. In a recent podcast appearance, Paul emphasized the importance of physical compatibility in a marriage but suggested she would feel disrespectful being intimate with multiple contestants. She expressed that growing up in the Mormon Church, where sex is a taboo subject, has instilled a sense of guilt, but she is now trying to reconcile those values with the realities of the dating show's format as she moves into the public spotlight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The bill includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for officials to conceal information or mislead inquiries, aiming to prevent cover-ups like those seen after the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster. Campaigners, including families of the 97 victims, have welcomed the news, seeing it as a landmark step toward accountability. The legislation is intended to apply to future tragedies, learning lessons from scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon affair.</p>

          <p>The introduction of the "Hillsborough Law" marks a pivotal moment in a decades-long fight for justice by the families of the 97 people who died in the 1989 stadium disaster. This article explains that the law was born from the injustices exposed during the protracted inquests, which revealed a culture of institutional defensiveness and a lack of accountability. The legislation aims to enforce a "duty of candour" on public officials and ensure parity of legal funding for victims in state-related disasters. It represents a significant legacy for the Hillsborough campaigners, who hope it will prevent other families from enduring a similar struggle for truth.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The tool aims to simplify the shopping experience by distilling thousands of comments into concise clips, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions without cognitive overload. However, the feature raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific contexts found in human reviews, or if it might inadvertently flatten diverse opinions. While potentially beneficial for accessibility, critics worry it could blend marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially misleading consumers.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave jumped nearly 8% after revealing a substantial agreement with Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. Under the deal, Nvidia is obligated to purchase CoreWeave's residual unsold computing capacity through April 2032, signaling a deep strategic partnership. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, is a major customer for Nvidia's GPUs, renting them out to clients for AI workloads.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has announced plans to reduce the weighting of major issuers like China and India in its widely-tracked GBI-EM Global Diversified bond index. The bank will lower the maximum weight for any single country from 10% to 9%, a change that will be phased in during the first half of 2026. This adjustment is intended to decrease concentration risk and enhance diversification for investors, effectively redirecting investment flows toward smaller emerging markets. Consequently, countries such as Thailand, Poland, South Africa, and Brazil are expected to see their representation in the influential index increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, joining the exclusive ranks of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's shares surged more than 4% on Monday, pushing its valuation to $3.05 trillion. This milestone was propelled by a recent favorable antitrust ruling where the penalties were less severe than investors had feared, causing the stock to rally. Despite facing increased competition from AI challengers and intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's stock has gained over 30% this year, demonstrating significant investor confidence.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers its first interest rate cut since December 2024, this article explains its indirect but significant influence on mortgage rates. The Fed sets the short-term federal funds rate, but fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note. While a Fed cut doesn't guarantee an immediate drop in mortgage costs, lenders often price in anticipated changes, which is why rates have already slightly decreased. Ultimately, mortgage rates are affected by a combination of factors including inflation expectations, economic growth, and investor sentiment in the bond market. (not investment advice)</p>
