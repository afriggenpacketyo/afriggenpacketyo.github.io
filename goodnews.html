          <h2>UK Government Announces New Water Ombudsman to Address Consumer Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints regarding issues like leaks and incorrect billing. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and record levels of sewage discharge into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers, bringing the water industry's consumer protection in line with other utilities like energy and telecommunications.</p>

          <p>A pilot on a flight from Minneapolis to North Dakota reassured passengers after executing an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a military aircraft. In a video that went viral, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually in the area, failed to provide a heads-up about a B-52 bomber in the flight pattern. He apologized for the sudden and unsettling movement, stating that it was a necessary action taken by surprise to avert a converging course with the other plane. Skywest Airlines confirmed the incident and has launched an investigation.</p>

          <p>The semi-final stage of Women's Euro 2025 is set, featuring England, Spain, Germany, and Italy. Defending champions England advanced after a dramatic penalty shootout against Sweden, showcasing resilience despite not being at their best. Spain, the reigning World Cup champions, have been a dominant force, scoring 16 goals in the tournament so far. Eight-time champions Germany overcame a chaotic quarter-final, while Italy, the lowest-ranked team remaining, secured their spot with a stoppage-time winner against Norway. Each team brings unique strengths and key players into the high-stakes final four matchups.</p>

          <p>A new mural honoring the late Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, immortalizing the iconic pitcher who passed away nine months ago. Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his famous wind-up pose and tipping his cap, symbolizing his connection to the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked "Fernandomania" and became a cultural hero, especially for Latino fans. The mural serves as a vibrant tribute to the man whose legacy transcended the sport and inspired a generation.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his first Open Championship with a commanding four-shot victory, prompting his peers to draw comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods. This marks Scheffler's fourth major title in three years, a run that fellow golfers like Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy described as historically impressive. Scheffler's consistent, unflappable performance at Royal Portrush rarely seemed in doubt as he converted a 54-hole lead for the tenth consecutive time. His victory solidifies his status as the world's undisputed top golfer and raises questions about how many major championships he could ultimately win.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant four-shot victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler humbly downplayed his achievement and rejected comparisons to golf legend Tiger Woods. The 29-year-old insisted he is not "anything special" and reiterated his belief that family and faith are more fulfilling than professional success, even a major championship win. Scheffler, who has now won four majors, stated that while he is grateful for his success, it does not define him or satisfy his deepest desires. He emphasized that the joy of winning is temporary, whereas the lessons and relationships built through golf are more lasting.</p>
