          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has reported favorable initial outcomes from the country's tightened border controls, disputing concerns about overburdened personnel. Since the reintroduction of temporary checks at all nine land borders in September 2024, nearly 1,200 additional officers have been deployed, bringing the total to approximately 13,000-14,000 federal police officers at the borders. Romann has rejected claims that personnel would be redirected from other operational areas, such as train stations, for border control duties. The move is aimed at bolstering security and managing migration flows. The increase in border control may lead to more stability.</p>

          <p>Theoharis and Sandweiss-Back argue that amidst proposed legislative cuts impacting the poor, there's a need to fight for a new social contract. They draw lessons from historical poor people's movements, like the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), which demonstrated the power of organized, militant action and community care. The authors propose four strategic principles based on the "Johnnie Tillmon model" to empower the poor and drive social change. The piece suggests that by uniting across differences and addressing daily needs, marginalized communities can build lasting power. The article suggests that people may be able to overcome adversity and achieve a better future.</p>

          <p>Many U.S. universities have been torn with strife for the last decade. However, the Trump administration's campaign to defund research, hike endowment taxes, dictate admissions and faculty appointments and otherwise forcibly reshape universities has united faculties, student bodies, donor populations and alumni groups. To successfully repel this onslaught, university communities will have to sustain and build upon this improbable, newfound and fragile unity. Doing so will mean accepting the idea that, to make common cause, one need not hold every cause in common. The unification of the universities is a positive development.</p>
