          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. Archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes analyzed early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The study indicates that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This contrasts with a 2017 study suggesting pigs were introduced to northern Europe from the Middle East around 4500 BC. </p>

          <p>Patrick Reed made an albatross, a rare shot in golf, during the first round of the US Open, holing out with a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole. Despite the albatross, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, including a triple bogey on the 18th hole. This marks only the fourth albatross recorded at the US Open since 1983. Reed's score reflects the challenging nature of the course despite his exceptional shot. </p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats. Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, and major issues include rising living costs, political funding scandals, and child-rearing. The election features around 300 candidates, marking the highest number in over 30 years. </p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion to ensure survival in the face of US tariffs. Production abroad is seen as key to their long-term viability, with firms diversifying their production bases. Tariffs on solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain high, prompting Chinese firms to shift expansion plans towards the Middle East, Africa, the US, and Europe. The industry expects that simply exporting isn‚Äôt enough; you must also localize production abroad. </p>
