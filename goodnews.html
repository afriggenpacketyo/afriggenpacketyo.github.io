          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.5 billion years old, making it more ancient than our own planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite known as a chondrite, created a loud boom and was seen as a fireball across the state in late June. Researchers are studying fragments to better understand its composition and trajectory, which could provide valuable data for planetary defense against future asteroid threats. The incident marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, with experts noting that modern technology and public awareness are increasing the frequency of such finds.</p>

          <p>Actress Lindsay Lohan revealed that the intense and terrifying experiences with paparazzi during her youth led to her developing post-traumatic stress disorder and ultimately drove her to leave Hollywood. Now residing in Dubai with her husband and son, Lohan says the move has provided her with a safe and normal life, free from the constant media intrusion she faced in Los Angeles. She notes that in Dubai, strict privacy laws prevent the kind of aggressive photography that was common in her early career. Lohan feels that social media has now given celebrities more control over their own narratives, a tool she lacked in the early 2000s.</p>

          <p>Miami's iconic Freedom Tower, which served as a processing center for over half a million Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s, is reopening to the public after a major refurbishment. A new exhibition, "Libertad," captures the emotional journeys of those who fled Fidel Castro's regime, featuring personal artifacts and over 350 recorded stories. For many, like Jorge Malagón Márquez who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old, the tower represents a pivotal moment of fear and hope. The restored landmark, now owned by Miami-Dade College, aims to preserve this critical chapter of Miami's history and its role as a symbol of refuge and new beginnings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, "SLIP: Life in the Middle of Eating Disorder Recovery," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her journey with anorexia, which began after her mother's death when she was 11. The book combines memoir with research to explore the concept of living in a "middle place" between acute illness and full recovery. Tarpley argues against the perfectionistic, all-or-nothing approach to recovery, suggesting that embracing imperfections and accepting setbacks can lead to a more sustainable and fulfilling life. This perspective is particularly relevant as diet culture re-emerges, making the path to recovery even more complex for many.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's directive for NASA to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade is a critical step toward establishing a permanent human settlement. A lunar base would require substantial energy to sustain life, and solar power is insufficient for the 14-day lunar nights. While some fear geopolitical conflict with China, which is planning its own larger nuclear-powered base, the effort could spur innovation and international cooperation, similar to past space races. A permanent, powered base could become a global commons for research, including housing powerful telescopes on the far side to search for extraterrestrial signals.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California is planning major investments to ensure future water security. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes a massive $8 billion wastewater recycling project, enhanced stormwater capture, and potential desalination plants. The goal is to create a more resilient, localized water system to avoid a "Day Zero" scenario, where taps could run dry, as was narrowly averted in Cape Town, South Africa. These costly projects aim to build a sustainable water future while attempting to keep water affordable for the region's 19 million residents.</p>

          <h2>As Climate Change Worsens Flooding, Cities Explore 'Sponge City' Concepts</h2>

          <p>Cities like Bangkok and Los Angeles are grappling with the dual threats of intense rainfall and drought, revealing the limits of traditional concrete-based flood control systems. In response, architects and planners are advocating for the "sponge city" model, which uses green infrastructure like parks and wetlands to absorb, clean, and store stormwater naturally. This approach not only mitigates flooding but also replenishes groundwater, creates recreational spaces, and improves water quality. While China has invested heavily in thousands of such projects, implementation in places like L.A. has been slower due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs, despite voter-approved funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With billions of single-use cups and containers ending up in landfills, the reuse movement is gaining traction as a viable solution to the waste crisis. A recent pilot program in Petaluma, California, tested a city-wide system where customers at 30 stores could use a reusable cup for free and return it to collection bins for washing and redistribution. The program, backed by major corporations like Starbucks and Coca-Cola, saw a return rate of over 50%, surpassing the environmental break-even point compared to single-use cups. Organizers say the success was driven by community pride, demonstrating the potential for large-scale reusable systems to reduce waste.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is undergoing a significant transformation as it becomes the epicenter of an artificial intelligence boom, drawing billions in venture capital and revitalizing the city's economy. The frenzy has filled office spaces left vacant during the pandemic and created a vibrant ecosystem of AI startups, events, and hacker houses, infusing the city with a new sense of optimism. However, this new gold rush also brings anxiety, with concerns about the high cost of living, ongoing tech layoffs, and the potential for AI to displace human workers. The city is now a living laboratory for AI's societal impact, from art exhibits to protests over its ethical implications.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures forecast to climb above 30C in the coming days. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England from Monday to Wednesday, as temperatures are expected to peak at 34C (93F) in the south Midlands on Tuesday. The warm spell is caused by high pressure drawing up warm air from the south. While England and Wales will experience the most sunshine, the heat and humidity may also trigger some scattered thunderstorms across parts of the UK.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a surge in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new and expanded ferry routes. Turkish tourists are drawn by the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish coastal resorts. This influx is providing a significant boost to the local economy and fostering positive interactions between Greeks and Turks, despite ongoing political tensions between their governments over maritime borders and other issues. Local officials and business owners welcome the trend, seeing it as a way to strengthen cross-border relations and heal historical wounds through personal connection.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in Beijing has developed a new set of genome editing tools that can precisely manipulate large DNA fragments, a breakthrough that could significantly advance genetic research. The new technology, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) systems, makes it much easier and more efficient to edit large-scale DNA sequences. This innovation is expected to open new possibilities for improving crop traits and treating genetic diseases. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the advance could also accelerate the creation of artificial chromosomes, a key component in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics company Unitree, predicts that the robotics industry could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While current hardware is capable, Wang believes the crucial missing piece is more advanced artificial intelligence for "embodied intelligence." He expressed skepticism about current models but noted that new approaches, like generating interactive video models for robots to follow, show significant promise.</p>
