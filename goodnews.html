          <p>Scientists in China are focusing on developing artificial intelligence applications to address tangible societal problems, including disability support and discrimination. At Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, a team led by Su Jionglong has created AI-powered software that translates written text into sign language, which can be deployed on mobile apps or smart glasses. The goal is to innovate technologies that meet genuine social needs, such as improving classroom learning for deaf students and facilitating better communication in medical settings. The project has attracted interest from local governments for financial support to help launch the products.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Questions if Conservative Judges Will Uphold Free Speech Protections for Flag Burning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column explores the constitutional debate over flag burning, contrasting President Trump's call to prosecute offenders with the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's principled defense of the act as protected speech. Despite his personal disdain for flag burning, Scalia, a constitutional originalist, famously sided with the majority in a 1989 ruling that affirmed it as a form of political protest under the First Amendment. The author questions whether the many conservative judges influenced by Scalia and the Federalist Society will adhere to this precedent or bend to political pressure from the current administration. The piece frames it as a test of their commitment to constitutional principles over personal or political feelings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising shoplifting rates, the city of Long Beach, California, has enacted a first-of-its-kind ordinance requiring large retail and pharmacy stores to increase staffing around self-checkout areas. The law mandates at least one employee for every three self-checkout stations and limits customers to 15 items. The measure has sparked a heated debate, with some stores closing their self-checkout lanes entirely, leading to longer lines for shoppers. While the grocery workers' union supports the law for enhancing safety, retail associations warn it will increase labor costs, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>As the Scottish National Party (SNP) prepares for its annual conference, First Minister John Swinney is focused on stabilizing the party and shifting its focus toward deliverable public service improvements. After a period of turmoil following the successive resignations of his predecessors, Swinney has calmed internal controversies and aims to demonstrate governing competence. While the path to Scottish independence remains a central, though challenging, goal for the party, recent polls suggest the SNP has a notable lead over a slumping Labour party. Swinney's strategy appears to be balancing the long-term independence cause with immediate governance priorities to secure a fifth term.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children, who were displaced by the war and separated from their families, have been successfully reunited with their loved ones. She stated this development followed an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who responded to a "peace letter" she sent regarding the conflict's child victims. The reunification was facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine, and the identities and circumstances of each child were confirmed by the U.S. government. This marks a positive outcome for her BE BEST initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children globally.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland faces a significant setback as key player Conor Bradley will miss the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Germany due to suspension. The Liverpool defender, who was lauded as the best player on the pitch in the recent 2-0 victory over Slovakia, received a yellow card that triggers a one-game ban. Bradley's energetic and talismanic performance was crucial to the win, which kept Northern Ireland's qualification hopes alive.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 03:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA is currently redrafting its regulations concerning domestic league matches being held abroad and is seeking legal advice on whether a complete ban is feasible. The move comes as leagues like Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A have received approval from UEFA to stage games in the United States and Australia. The current rules, written in 2014, require approval from multiple confederations and associations but do not give FIFA direct power to block such matches. The governing body aims to create more robust rules to prevent a global free-for-all, despite potential legal challenges from promoters.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has issued new guidelines for its local governments on the implementation of artificial intelligence, with a strong warning against giving AI models access to sensitive data or state secrets. The document outlines acceptable uses for AI, such as answering public queries, infrastructure monitoring, and drafting documents, to improve efficiency and reduce bureaucratic burdens. However, it mandates that complete safety evaluations must be conducted before any AI model goes online. The guidelines also stress the importance of training government workers in AI safety and ethics to ensure responsible deployment of the technology.</p>
