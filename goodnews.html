          <h2>Chinese Research Suggests Impotence Drugs May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 06:00:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A recent study from China indicates that sildenafil, the active ingredient in drugs like Viagra, could possess significant anti-cancer capabilities. Researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions found that the drug may bolster the immune system by strengthening key anti-tumor cells known as dendritic cells. These cells, which often become impaired as tumors progress, could have their function restored by sildenafil. The findings, published in the journal Nature, are being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest US-proposed plan for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, signaling readiness for immediate negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested several changes, including a halt to a US-backed aid system and a guarantee that the war will not resume. The proposal reportedly includes a 60-day truce, the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased aid to Gaza. The development comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to visit the White House.</p>

          <h2>Workplace Crying Sparks Discussion on Professionalism and Emotional Expression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:31:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The act of crying at work is increasingly being viewed as a sign of being human rather than a professional weakness. Following a UK politician's tearful appearance in Parliament, a broader discussion has emerged about emotional expression in professional settings. While some still hold traditional views that see crying as a sign of instability, many experts and employees argue it reflects emotional intelligence and dedication. Career coaches suggest that compassionate employers who support staff through emotional moments are more likely to foster a motivated and happier workforce in the long run.</p>

          <p>FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans into some of its credit scoring models this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of these installment-based payment services, especially among younger and lower-income consumers. Lenders have sought this data for a more complete financial picture of applicants, potentially preventing them from offering more credit than a person can afford. For consumers, making timely BNPL payments could help build credit, while missed payments could negatively impact their FICO score.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing role as a foundational layer for mainstream finance. Major financial players are increasingly building on Ethereum, with Robinhood launching tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network and Deutsche Bank developing a tokenization platform. This institutional adoption is shifting the focus from speculative trading to utility, with firms valuing Ethereum's stability, security, and dependability for transactions. While still trailing Bitcoin, this trend suggests a significant maturation of the Ethereum ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved a new milestone in renewable energy by launching a large-scale offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. Developed by state-owned Sinopec, this project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the company's largest initiative of its kind. The station spans 60,000 square meters and is expected to generate a combined 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This innovative approach, which uses the ocean surface, is reported to be more efficient than land-based panels due to the cooling effect of the water.</p>

          <p>The long-debated question of whether culture influences how people see the world is explored through two recent studies with conflicting findings on visual illusions. One study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments perceive illusions differently than those from rural Namibian communities, supporting an old hypothesis. However, another study convincingly debunks this explanation for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects animals and even the formerly blind. The author suggests that perception is an active brain construction, leading to diversity not just between but also within cultures, urging humility about our own way of seeing.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, public swimming is officially permitted in the Seine River in Paris. As part of the legacy of the 2024 Olympics, authorities have opened three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities. The reopening follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve the river's water quality, which had been contaminated by pollution for decades. This initiative was a key promise for the Olympics, where the river hosted swimming events, and is now being celebrated as a major quality-of-life improvement for residents and tourists.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a potential breakthrough in regenerative medicine by discovering a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal Science, found that the inability of mice to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in development. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the researchers achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. The team believes this mechanism might also be present in other organs, offering hope for future human applications, though the path remains long.</p>
