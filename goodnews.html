          <p>A 20-year-old man in Ocala, Florida, narrowly avoided a fatal injury when a stray bullet from an accidental shooting was reportedly deflected by a gold cross pendant he was wearing. The bullet, which struck him in the chest, was split by the necklace, preventing it from damaging his major organs, according to his trauma surgeon. The man, Aidan Perry, survived with a broken humerus and credits his faith for the remarkable outcome, stating the experience has strengthened his belief in God. The individual who allegedly fired the weapon unintentionally has been arrested and charged with culpable negligence.</p>

          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, "Weapons," is receiving acclaim for its compelling story about a group of third-graders who mysteriously vanish from their homes one night. The movie follows the community's attempt to understand the tragedy, eventually revealing a supernatural villain whose defeat provides a sense of catharsis. However, the film also explores the limits of such relief, showing that vanquishing the source of evil does not erase the trauma it has already caused. Critics praise the movie for its daring narrative choices, strong performances, and its ability to deliver genre thrills while thoughtfully examining themes of grief and loss.</p>

          <p>The health care sector emerged as the top performer in the stock market this week, buoyed by strong performances from companies like Eli Lilly and a newly revealed Berkshire Hathaway stake in UnitedHealth Group. In contrast, technology, consumer staples, and utilities sectors all posted negative returns as the market saw a rotation from momentum-based stocks into value-oriented laggards. Looking ahead, the market focus will shift to retail earnings reports and Federal Reserve commentary from the upcoming Jackson Hole symposium, which could provide clues on future interest rate policy.

          <p>President Trump's recent justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force, which cited an "out of control" crime crisis, has been found to be misleading. While D.C.'s homicide rate was high in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and the comparison to states is itself misleading as D.C. is a city. Furthermore, the president's statements failed to acknowledge that violent crime and homicides in the district have seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025, a trend consistent with a nationwide reduction in crime, according to FBI data and independent analyses.</p>

          <h2>New Method Using 'Acid Bubbles' Shows Promise for Efficiently Converting CO2 into Valuable Materials</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 13:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Rice University have developed a more efficient method for converting carbon dioxide into useful materials like fuels and industrial chemicals through electrochemical reduction. The breakthrough involves using acid-humidified CO2, which prevents the formation of salts that typically clog the system and halt the process. In lab tests, this new approach allowed the system to operate stably for over 2,000 hours, a dramatic improvement over the 80-hour lifespan of traditional water-humidified methods. This discovery could represent a significant step toward turning a major pollutant into a valuable resource, aiding efforts to combat climate change.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly 60% of American adults now consider paying down credit card debt a top financial priority, as total balances exceed $1.21 trillion and average interest rates approach 22%. Despite this focus, about 45% of adults carry balances on more than one card, complicating repayment efforts. To tackle this, financial experts recommend strategies such as debt consolidation through loans or balance transfer cards, which can simplify payments and lower interest rates. Other options include seeking help from credit counseling agencies for debt management plans or exploring hardship programs offered by card issuers for temporary relief.</p>

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area, which is home to one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, which involve withdrawing steam and injecting cold water deep underground. Officials have stated that this activity is distinct from the region's major seismic hazards, which are located on different fault lines.</p>

          <p>Consumer spending on jewelry in the United States continues to show robust growth, contrasting with weaker sales trends in Europe and China, according to jewelry brand Pandora. The U.S. market, which saw an 8% sales increase for the company, is a key outlier in the global luxury market. However, the industry faces headwinds from President Trump's tariffs, particularly for companies manufacturing in countries like Thailand. While brands are currently absorbing some of the costs, the combination of tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising silver prices could eventually impact strong U.S. consumer demand.
