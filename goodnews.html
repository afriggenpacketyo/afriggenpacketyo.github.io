          <p>AMD reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, with a revenue of $7.44 billion driven by strong demand in its data center segment, which saw a 57% increase due to Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. CEO Lisa Su acknowledged challenges from regulatory restrictions on advanced AI chip exports, particularly impacting shipments to China, but believes these are offset by strong product performance. AMD's chips are being used to train AI models, with a major developer deploying AMD chips for inference. The company's client and gaming segment also rose 28% due to laptop and PC chip sales, while gaming sales declined due to decreased console chip revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ed Martin's nomination to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia is at risk after Republican Senator Thom Tillis announced his opposition, citing Martin's association with "Stop the Steal" and backing of Jan. 6 rioters. With Martin's interim term expiring May 20, his nomination may not make it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin, who previously defended some Jan. 6 defendants, has expressed views aligning with President Trump's perspective of the Capitol attack as a "day of love," and has fired some of the prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases. Senator Durbin believes that Martin's nomination is unlikely to succeed.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade deal after three years of discussions, aimed at easing exports for UK firms to India and reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear. The British government hails the agreement as "landmark," projecting a ¬£25.5bn annual boost to trade by 2040, but emphasizes it does not alter immigration policies. The deal encompasses tariff reductions on goods, including gin, whisky, cars, and food, while also addressing services and procurement sectors. Some workers will benefit from a three-year exemption from social security payments, fostering economic growth and job creation in both nations.</p>

          <p>Tariffs enacted by President Trump are likely to raise prices on flowers ahead of Mother's Day, impacting both consumers and florists. While a 90-day pause on hefty tariffs was announced, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. The U.S. imports approximately 80% of its flowers, primarily from Colombia and Ecuador, with small domestic growers also affected due to imported bulbs. Some florists plan to absorb the costs, while others may need to increase prices, and consumers may need to be flexible about their flower choices.</p>

Von Furstenberg emphasized that Diller's announcement was not a "coming out" but simply telling the truth, noting that he opened to her 50 years ago.</p>

          <p>Restaurants across the country are featuring salads made with whole leaves, prioritizing visual appeal, textural integrity, and dressing adhesion, though this can make them less elegant to eat. Chefs note that whole leaves cradle toppings more effectively and maintain freshness better than pre-cut greens. Some diners appreciate the aesthetic, while others find them impractical and prefer chopped salads. The trend is a revival of sorts, with roots in the classic wedge and Caesar salads, and reflects a desire to elevate the salad experience beyond the ordinary.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece discusses how television portrays the rich through aspiration, judgment, and reassurance. The author analyzes "Your Friends & Neighbors," a new Apple TV show, as an example of a portrayal that eliminates aspirational identification by depicting wealthy characters as unhappy and insecure. The author contrasts this with shows like "Mad Men," where even characters with personal problems inhabit a more stylish and enviable world, and suggests that the key to the full picture of how wealth is experienced in America requires a balance of both.</p>
