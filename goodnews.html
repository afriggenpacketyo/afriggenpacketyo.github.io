This performance makes him the 21st player in MLB history and the fourth Phillie to accomplish this, with Mike Schmidt being the last in 1976. Schwarber's historic night included a team-record nine RBIs, propelling him to the top of the National League home run leaderboard with 49 for the season. His exceptional game was a key factor in the Phillies' dominant 19-4 victory.</p>

This high-level meeting occurs amidst ongoing tensions, including border disputes and economic competition, but also as both nations face tariff pressures from the United States. While deep-seated suspicion remains, particularly regarding trade imbalances and China's military support for Pakistan, the visit suggests a potential for reluctant cooperation. Experts believe that shared economic challenges could be pushing the two Asian powers toward finding common ground, despite their adversarial history.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the DNA of an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, known as the Druids Oak, to uncover the genetic secrets of its remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to understand how ancient oaks survive threats like climate change and disease. By analyzing the genomes of about 50 ancient oaks across the UK, scientists hope to identify key genetic traits. This knowledge could be vital for selecting the most robust trees for future planting, helping to restore Britain's woodlands and support the diverse ecosystems they host.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, and a catch-up program is planned for older children. Previously, parents had to pay for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>
