          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over half of its revenue originating from outside the U.S. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field emphasized the benefits of public ownership and signaled intentions for future acquisitions.

          <p>Shares for clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, experienced a notable increase after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

While the removal was a relief for investors, industry groups like SEIA and ACP cautioned that the overall bill still phases out crucial tax credits and undermines long-term growth for renewable energy.

The company aims for cost parity with traditional manufacturing and plans for its material to be a "drop-in" component for existing diaper brands.

While a Santander spokesperson stated it is "business as usual for now," they did not rule out future branch closures or job cuts due to role duplication.

The nonprofit is led by Anne Wojcicki, who co-founded 23andMe and served as its CEO, providing a potential lifeline for the distressed company. The sale proceeded despite privacy concerns from several states over the handling of genetic data from 13 million customers. The judge ruled that the sale to Wojcicki's new entity would likely improve privacy practices while honoring customer rights, as the company's data will not be disclosed to new third parties.</p>

          <p>The new film "40 Acres" is a post-apocalyptic thriller starring Danielle Deadwyler as a military veteran protecting her family from cannibals on their isolated Canadian farmstead. The review praises Deadwyler's performance as the family's matriarch, who is rooted in generational trauma and a fierce, self-reliant determination to survive. While the film's debut director, R.T. Thorne, is noted for a sometimes heavy-handed approach and blurry symbolism, the movie is described as a resolute and tense portrait of survival. The story's heart is found in the relationship between the mother and her eldest son, who yearns for a connection to the outside world.</p>
