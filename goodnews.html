          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the Trump administration has made significant progress in trade negotiations with China, following meetings in Switzerland. President Trump confirmed the progress, stating that a "total reset" was negotiated in a constructive manner, with the goal of opening China to American businesses. The talks aim to address the trade deficit and high tariffs imposed by both countries, which have disrupted global supply chains. This development follows a recently signed trade deal with the UK, indicating the administration's broader efforts to establish fair and reciprocal trade agreements. The article also notes that the UK deal keeps an existing 10% tariff in place against U.K. goods, while removing some import taxes on items like steel and cars.</p>

          <p>TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller's new memoir, "Who Knew," explores his career, including his time at ABC where he helped popularize the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week." In the book, Diller emphasizes the importance of instinct over relying solely on data and research when making decisions. He argues that too much information can overload and obscure the essence of a good idea, and that simple human instinct is crucial for success. Diller shares anecdotes about greenlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on his gut feeling.</p>
