          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books for AI training. The settlement will compensate rights holders approximately $3,000 per book, though it does not cover future works. While the court previously ruled AI training as transformative fair use, Anthropic was found to have wrongfully acquired materials from pirate websites. This landmark agreement is seen as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for intellectual property infringement and ensuring fair compensation.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby woken by a loud commercial, aims to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services. The article seeks to extend federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act protections, which currently apply only to traditional broadcasters, to platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, this legislation could set a national precedent due to California's market influence. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing challenges for smaller streaming services in controlling ad volumes from various sources.</p>

This new center aims to create 1,300 additional donation slots annually, addressing a critical global shortage of cell collection facilities for patients with blood cancers and disorders. The charity highlights that current capacity issues often delay transplants, which can have severe health consequences. Donors like Jordan, who registered nine years ago, express pride in helping save lives through this simple, yet vital, process, offering hope to many patients.</p>

Combs, preparing for the Grand Ole Opry's historic first performance outside the US at London's Royal Albert Hall, notes a distinct difference in British fans who consume entire albums rather than just singles. He credits streaming for expanding country music's reach and appreciates the UK audience's focused listening. The success of artists like Post Malone and Jelly Roll in broadening the fanbase is also cited as a factor in this global growth.</p>

          <p>CBS News California Investigates interviewed 11 candidates running for California governor in 2026, asking them to evaluate Governor Gavin Newsom's and the Legislature's performance. Democrats praised Newsom's stances on issues like redistricting and universal school meals, while suggesting improvements in housing and high-speed rail. Republican candidates largely criticized Newsom, accusing him of acting like a Republican for presidential ambitions and failing on state issues. The interviews highlight diverse perspectives on California's economy, housing crisis, and the state's focus on national versus local concerns, reflecting a dynamic political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Tropical Storm Humberto May Interact with Another System in Rare Fujiwhara Effect</h2>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm of the hurricane season, is currently over the central tropical Atlantic and could potentially interact with another developing system nearby. This interaction, though unlikely, might lead to a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms merge or orbit a common center. Forecasters anticipate Humberto to strengthen into a hurricane, while the second system is expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda. While a collision could alter their paths slightly, the stronger Humberto would likely absorb the weaker system if they merge, demonstrating complex atmospheric dynamics.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The coral, protected under the Endangered Species Act and CITES, was in poor health after five days in transit and would have perished without intervention. Aquarium staff describe the facility as a 'coral hospital,' where the rescued specimens are rehabilitated and now serve as ambassadors for their species on public display. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges of illegal wildlife trade and the importance of conservation efforts for marine ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer's acquisition of Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, focused on next-generation weight-loss drugs, is anticipated to stimulate increased research and development spending in China's pharmaceutical sector. Analysts suggest this deal, along with others by global pharma giants, reinforces a 'portfolio approach' in obesity drug development, creating opportunities for emerging innovators. Metsera possesses several pre-human testing candidates aiming for improved efficacy and tolerability with fewer injections. This strategic move by Pfizer signals continued strong investment in the rapidly evolving metabolic disease market, potentially leading to new treatments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An aggressive squirrel in a Lucas Valley, California neighborhood has caused alarm by attacking several residents, with at least two requiring emergency room treatment for bites and scratches. The attacks prompted a local humane society to confirm the incidents and a realtor to post warnings. Experts suggest such unusual aggression is often linked to humans hand-feeding or hand-raising wildlife, causing animals to lose their natural fear. While squirrels rarely carry rabies, the incident serves as a reminder against interacting closely with wild animals for safety and public health.</p>

Yang, who helped draft previous plans, emphasized the need to increase the share of household disposable income in national income and consumer spending's share of total demand.
