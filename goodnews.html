          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE in March. A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing concerns about due process and First Amendment rights after she co-authored an op-ed criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk thanked her community and supporters, while Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed her home, emphasizing the importance of protecting free speech and due process. Ozturk's lawyers argued her detention violated her rights, and her asthma worsened during her time in the detention center.</p>
