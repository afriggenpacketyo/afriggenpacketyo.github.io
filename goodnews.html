        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, driven by strong global demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence. The company's performance significantly surpassed market expectations, with revenue climbing over 35% and operating profit jumping nearly 69% year-over-year. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, expects this momentum to continue, projecting that its HBM sales for the full year will double compared to 2024. This success has positioned the company to challenge Samsung for the top spot in the global memory market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from established legal principles. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, though the White House has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>

          <h2>Giants' Rafael Devers Expresses Preference for Playing Defense Over Designated Hitter Role</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 21:59:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This contrasts sharply with his previous stance while with the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field keeps him more active and mentally engaged in the game, rather than constantly focusing on his next at-bat. His successful debut included two base hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. This surge was partly attributed to firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts remain cautious, suggesting that the export-led growth may not be sustainable if global trade softens under the threat of new tariffs.

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, establishing a 19% tariff on imports from the two nations while ensuring American exports face no duties. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to counter China's influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the agreements are seen as part of a broader U.S. effort to contain China's economic power. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asian countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, which passed with bipartisan support, seeks to increase transparency following a recent DOJ review that asserted Epstein had no incriminating "client list." The move signals growing pressure from Congress for more information, even as some Republican leaders have resisted action on the issue. The subpoenas will also seek communications related to the case from former presidents, attorneys general, and FBI directors, though the Justice Department has historically resisted such congressional requests.</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in extra time against Germany, sending her team to the Euro 2025 final against England. Her heroic moment comes after a difficult start to the tournament, as she was discharged from a hospital just days before the competition began after suffering from viral meningitis. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner was eased back into play but demonstrated her world-class skill when it mattered most. Her journey from a hospital bed to scoring the crucial goal that secured Spain's first-ever Women's Euro final appearance has been a source of inspiration.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, a mission designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The identical spacecraft will fly in tandem to provide detailed measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. This process creates space weather, which can generate spectacular auroras but also disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and satellites. By better understanding these dynamics, scientists hope to eventually predict and mitigate the potentially dangerous effects of solar activity on critical Earth-based and space-based infrastructure.</p>

The team boasts a talented roster with veterans like quarterback Matthew Stafford and young stars such as Puka Nacua and Jared Verse. However, major concerns include the health of the 37-year-old Stafford, who is starting camp with back soreness, and the stability of the offensive line following a blood clot issue for left tackle Alaric Jackson. The team is also counting on its existing cornerbacks to step up and is navigating contract negotiations with star running back Kyren Williams.</p>
