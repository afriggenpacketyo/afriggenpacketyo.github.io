          <p>Amazon has announced it will shut down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August, consolidating its content into the Prime Video platform. Originally launched in 2019, the Freevee app will be discontinued, but its shows and movies will remain available to watch for free on Prime Video, even without a Prime membership. This decision follows Amazon's introduction of an ad-supported tier to its main Prime Video service earlier this year. The company stated the move is intended to create a simpler and more unified viewing experience for all of its customers.</p>

The event aimed to unify the party and energize voters ahead of the key election, focusing on themes of job growth and business-friendly policies. The rally drew a large crowd and signaled the official start of the GOP's campaign to maintain control of the state's executive branch.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill into law that more than doubles the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing its annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is designed to make California more competitive and lure back productions that have moved to other states and countries offering more lucrative incentives. Industry leaders and unions have praised the decision, stating it will help stimulate production that has slowed due to strikes, studio spending cuts, and other recent challenges. A separate bill to further expand the types of eligible productions and credit percentages is also under consideration by the legislature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to severely limit access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" to justify the crackdown, unlawfully supplants the immigration laws established by Congress. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor existing statutes grant the executive branch the sweeping authority to create an alternative immigration system. The ruling is a significant blow to one of President Trump's key second-term immigration policies, though its effective date is paused for 14 days to allow for an appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before the previously established February 2026 deadline. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which currently protects migrants who have built lives in the U.S. based on the program.</p>

          <p>Amid a severe heat wave, the European Commission has proposed a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. This goal is intended to keep the bloc on track for its 2050 net-zero target and provide certainty for investors. However, the proposal includes a controversial flexibility clause allowing member states to purchase international carbon credits to offset up to 3% of their emissions from 2036. Environmental activists have criticized this clause, arguing it undermines domestic climate action, while some member states feel the overall target is too ambitious.</p>

          <p>Researchers are launching a new expedition to a remote Pacific island in hopes of solving the 88-year-old mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance. The mission, organized by Purdue University, was prompted by a 2015 satellite image that may show part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra 10E aircraft on Nikumaroro, an island in Kiribati. Researchers believe the object's size and location align with Earhart's intended route and the origin of her emergency radio calls. The team will travel to the island in November to search for the object and attempt to confirm if it is the remains of the long-lost plane.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will set a 20% tariff on goods imported into the U.S. from the country. This deal avoids a much higher 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect as part of a global tariff plan. In exchange, Vietnam has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. products, opening its markets to American goods. The agreement also includes a steep 40% tariff on items that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at preventing exporters from bypassing higher duties.
