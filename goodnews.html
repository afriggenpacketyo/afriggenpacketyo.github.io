          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the Yangtze. The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species in the river's upper reaches. For decades, the dense network of dams has fragmented the river, blocking fish migration routes and drastically reducing water flow, sometimes causing sections to dry up entirely. This project seeks to reverse the ecological damage and save the last refuge for many unique aquatic species.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player on social media. The player is widely reported to be Montrezl Harrell, an American who formerly played in the NBA and now plays for the Adelaide 36ers. The man was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass, or offend. Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a landmark moment, emphasizing its zero-tolerance policy towards such abuse and its commitment to creating a safe and respectful environment for all athletes.</p>

          <p>As part of its goal to enhance resource security, China has identified 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. The Ministry of Natural Resources reported significant new reserves, including an estimated 3.37 million tonnes of rubidium and 81 tonnes of gold. Investment in mineral exploration surged, particularly for critical elements like tin, bauxite, and copper, which are vital for the aerospace, semiconductor, and green energy industries. This push aims to strengthen China's national energy and mineral resource security amid a global race for these materials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling indicating she will order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals as part of its mass deportation plan. The ruling addresses a lawsuit filed by immigrant rights groups, which argued that federal agents were unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong pressed the government's lawyer on the lack of specific evidence justifying the arrests. A final order is expected soon in the case, which has become a key battle over the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in a new seven-mile-long wastewater tunnel being built as part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's Clearwater Project. After an hour-long rescue operation involving a massive response from LAFD's Urban Search and Rescue teams, all workers were brought to safety with no visible injuries. The project has been put on hold, and Cal/OSHA is investigating the cause of the collapse to ensure site safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the order from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This ruling comes after a recent Supreme Court decision that limited the use of nationwide injunctions but still allowed them through specific legal avenues like class-action suits. The White House criticized the decision, vowing to fight what it called an unlawful attempt to impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Bianchi, now 74, and his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. were responsible for the murders of 12 women in the 1970s, where they impersonated police officers to lure victims before sexually assaulting and killing them. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the board ruled that Bianchi will not be eligible for another parole hearing for 10 years. Buono, his accomplice in the crimes, died in prison back in 2002.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite weighing over 54 pounds that is expected to sell for up to $4 million. The rock, named NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet and was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe it was dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles to Earth. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making this a significant opportunity for collectors and a valuable dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made a remarkable and unlikely fossil discovery on its own property. While drilling a deep borehole to study geothermal heating potential, a sample from over 750 feet below the museum's parking lot revealed a dinosaur vertebra. Curators described the find as incredibly rare, likening it to a hole-in-one from the moon. The bone is believed to be from a small, plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago. The unique fossil is now on display for visitors at the museum.</p>

While the meeting's agenda was not disclosed, Nvidia has been navigating U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, which have effectively cut off sales to the significant Chinese market. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, attributing its 47% rise to his tariff policies. The administration is also considering newer, simpler restrictions on which countries can receive Nvidia's powerful AI technology.</p>

Hundreds of locals and tourists gathered to watch the restored landmark, with the occasion marked by a street performance of the can-can by 60 dancers and fireworks from the cabaret's roof. The original collapse was blamed on a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed last summer, delays with a new electric motor kept them motionless until now, restoring a key symbol of Parisian nightlife.</p>

          <p>A political strategist claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. In his new book, Chris Bruni-Lowe identifies eight words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. He describes these words not as a guarantee of victory, but as "emotional shortcuts" or building blocks that work across different cultures and political ideologies. The analysis suggests these powerful words can be bent to fit various narratives, from conservative to socialist campaigns, to connect with voters on an instinctive level.</p>

The application covers operations both with and without human safety drivers, with a decision expected by the end of July. This expansion follows Tesla's recent pilot launch in Austin, Texas, where supervised Model Y vehicles have been offering rides to invited passengers. While once a pioneer, Tesla is now playing catch-up to Alphabet's Waymo, which has been running a public driverless service in the Phoenix area since 2020.</p>
