          <p>Emerging market stocks are gaining traction as confidence in U.S. assets diminishes, fueled by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America and JPMorgan have expressed optimism towards emerging markets, citing factors like a weaker U.S. dollar, China's economic recovery, and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a shift in investor sentiment. Despite some rebound in U.S. equities, the Moody's downgrade has reignited concerns among traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are urging the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and Easyjet, for their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation accuses the airlines of misleading passengers and causing distress at check-ins with unfair hand baggage practices. Passengers can face extra charges up to ‚Ç¨280 for luggage. The groups are seeking an investigation and sanctions, advocating for a standard luggage allowance within the ticket purchase.

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues tied to ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests the yen's weakness against the dollar will not be a focal point in tariff discussions. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy and financial markets. Japan has been considering backing off from seeking a full removal of U.S. tariffs, aiming to strike a quick deal.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. has filed a $100-million suit against several Southern California law firms, alleging a fraudulent scheme involving the state's Lemon Law.

The complaint describes invoices as a ‚Äúmagical mystery tour of fictitious billings‚Äù and claims a partner billed over 20 hours per day on multiple occasions.</p>
