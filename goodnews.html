          <p>Approximately 17,000 people were evacuated from the Old Town district of Dresden, Germany, after a 250-kilogram British bomb from World War II was discovered. The unexploded ordnance was found during clearance work for a bridge that collapsed in 2024, affecting an area that includes the famous Frauenkirche. Such discoveries remain common in Germany, highlighting the lingering dangers of the war nearly 80 years later, as the bomb is now being defused by experts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, leveraging home equity is a key financial strategy, with options including selling the home or obtaining a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to access their equity as cash without a monthly payment, helping cover living expenses, but it reduces the inheritance for heirs and has associated fees. Selling the home can provide a large lump sum but involves transaction costs and the challenges of a new housing market. Experts suggest the best choice depends on individual goals, such as the desire to stay in the home versus relocating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article recounts the personal experience of a writer with a fear of flying who attended a free class taught by a former commercial pilot, "Captain Ron" Nielsen. The class combines practical information about aviation safety with cognitive strategies to manage anxiety, such as breathing exercises and distraction techniques. The session includes a unique form of exposure therapy where participants sit on a stationary airplane. While not a complete cure, the experience provided the author with new tools and a sense of community, making future flights more manageable.</p>

The company noted that visits from this demographic have declined industry-wide. McDonald's is now working with franchisees to develop more affordable options to re-engage these critical consumers.

          <p>Firefighters in Ashcroft, British Columbia, have identified an unusual cause for a recent wildfire: a fish dropped by a bird onto a power line. Investigators believe an osprey caught the fish from a nearby river and accidentally dropped its meal, causing sparks that ignited the dry grass below. The fire department humorously noted the osprey might have been tired or simply wanted its fish cooked. The blaze required approximately 4,800 gallons of water to extinguish, and the charred fish was found at the scene.</p>
