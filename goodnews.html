          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 meticulously recorded the appearance of a new star, later identified as a nova, near the Milky Way. The record describes the star's size, color, and brightness, noting it remained stationary for ten days. This rediscovered account confirms the event as a nova, resolving a debate among modern astronomers. The detailed observations allowed researchers to narrow down the star's possible location. This discovery, published in The Astronomical Journal, highlights the historical contributions of Chinese astronomy.</p>
