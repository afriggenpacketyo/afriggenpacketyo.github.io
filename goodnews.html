          <p>A western Japan zoo has sent all four of its giant pandas back to China, as their loan agreement has expired. The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring from Adventure World in Wakayama Prefecture leaves only two pandas remaining in Japan, both of whom are also scheduled to return to China next year. A farewell ceremony drew around 3,000 people, with many visitors expressing sadness over their departure. The zoo had a successful joint breeding program with a Chinese research base since 1994, raising 17 cubs, the most outside of China.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a link between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, assessed diets that included rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While researchers say more study is needed, they noted that certain foods in the diet, like those rich in omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may help release mood-regulating neurotransmitters. This is one of the first studies of its kind to assess the Japanese diet's impact on mental health.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has successfully captured the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Antoine Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 escape, which officials called the worst in recent state history, has drawn criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. At least 16 people have also been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates, as authorities continue their extensive search for the final escapee.</p>

          <p>The Japanese "fruit sando," or fruit sandwich, has made its debut on UK high street shelves with supermarket M&S launching a limited-edition strawberries and cream version. The sandwich, featuring strawberries and whipped cream cheese in sweetened bread, became the chain's top-selling sandwich shortly after its release. This style of sandwich, popular in Japanese convenience stores and bakeries, recently gained global attention through viral social media trends. Its arrival in the UK highlights the growing influence of Japanese food culture and challenges traditional British notions of what constitutes a sandwich.</p>

          <p>Real-life sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the creators of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," are preparing for their second series. The show, written by Sadler, follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial and relationship struggles with a dark, often taboo sense of humor. The creators say the new series will be even more "depressing, but maybe more funny," continuing to draw inspiration from their own upbringing in an all-woman household. The comedy is known for its unflinching and satirical take on subjects like mental health, abortion, and the "bleak" modern dating scene.</p>

The structure, built in 1908 and vacant for nearly 30 years, is the only surviving imperial Russia-era consulate in Japan. After being purchased by a private corporation in 2021, the building has been restored and will open in July as the six-suite Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate.

Rich in minerals and dietary fiber, the plant has a mild taste and can be eaten raw. Research from Chubu University has suggested the cactus may enhance immune function, adding to its appeal. Proponents also highlight its resilience, as it thrives in dry conditions without pesticides, positioning it as a potential sustainable food source in the face of climate change, a view supported by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>

          <p>Scientists are revisiting a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy as a potential solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. The therapy uses bacteriophages, a type of virus that specifically targets and destroys bacteria, to treat infections. With projections that drug-resistant microbes could kill 10 million people annually by 2050, researchers see phages as a vital alternative. A project at the University of Southampton is actively collecting phage samples from the public, even from household toilets, to build a library of these bacteria-eaters that could one day be used to save lives when conventional antibiotics fail.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent nearly 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates, whom she had known since elementary school but had grown distant from. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had paid more attention to her. Schafer's project served as a powerful, self-initiated effort to bridge social divides and be seen again by her community.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing a prominent law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. The judge declared the order "unconstitutional from beginning to end," marking another significant legal defeat for the administration's campaign against law firms representing clients or causes it opposes. These punitive orders have sought to suspend security clearances and end government contracts with the targeted firms. This series of court rulings represents a strong judicial rebuke of what critics call an unprecedented executive attack on the independence of the legal profession.</p>

While the band was musically tight and the crowd-pleasing set was well-received, some critics noted it felt a bit too safe and lacked the raw energy of previous performances. Healy explained the band's shift in focus, stating they want their legacy to be about "love and friendships" rather than politics.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double its annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total from $330 million to $750 million. This significant increase is a strategic move to keep production within the state and reverse the trend of projects leaving for other locations with more generous credits, such as Canada and Britain. Industry unions and advocates have applauded the decision, arguing it is a crucial step to support workers and the state's economy after losing thousands of entertainment jobs in recent years. The bill is expected to be signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock currently lagging and facing numerous challenges, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to give up on the tech giant. He acknowledged headwinds including steep U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods, a lack of groundbreaking AI announcements, and ongoing App Store litigation. However, Cramer expressed faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and pointed to the company's history of rallying after periods of negativity, suggesting past downturns have been excellent buying opportunities. He argued that Apple's expected 14% earnings growth justifies a higher valuation than it currently holds. (not investment advice)</p>
