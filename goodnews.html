          <p>This article provides an overview of average mortgage and refinance interest rates as of September 23, 2025, according to national data collected by Bankrate. It notes that despite currently high rates and a limited housing inventory, securing affordable options is still possible, especially for borrowers with a strong credit score and overall application. Current average rates include 6.39% for a 30-year mortgage and 6.67% for a 30-year refinance. The article also offers practical advice on how to secure better rates, such as strengthening one's credit profile and shopping around among different lenders, and discusses important factors like loan terms and fees.

          <p>The remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman found dead in 1946, were exhumed in Oregon this week as authorities work to solve the state's oldest unidentified person case. Her dismembered remains were discovered in a burlap sack along the Williamette River, with additional remains and clothing found later that year. Despite national attention, the woman was never identified, and critical evidence went missing in the 1950s. The Oregon State Police's Human Identification Program located her likely burial site, and the exhumation aims to utilize advanced forensic testing to finally identify her and bring resolution to the nearly 80-year-old case.</p>

          <p>A suspect in his 40s has been arrested in southern England in connection with recent cyberattacks that disrupted air travel at several major European airports, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) announced. This arrest, made late Tuesday, is a positive step, though the investigation remains in its early stages. Airports including London's Heathrow, Dublin, Brussels, and Berlin experienced days of disruption due to "third-party ransomware" affecting software from Collins Aerospace, a US defense giant subsidiary. The incident forced airport employees to conduct manual check-ins and baggage drops, leading to numerous delays and cancellations, underscoring the significant and persistent global threat posed by cybercrime.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand stalled last week, rising only 0.6% overall, despite a further drop in interest rates, following a significant 58% surge in refinance demand the week prior. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 6.34%, its lowest since September 2024, though rates saw volatility after a Federal Reserve rate cut. Refinance applications climbed just 1% for the week but remained 42% higher year-over-year, largely driven by government applications like VA refinances. Purchase applications were nearly flat, up 0.3%, indicating that while homebuyer demand remains relatively strong, the market's initial boost from lower rates has slowed. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirement experts advise seniors to plan for several major expenses to ensure financial security, especially in today's economy. Key areas include rising healthcare and long-term care costs, which can be substantial even with Medicare, and housing expenses like insurance, property taxes, and unforeseen maintenance. Retirees also face surprise taxes on Social Security benefits, retirement account withdrawals, and capital gains from home sales, which many underestimate. Finally, everyday expenses can unexpectedly increase in retirement due to more travel or new hobbies. Careful planning and working with a financial professional are crucial to navigating these costs and thriving in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the league could begin renegotiating its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. This move, requiring agreement from current partners like Disney and Comcast, could add billions to the NFL's revenue, driven by the league's status as the most-watched content on traditional television. Goodell acknowledged that the rapidly changing media landscape incentivizes flexibility, and the NFL aims to capitalize on the increasing value of live sports content. This potential acceleration could also impact other sports leagues' media deals and increase the NFL's salary cap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that China has become Southeast Asia's leading external partner, surpassing the United States in influence across the region, largely due to its significant economic clout. The Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Influence Index gives China a one-point lead over the US, identifying it as the most influential power in six of the region's eleven countries. While the region diversifies to avoid dependence on any single power, several nations remain highly exposed to China in sectors like tourism, investment, and trade. China is the region's primary export market and accounts for a substantial portion of its imports, solidifying its economic dominance.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 08:58:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To ensure trustworthy financial advice, individuals should ask prospective advisors if they are a fiduciary, according to financial experts. A fiduciary is legally obligated to act in the client's best interest, a standard not all financial professionals follow, as some adhere only to a "suitability" standard. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher fees and misaligned advice, potentially costing clients tens of thousands of dollars over time. Fiduciaries must disclose conflicts of interest and how they are compensated, creating alignment with client goals. Resources like the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site and professional organizations can help find fee-only, fiduciary advisors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) like Teslas often offer significant fuel cost savings compared to gasoline-powered cars, particularly when contrasted with less efficient vehicles such as a Chevy Silverado pickup truck. This article details a cost breakdown, highlighting that Teslas generally have much better miles per gallon (MPG) equivalent, even when comparing the Cybertruck to electric Silverados. Based on average residential electricity rates and typical monthly driving distances, Tesla owners can expect substantial savings on fuel costs, with the majority of EV charging occurring at home. This comparison underscores a key financial advantage of switching from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles to electric models.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is pushing for an ambitious constitutional reform to allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year limit. The initiative aims to synchronize presidential and National Assembly elections, promoting policy continuity and accountability. However, achieving the required two-thirds parliamentary majority and national referendum approval faces significant opposition, particularly regarding proposed changes on sexual minority rights and North Korea. While many presidents have favored similar reforms, the current political scientist notes the challenges, though polls suggest over 60% public support for these changes, aiming for greater delegation of power within the government.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Donald Trump's "big shift" in rhetoric regarding the Ukraine war following their UN General Assembly meeting, where Trump suggested Ukraine could "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back."

Zelenskyy indicated that Trump now seems "well informed" about the battlefield situation and aligned with Ukraine's intelligence.
