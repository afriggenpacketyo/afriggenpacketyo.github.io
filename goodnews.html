          <p>President Trump has announced that Israel agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with a final proposal to be delivered by Qatar and Egypt. The specifics of the conditions were not detailed, but Trump urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is the best offer they will receive. This development comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and follows a previous ceasefire attempt in March that collapsed. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant casualties on both sides since it began in October 2023.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Mike Tyson is spearheading a crusade for federal marijuana reform, revealing his personal dependence on cannabis for daily function and athletic performance. In a letter to the White House, co-signed by other athletes, Tyson urges President Trump to reschedule marijuana, grant clemency for nonviolent offenders, and reform banking practices for cannabis businesses. He credits cannabis with helping him avoid other drugs and manage his life, stating he was under its influence when he agreed to fight Jake Paul. Tyson believes federal legalization is necessary to ensure product safety and eliminate the black market.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and plans to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." The filing reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a shift to profitability. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee for Figma. The highly anticipated IPO is seen as a positive sign for the tech market, which has seen a recent uptick in public debuts after a prolonged slump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta as the standout performers of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, as all three concluded the first half of the year at all-time highs. Cramer attributes Microsoft's success to its Azure cloud business beating growth expectations, while Nvidia's rally was driven by sustained high demand for its superior AI chips. He noted that Meta's strong performance, fueled by impressive quarterly earnings and robust advertising capabilities, was tougher to explain but equally significant. Cramer suggests these three companies have successfully weathered market volatility that affected their peers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite navigating turbulent U.S. trade policies, China's economy has demonstrated considerable resilience and is on track to meet its annual growth target of around 5%. However, analysts warn that significant challenges remain for the second half of the year. While diversified trade partnerships have helped offset declining shipments to the U.S., experts forecast that export growth will likely slow or even contract. This is attributed to the front-loading of orders earlier in the year and an anticipated slowdown in American consumer spending, indicating an uphill climb for Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay a transfer fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, rather than waiting a month to sign him for free, has already proven financially astute. The right-back provided a crucial assist in the Club World Cup, and the resulting goal secured the team an additional ¬£10 million, more than covering the initial ¬£8.4m fee. While questions about his defensive work remain, his attacking contributions are already making an impact for his new club. The move has given him valuable time to adapt to coach Xabi Alonso's system ahead of major upcoming competitions.</p>

          <p>California has enacted significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in an effort to spur housing development. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas zoned for multifamily use. For decades, the law has been used by opponents, including neighborhood groups and labor unions, to delay or block construction projects through lengthy studies and lawsuits. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, this change removes a key point of leverage used to stifle development.</p>

While a remarkable milestone for the social media star, the WBA's decision is seen by some as reflecting Paul's immense financial drawing power more than his traditional boxing credentials.

          <p>In a personal column, a writer reflects on the nature of long-term relationships through the lens of a road trip with her husband. She humorously details his habit of arguing with navigation apps and personifying other drivers, contrasting it with his otherwise rational and kind nature. The piece suggests that navigating these small, recurring annoyances is a microcosm of marriage itself. Ultimately, the columnist concludes that, like a road trip, a successful marriage requires accepting a partner's quirks and finding ways to "proceed to the route" together, despite the inevitable frustrations along the way.</p>
