          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are leading a bipartisan effort to pass a sanctions bill aimed at giving President Trump powerful tools to pressure Russia over its war in Ukraine. The legislation, which has 85 cosponsors, would allow for tariffs up to 500% on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's economy by purchasing its goods. Graham described the measure as a "sledgehammer" to compel Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, noting that the president's patience with Russia is wearing thin. The move signals a potential major escalation in economic pressure from Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been repurposed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery by founder Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt undertook an eight-year renovation to create the Cookie Factory gallery, which opened in May. Her mission is to provide a space for community connection and mental wellness through art, inspired by her own healing experiences.

          <p>Following the catastrophic floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has stated that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is advocating for a major federal investment in forecasting technology to provide earlier and more accurate alerts for extreme weather events like floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes. Cantwell plans to send President Trump bipartisan recommendations to upgrade infrastructure, including Doppler radar and ocean buoys, to prevent future tragedies. She emphasized that a robust national system is crucial, rather than a community-by-community approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that comes as the administration signals a new strategy to arm Ukraine. The plan involves selling U.S.-made weapons to NATO allies, who can then transfer their existing, compatible equipment to Ukraine more quickly. This approach is part of what Senator Lindsey Graham calls a "turning point" in the U.S. stance on the war, combining military support with the threat of severe economic sanctions against Russia and its backers. The meeting underscores a renewed, unified effort to counter Russian aggression.</p>
