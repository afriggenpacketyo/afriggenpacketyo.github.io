        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal, aiming to conclude the two-year conflict. This initial agreement stipulates that Hamas will release all remaining hostages, including the bodies of deceased captives, while Israel will withdraw its forces to a designated line. The deal, confirmed by Israeli officials, Hamas, and mediators like Qatar, is a crucial step following intense negotiations. Hostage releases are anticipated to commence as early as Monday, with procedural details still being finalized. The article highlights the ongoing challenges, such as future governance of Gaza and Hamas's potential demilitarization, as part of a broader 20-point peace plan.</p>

          <p>A durable ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas could mark President Trump's most significant diplomatic achievement, despite the murky details and sequencing. While the first phase involves hostage returns and a limited Israeli withdrawal, critical questions regarding Hamas's future, disarmament, and Gaza's long-term governance remain unresolved. The article highlights the intense political pressure and the desire for a Nobel Peace Prize as driving factors behind the accelerated negotiations. Concerns persist that Israel might resume its offensive after hostage releases, and Palestinian statehood aspirations are largely unaddressed. This article emphasizes the precariousness of the agreement and the substantial challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a multi-agency manhunt and brief standoff. Groves, a convicted violent offender facing a life sentence for murder, was found in a crawl space after a SWAT team deployed gas canisters. His arrest concludes a months-long effort that began after the inmates fled through a hole behind a toilet. This article details the capture, the charges Groves faces, and the relief expressed by Louisiana officials, who emphasized the breach of public safety and the significant resources expended to bring him to justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan aims to end the Israel-Hamas war, outlining an immediate ceasefire, phased Israeli withdrawal, and the release of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The article details the proposal for a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" to govern Gaza, overseen by an "International Stabilization Force" and a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. It also addresses the demilitarization of Gaza, the provision of aid, and a vague aspiration for Palestinian self-determination.

          <p>During a Supreme Court hearing, both conservative and liberal justices expressed skepticism towards a case challenging Illinois voting regulations, brought by a Republican congressman who won his election.
