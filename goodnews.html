The schedule poses immediate tests for Liverpool, with games against Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City before international breaks, which could impact England's national team preparations. The league has also acknowledged the increased likelihood of fixture changes due to the participation of nine teams in European competitions, especially the Champions League, adding complexity to the scheduling process. Manchester City's new player, Rayan Cherki, will have an early opportunity to play against Manchester United.</p>

          <p>The Leo Baeck Institute (LBI) is commemorating its 70th anniversary, marking seven decades of preserving and promoting German-Jewish cultural heritage. Founded in 1955 by Jewish intellectuals, including Hannah Arendt, the LBI aimed to safeguard German-Jewish culture following the Holocaust. The institute, named after Rabbi Leo Baeck, has become a crucial research center with branches in New York, London, and Jerusalem. It houses a vast collection of digitized historical objects, including books, letters, and artwork, making them accessible to scholars and descendants worldwide. The LBI also engages in various projects, such as podcasts and publications, to maintain interest in German-Jewish heritage, while facing challenges from attacks on academic life and the rise of right-wing parties.</p>

          <p>Boeing's senior vice-president, Turbo Sjogren, emphasized the need for Europe to reduce its reliance on China for critical minerals, mirroring similar concerns in the United States. Sjogren highlighted the global nature of the aerospace supply chain, noting that no single entity can operate independently. He pointed out that US legislation since 1973 has aimed to prevent dependence on countries like China for critical materials in the aerospace and defense sectors. Sjogren suggested that collaboration between the US and Europe is essential for developing programs with significant content from both regions, making self-sufficiency impractical and costly.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed U.S. President Donald Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, without U.S. mediation. During a phone call, Modi clarified that there were no discussions about an India-U.S. trade deal or U.S. involvement in the ceasefire process between the April 22 attack and the May 10 ceasefire. Modi emphasized India's consistent policy of rejecting third-party mediation, particularly concerning the disputed region of Kashmir.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower duty payments amid rising tariffs, which involves modifying products to fit into categories with lower rates. This practice includes altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to align with different 'harmonized system codes.' For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into products to qualify for lower duties, while others remove these elements when tariffs change. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have successfully used strategic product tweaks, such as adding pockets to clothing or using fuzzy-felt soles on shoes, to reduce tariff costs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a wild 8-6 victory over the San Diego Padres in a game marked by high tensions, including two hit batters and the ejection of Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. Roberts was ejected after arguing the umpire's decision to issue warnings to both dugouts following Shohei Ohtani being hit by a pitch. Andy Pages delivered a standout performance, hitting two home runs and an RBI single, while Will Smith contributed a two-run homer. The game also featured controversial umpire calls and heated exchanges between players and managers.</p>
