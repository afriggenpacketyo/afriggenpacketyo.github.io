          <p>A recent phone call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has offered a temporary respite for Asian countries caught between the U.S. and China. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, signals a potential easing of tensions after weeks of worsening relations. This development could simplify the calculations of countries that rely on trade with both powers, but the relationship between the two superpowers remains fragile. The call is considered a diplomatic breakthrough after heightened trade hostilities.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong continues to be China's primary hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai due to its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. Despite the presence of mainland exchanges, companies are increasingly turning to Hong Kong for capital infusions. The city's appeal is further bolstered by its business-friendly environment and established legal framework. Recent geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, have also made Hong Kong a more attractive option for Chinese companies seeking offshore listings.</p>
