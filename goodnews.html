          <p>This opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant to become parents, noting the record-low fertility rate in the U.S. The author suggests that in addition to financial concerns, career aspirations, and climate change worries, millennials may be dreading parenthood because they hold their own parents to impossibly high standards. This new standard includes providing not only basic needs but also ensuring their children's career success and mental well-being into adulthood.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift announced that she has reacquired the masters of her first six studio albums, which were previously sold to Scooter Braun and Shamrock Capital. She has released four rerecorded albums and expressed excitement about owning her music again. Swift revealed that she has finished rerecording her debut album and shared details about the "Reputation" album, stating that she has not even rerecorded a quarter of that album yet and that it was difficult to remake because the original was so specific to that time in her life.</p>

          <h2>Jacqueline Wilson on Tracy Beaker</h2>

          <p>Jacqueline Wilson expressed reluctance to write about Tracy Beaker as an adult, fearing it would be inappropriate to explore her sex life. She has touched on Beaker's adult life through her daughter Jess in children's books, but an adult-focused book is unlikely. Wilson enjoys revisiting characters once they've grown up, as seen in her adult fiction book "Think Again," a continuation of her "Girls in Love" novels. Wilson is known for addressing difficult topics in accessible ways for children.</p>

          <p>The UK Treasury has announced the sale of its final shares in the NatWest Group, marking the end of government ownership nearly two decades after the bank's bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. While the sale represents a loss of approximately ¬£10 billion for taxpayers, the article explores whether banks are now safer from collapse. Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, asserts that banks are now better equipped to handle crises without public money, though cyber risks remain a growing concern.

          <h2>Presidential Runoff in Poland: A Matter of Choosing the Lesser Evil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 12:32:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The upcoming presidential runoff in Poland pits Rafal Trzaskowski against Karol Nawrocki, with many voters viewing the election as a choice between the "lesser of two evils." Polish voters in Germany, who tend to be more liberal and pro-European, favor Trzaskowski, while right-wing candidates have also gained traction, reflecting a wariness of the established two-party system. The election is seen as crucial for Prime Minister Tusk's government to push through reforms currently blocked by the incumbent president.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri led the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix as McLaren set the pace in Barcelona, while a new front-wing flexibility test introduced by the FIA became a central talking point. The test aims to reduce teams' ability to use flexing wings to control aerodynamic performance. Red Bull and Ferrari hope the tougher restrictions will boost their competitiveness, while McLaren believes it will have little impact on their performance.</p>
