          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:57:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The D.C. city council has reached an amended stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders football team, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former name. Council chairman Phil Mendelson expressed confidence that the proposal will pass, framing the president's comments as a distraction. The deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, aims to bring the team back to the RFK Stadium site. While the plan still faces challenges, including a final council vote and the transfer of federal land, it has garnered widespread local support.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service operates a unique Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, dedicated to deciphering poorly handwritten addresses on mail. When automated systems fail to read an address, an image is sent to this facility, where hundreds of expert 'keyers' work around the clock to determine the correct destination. This center processes images for approximately one billion pieces of mail annually, ensuring that even letters with the most challenging penmanship have a chance to reach their intended recipient. The process is a crucial, human-powered step in the nation's complex mail delivery system.</p>

          <p>Following his death at 71, this article reflects on Hulk Hogan's significant and complex legacy in shaping modern popular culture. Terry Bollea, as Hogan, transformed professional wrestling into a global phenomenon in the 1980s by pioneering a new brand of celebrity built on patriotism and bravado. His career set a template for reality television stardom, brand management, and navigating public scandals, from steroid use to a racism controversy that led to his temporary cancellation. The piece argues that Hogan's influence, both positive and negative, is deeply embedded in today's celebrity and political landscapes, making him a pivotal figure of his era.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing new federal rules for name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing in college sports. The order aims to create guardrails for what the White House terms an "out-of-control" system by banning third-party, pay-for-play payments while still allowing brand endorsements. It also mandates that universities with high athletic revenues must maintain or increase scholarships for non-revenue and women's sports. The move seeks to bring federal oversight to the rapidly commercializing landscape of collegiate athletics, which has been reshaped by recent court rulings and NCAA policy changes.</p>

The program will utilize existing parish networks and is funded by donations, including a significant contribution from businessman Rick Caruso. This action provides direct relief to a vulnerable population and underscores the profound impact of federal immigration enforcement on local communities.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress and singer Renée Rapp reflected on her reputation for being unfiltered and outspoken during media appearances. The 'Mean Girls' star explained that she finds traditional media training boring and prefers authentic conversations, even if it makes her PR team anxious. Rapp also discussed the immense pressure and depression she experienced last year while being pushed to quickly produce new music after a successful tour. Her new single, 'Leave Me Alone,' was born from this frustration and serves as a defiant response to those trying to manage her image.</p>

          <p>Four former traders convicted in the Libor rate-rigging scandal are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a major Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were found to have been wrongly prosecuted for what were considered normal commercial practices at the time. The scandal involved banks manipulating key inter-bank lending rates for profit, a major issue highlighted during the 2008 financial crisis. This development could lead to the unraveling of several high-profile convictions secured by the Serious Fraud Office.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are already making strategic media appearances, signaling the unofficial start of the 2028 presidential race. This article observes a shift in strategy, with potential candidates engaging with non-traditional and ideologically diverse platforms like podcasts hosted by Joe Rogan and Barstool Sports to reach a broader audience. These appearances also feature a rhetorical shift toward the political center, with figures like Emanuel and Newsom making comments on transgender issues that break from progressive orthodoxy. The moves suggest an early effort to redefine the party's image following its 2024 loss.</p>

          <p>Despite massive capital expenditures, CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that major tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are underspending on artificial intelligence. He contends that the AI race is a 'winner-take-all' situation, and to secure dominance, even greater investment is necessary. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased spending on cloud infrastructure to power AI, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and essential for future profitability. He believes the company that develops the most accurate AI, particularly in chatbots, will achieve a near-monopoly similar to Google's dominance in search. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As regulators like the U.S. FDA move to ban artificial food dyes such as Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are innovating to create stable, vibrant colors from natural sources. Companies are exploring microalgae, specialized carrots, and potatoes to produce pigments that can replace petroleum-based synthetic dyes. This shift presents challenges, as natural colors must match the vividness and shelf-life of their artificial counterparts. Major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to phase out artificial colors, creating a surge in demand for these new, natural alternatives in the food industry.</p>

After two stellar seasons, including setting multiple rookie records, Nacua has become one of the NFL's best bargains, earning just over $1 million this year. With other young receivers securing deals worth over $90 million, a strong 2025 season could lead to a massive payday for the former fifth-round draft pick.
