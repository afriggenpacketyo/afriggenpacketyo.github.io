          <p>A small plane carrying 15 people for a skydiving trip crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring fourteen individuals. Three people were critically injured and airlifted to a hospital after the pilot reported engine trouble and attempted to return to the airport. Officials noted it was remarkable there were no fatalities, attributing the effective emergency response to a recent mass casualty training exercise at the same airport. The NTSB is investigating the crash of the Cessna 208B, the same aircraft involved in a non-fatal landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new home-grown turbine designed for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station in Tibet, setting a new world record for single-unit capacity at 500 megawatts. Developed by Harbin Electric Machinery Company, the 80-tonne turbine is described as the "heart" of the hydropower unit and is constructed from durable, corrosion-resistant martensitic steel. This technological advancement is part of a project on the Yuqu River, a tributary of the Nu River.

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic revival, with new listing volumes soaring to $14 billion in the first half of 2025, an eightfold increase from the previous year. This surge, driven by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. Factors fueling the boom include regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and fears of delisting from U.S. markets. High-profile listings like battery maker CATL's $5 billion offering underscore the renewed confidence in Hong Kong's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A piece of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737 was discovered in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The plane, Delta Flight 3247 from Atlanta, had landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Tuesday night with 109 passengers and six crew members. An inspection after landing revealed the missing part, and the FAA has since confirmed the discovered piece belongs to that aircraft.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that hormone therapy combining estrogen and progestin for menopause symptoms may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55. Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, appears to reduce the risk. This research refines understanding from earlier studies, emphasizing that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Medical experts advise that while hormone therapy is effective for many menopausal symptoms, individuals should consult their doctors to weigh the personal risks and benefits.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down the Trump administration's policy that banned migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled that the president exceeded his authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws passed by Congress. The ruling, which the judge stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, was praised by immigrant rights groups like the ACLU as a critical affirmation that the president must adhere to existing immigration statutes.</p>

The concert, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being hailed as a major event in rock history, celebrating the band that forged the sound of heavy metal.

Despite the defeat, head coach Pia Sundhage remains optimistic about her team's chances of reaching the quarter-finals.
