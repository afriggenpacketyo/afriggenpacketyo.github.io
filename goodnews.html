          <p>The global interest in deep-sea mining for valuable metals and rare earths is surging, with the US actively exploring this frontier, while China faces its own challenges. Despite the vast potential of ocean deposits like polymetallic nodules, commercial exploitation is currently stalled due to a critical lack of legal clarity and significant environmental concerns. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body, is responsible for developing a comprehensive mining code. However, the finalization of these essential legal, environmental, and operational regulations has been hampered by widespread environmental objections, preventing the full-scale development of this potentially lucrative industry.

          <p>A 54-year-old man attempting a challenging 20-plus mile marathon swim from Santa Catalina Island to San Pedro was bitten by a 3-to-4-foot shark early Tuesday morning. The "rare attack" caused non-life-threatening injuries to the swimmer's leg and foot, as reported by Los Angeles Fire Department officials. The individual was conscious and communicative upon rescue, subsequently transported to a non-trauma facility for treatment. This unusual incident occurred about 12 miles off Catalina, during a long-distance solo swimming competition, and authorities expressed relief that the injuries were fortunately minor given the nature of the encounter.</p>

          <p>China is aggressively advancing its robotics sector, aiming to secure independence in core artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Last year, Chinese factories installed nearly 300,000 new robots, exceeding the combined total of the rest of the world. This strategic initiative, underpinned by extensive long-term policy frameworks such as Made in China 2025, is generating significant domestic demand for sophisticated embodied intelligence. Major players like Huawei are actively open-sourcing AI computing toolkits and developing indigenous AI chips. This concerted public-private effort seeks to build a complete and resilient physical AI supply chain, embedding robotics deeply into the national economy and society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for workers on residential construction projects to over $32 an hour, plus an additional $7.65 per hour healthcare credit. This motion aims to attract and retain workers in an industry facing labor shortages, especially as the city rebuilds after the Palisades fire and workers leave due to fears of immigration raids. Backers argue that increased wages and benefits are crucial to protect non-union, often foreign-born, construction workers who are vulnerable to wage theft and exploitation within multi-layered contracting systems. The study will analyze the economic effects of implementing such a policy.</p>

Despite the revenue increase, profits fell 31% and gross margin dropped 3.2 percentage points, signaling that the company is still actively clearing old inventory. CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged progress in wholesale, running, and North America, but noted struggles in other areas like Nike Direct sales and the crucial China market. The company is restructuring its corporate framework and focusing on innovation and sports to regain market share, a strategy that involves short-term profitability impacts.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration, specifically Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian students for deportation. The judge delivered a scathing 161-page decision, asserting that officials misused their powers to chill lawful speech and that President Trump approved of this "scandalous and unconstitutional suppression." The ruling detailed how the administration pursued targeted deportation proceedings against student activists, even deploying masked agents for detentions. This landmark decision reaffirms First Amendment protections for non-citizen students and critiques the administration's actions as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law, making it one of the strongest US AI regulations. This bill requires developers of powerful "frontier" AI models, like ChatGPT and Gemini, to publish safety frameworks and security reports before deployment. It also mandates reporting "critical safety incidents" and establishes whistleblower protections for employees. The law primarily targets "catastrophic risks" such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks causing significant casualties or damages. While some critics argue it may stifle innovation, proponents believe it's a crucial step to regulate fast-moving AI before widespread disasters occur.</p>
