          <p>An architect in Phoenix is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and cost-effective housing solutions for the city's unhoused population. The project, developed with Steel + Spark, features "X-WING" shelters that can be constructed in just one week and are equipped with solar panels and air conditioning. This initiative provides residents with their own private, cool space, which is crucial in Phoenix's extreme heat. The architect's long-term goal is to expand this model to address the broader affordable housing crisis, including building a 105-unit complex for low-income seniors.</p>

          <h2>Immigration Arrests Declined in July, with Activist Efforts Potentially a Contributing Factor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 11:38:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows a 13% decrease in immigration arrests nationwide in July compared to the previous month. Activists and protest groups, particularly in places like Portland, Oregon, believe their efforts may be contributing to this slowdown. In Oregon, a combination of nightly protests outside the ICE field office and a "rapid response" legal aid system complicates large-scale enforcement actions. The state's "sanctuary" law, which limits cooperation between local and federal authorities, is also cited as a significant factor in the lower arrest numbers observed in the region.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. This victory serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who narrowly lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Despite the loss, Lyles expressed confidence, viewing the performance as a positive step toward the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive and rescue team located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by the California Highway Patrol and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A top scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States in this emerging sector. The technology involves building large solar arrays in orbit that convert sunlight into electricity and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers. Unlike ground-based solar, space-based systems can generate power continuously without being affected by weather or nighttime. The academic argues for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current limitations of university-led research and close the technological gap with the U.S.</p>

          <p>This article collection explores the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence, offering support and safety without controlling every aspect of a child's life. While the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, experts argue that this can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The articles suggest that allowing children to navigate their own struggles, with the parent as a reliable beacon, fosters greater independence.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he placed on an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously forfeited by Tate and his brother after they failed to pay taxes on £21 million in revenue from their online businesses. The confiscated funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives in the local community.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many former foster youth arrive on campus with minimal belongings, often unaware of what they need to furnish a sparse dorm room. The initiative, which began in 2018, hosts an annual event where students can select their own bedding, towels, and other necessities, giving them a sense of ownership and helping them feel equal to their peers. The program aims to level the playing field and provide a support network for a successful transition to higher education.</p>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to ground oneself for the day. Her one non-negotiable rule is waking up when her alarm goes off, no matter what, as this prevents feeling rushed and chaotic. This extra time allows for self-care activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, which are unrelated to work or chores. She advises against overly rigid routines, suggesting that allowing flexibility within this protected time helps generate creativity and avoids starting the day with a sense of failure.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's long-held dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter as Apple's declined. This shift is largely attributed to Samsung's innovation in foldable screen technology and its strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points. The popularity of models like the Z Fold 7 is pressuring Apple, which has maintained a similar form factor for years. Analysts expect Apple to respond with a slimmer iPhone and potentially its own foldable device by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The messages linked him to trafficking AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting.

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy offers three powerful steps to develop emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative feelings. First, she suggests using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning is a process that occurs in the often-frustrating space between not knowing and knowing. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as part of the learning journey. Finally, undertake small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds tolerance for discomfort and boosts confidence over time.</p>

This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with teen drinking rates dropping significantly over the past few decades.
