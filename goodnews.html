          <p>China and Kuwait are enhancing their military relationship, highlighted by the imminent opening of a joint ammunition factory. According to Kuwait's deputy defense minister, this project marks a significant milestone in their cooperation. The two nations also plan to expand their joint military training programs, which began in 2019. This deepening of ties builds on a military cooperation agreement first signed in 1995, reflecting China's increasing engagement in the Gulf region, which has traditionally been a key area of U.S. influence.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's updated tariff schedule, which brings varied economic implications across the region. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief over receiving lower rates than initially announced, viewing it as a positive development for their economies. In contrast, Taiwan faces a 20% temporary tariff pending further negotiations, while India, having not secured a deal, is set to face a 25% duty. The reactions highlight the significant impact of U.S. trade policy on the economic stability and competitiveness of its Asian partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of its emergency docket, which has seen a surge in appeals from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, legal challenges inevitably follow, requiring the court's intervention. He acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its processes. He emphasized the collegiality among the justices despite their differing views on difficult issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for individuals who were facing the loss of their legal status and work permits, some of whom have lived in the U.S. for decades. In a strongly worded order, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was motivated by racial animus and did not properly consider current conditions in those countries.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion. While this growth slightly exceeded analyst expectations, it reflects intensifying competition from rivals Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates. AWS remains a significant profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that AWS is still substantially larger than its competitors and highlighted the company's focus on security to protect sensitive customer data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite having a small chance of making the playoffs, the Los Angeles Angels chose to be "buyers" at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring several veteran players rather than trading assets to rebuild for the future. General manager Perry Minasian explained the decision was made to give the team's young core a chance to play meaningful, competitive games in August and September. He believes this experience is crucial for their development, regardless of the final outcome this season. The move contrasts with other teams in the wild-card race who made more significant trades.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to build a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the White House grounds. President Trump stated the new facility is needed to host large-scale events, which currently require the use of tents on the South Lawn that are impractical in bad weather. The project, which will replace the current East Wing, is slated to be funded by President Trump himself and other "patriot donors." This would be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the potato's ancestor is, surprisingly, the tomato. Scientists determined that the modern potato originated around 9 million years ago from a hybridization event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancient tomato. This ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to create starchy tubers, a trait absent in its other parent. By analyzing hundreds of potato genomes, researchers were able to solve the long-standing puzzle of the popular vegetable's origin.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has reacted with temporary relief to the announcement of a 20% U.S. tariff on its exports, a rate lower than the 32% that was initially feared. However, this relief is tempered by concerns that the island will be pressured to make significant concessions to secure a more favorable, long-term trade deal. The 20% tariff is set to take effect on August 7, leaving a short window for further negotiations. Analysts suggest the revised rate may be a strategic move by Washington to de-escalate tensions related to Taiwan. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is seen as a significant step in telling a more complete story of the state's history, as the Capitol grounds are currently dominated by statues of white men, many with ties to the Confederacy.</p>
