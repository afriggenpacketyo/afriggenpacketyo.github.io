          <p>As the UK Labour Party's popularity declines, this article explores potential lessons from the success of Zohran Mamdani, a progressive Democratic nominee for mayor in New York. Mamdani's campaign has gained significant traction by focusing intently on economic issues like affordability, housing, and a higher minimum wage, resonating with voters' daily experiences. His strategy involves presenting clear, costed policies and crafting a compelling narrative that positions him as an agent of change against a broken system. The analysis suggests that Labour could benefit from adopting a similar approach of championing popular, practical policies and developing a clear, overarching story to connect with the electorate.</p>

          <p>Amid a heavy Russian missile attack on Kyiv, Ukrainian doctors undertook a perilous journey to perform a life-saving heart transplant for 12-year-old Kira Skliarova. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team from the Kyiv Heart Institute drove through the besieged city to retrieve a donor heart from a 4-year-old girl who had died in an accident. The surgical team then successfully completed the transplant as explosions shook their hospital building. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by childhood pneumonia, is now recovering, offering a powerful story of resilience and medical dedication in the midst of war.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, a pastor and lawyer reflects on his close friendship with the late conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, portraying him as a master tactician with a deep, underlying kindness. The author recounts his first appearance on Kirk's show, which led to a collaborative relationship and extensive travel across the country. He describes Kirk as a man of profound Christian faith, which was central to his life, not merely a public persona. The article concludes that Kirk's life and death will inspire a new generation of God-fearing young Americans, ensuring his legacy and the influence of Turning Point USA will continue to grow.</p>

          <p>This article presents a curated list of five nonfiction books that offer the compelling narrative drive and engaging characters typically associated with fiction. The recommendations from The Atlantic's staff include Patricia Lockwood's surreal memoir "Priestdaddy," which chronicles her return to her eccentric parents' home. Also featured are Åsne Seierstad's "One of Us," a haunting account of the 2011 Norway terrorist attacks, and Patrick Radden Keefe's "Say Nothing," a propulsive murder mystery set during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

          <p>Sushila Karki, Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, has vowed to end corruption and restore good governance after taking office following violent youth-led protests that ousted her predecessor. The demonstrations, which left at least 72 people dead, were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations. Karki, a former chief justice whose name was put forward by activists on the Discord app, stated her government will align with the demands of the "Gen Z generation." She has promised to hold power for no more than six months, with new elections scheduled for March 5.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have captured the first-ever footage of the rare sliteye shark in the protected waters of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Researchers from Swansea University made the discovery using underwater camera systems while tracking green sea turtles via satellite. The shark was observed in deepwater seagrass habitats, providing new insights into its environment and highlighting the ecological importance of these lesser-known ecosystems. The sighting is considered a positive sign for conservation, as it suggests that marine protected areas can serve as vital refuges for threatened species like the sliteye shark, whose population is declining due to overfishing.</p>

          <p>As President Trump undertakes a state visit to the U.K., this article explores the life of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, an immigrant from the Isle of Lewis in Scotland. Born in 1912, she was one of ten siblings who left a life of poverty for opportunities in America, a form of family-based migration that the Trump administration has sought to curtail. She arrived in New York as a teenager, worked as a domestic servant, and later married real estate developer Fred Trump. Her story is presented as a classic "rags to riches" tale that embodies the American dream, creating a stark contrast with her son's hardline immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's government-run tech incubator, Cyberport, is considering incorporating Chinese-made graphics processing units (GPUs) into its new Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre. The move is aimed at diversifying its hardware and reducing its reliance on chips from U.S. firm Nvidia amid ongoing Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Cyberport's CEO stated that the facility has already acquired and is testing GPUs from four different mainland Chinese manufacturers. While the center's initial 3,000 petaflops of computing power currently depend on Nvidia's H800 chips, future procurements will likely include Chinese alternatives to ensure supply chain resilience.

          <p>A primary school in the Chinese city of Heihe, located on the border with Russia, has experienced a significant increase in the number of Russian students. This year, 127 new Russian children enrolled, bringing the total to 216, a reflection of the strengthening people-to-people ties between the two nations. Many of the students commute daily from the neighboring Russian city of Blagoveshchensk, a trip that takes about 20 minutes. To accommodate the influx, the school has organized dedicated cross-border transportation and translation services, underscoring a deepening of local-level Sino-Russian relations.</p>

          <p>The Little Arboreal Ladybird, a species typically found in continental Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. Scientists from Wild New Forest discovered the insects in moth traps across the New Forest and Southampton area, attributing their arrival to the hot summer weather. This colonization is part of a broader trend of winged insects moving northward into southern England due to warming temperatures. The discovery is seen as a positive sign of the New Forest's high-quality habitat, which serves as a welcoming landing point for new species expanding their range due to climate change.</p>

          <p>The National Gallery in London has announced plans to construct a new wing after receiving £375 million in pledges from private donors, including two of the largest single cash donations ever reported by a global museum. The expansion will be built on the last remaining part of the gallery's Trafalgar Square campus and aims to revitalize the surrounding area. An international architectural competition has been launched to design the new space, which will house an expanded collection. This major development project marks the beginning of the gallery's third century and will support new collaborations with the Tate and other museums worldwide.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary working father, Robert Andrews Jr., was unmasked as the head of a multi-million pound cocaine and heroin empire in South Wales after police discovered incriminating WhatsApp messages on another dealer's phone. The chats, where he joked about becoming a millionaire or sharing a cell, sparked a covert surveillance operation that caught him conducting brazen drug deals. Despite his modest lifestyle, Andrews Jr. was managing an industrial-scale operation, making payments of over £650,000 in just two weeks. He has been sentenced to over 14 years in prison, with key members of his network also receiving significant jail time.</p>
