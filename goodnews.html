          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that new investors should consider buying Broadcom, despite a slight dip in its stock price following a strong quarterly earnings report, citing the company's impressive AI business and long-term potential. He notes that Apple's stock is becoming less risky, especially with the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference where updates on its AI system, Apple Intelligence, are expected. Cramer acknowledges the challenges Apple has faced, including the rocky rollout of its AI features, but believes the stock has the potential to bounce back. He also briefly discussed Lululemon, McDonald's, MP Materials, and Applied Materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington refutes Elon Musk's assertion that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is filled with "pork." Arrington explains that the budget reconciliation process does not involve discretionary spending or earmarks, which are typically associated with pork barrel spending. He clarifies that the bill deals with mandatory spending programs, such as entitlements, healthcare, welfare, and the tax code. Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller echoed this, stating that the bill cuts taxes, secures the border, and reforms welfare, with no pork included.</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 139,000 jobs in May, surpassing economists' forecasts and indicating a steady labor market despite economic challenges from tariffs. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2% for the third consecutive month. While job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, the data suggests resilience in the face of ongoing uncertainty. Health care, leisure, and hospitality sectors saw the largest employment gains, while federal employment declined. The report is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines regarding interest rate cuts for the next few months.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound after a significant drop fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that the stock was oversold due to the conflict, and a potential truce between Musk and Trump could further boost investor confidence. Despite the recent volatility, analysts remain optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly regarding its push into autonomous vehicles. Musk's net worth had taken a hit due to the previous day's stock decline, but the rebound is helping to recover some of those losses.</p>

          <p>The absence of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio from preparations for the phone call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as subsequent trade talk announcements, has sparked questions about his influence on U.S.-China relations. The call, which followed a 90-day truce, has rekindled hopes of easing tensions over tariffs and rare earth minerals. Observers note a shift in Washington's approach to China, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's preference for personal deal-making, suggesting a diminished role for Rubio in shaping bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) could significantly alter entry-level jobs for recent college graduates, potentially eliminating or reshaping positions in white-collar fields. Advances in AI-fueled chatbots and automation may lead to fewer opportunities at the bottom of the career ladder. While current job market challenges for graduates may also stem from economic conditions and trade policies, the capacity of AI to perform written and computational tasks poses a risk to certain entry-level roles. However, some analysts believe that AI-native young workers will adapt and find new opportunities in AI-integrated jobs.</p>
