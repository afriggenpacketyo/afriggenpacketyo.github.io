          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election, defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. The election took place after months of political turbulence, including an annulled presidential race due to claims of Russian interference.

Despite Simion's strong support among diaspora voters, Dan secured victory with 53.6% of the vote.
