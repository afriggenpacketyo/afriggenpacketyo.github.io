          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that China is merely "nanoseconds behind" the United States in semiconductor technology, urging Washington to allow its tech industry to compete globally. Speaking on a podcast, Huang emphasized China's rapid progress, deep talent pool, and competitive internal market, describing it as a vibrant and modern high-tech industry. He argued that fostering global competition is essential for maximizing America's economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang also expressed his belief that it is in China's best interest to remain open to foreign investment and competition.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 over data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous objections by making the system optional and keeping it entirely state-run, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, from signing contracts to age verification. Despite Switzerland's strong tradition of privacy protection, recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital credentials from the pandemic, may approve the measure this time.</p>

          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support the company and its suppliers after a cyberattack halted production for weeks. The shutdown has raised concerns that smaller firms in the supply chain could face bankruptcy, threatening thousands of jobs. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan guarantee is intended to provide certainty and help JLR manage payments as it works to recover from the hack attributed to the group "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters." This is reportedly the first time a UK company has received such government assistance as a direct result of a cyberattack. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Zurich Residents to Vote on Banning Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 02:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If the measure passes, gas-powered devices will be completely banned, and electric models will only be permitted for three months of the year. Supporters of the ban argue the machines are loud, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents contend that the proposal is an example of an "anti-social culture of prohibition" that would create unnecessary difficulties for residents and maintenance workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour Party has pledged that construction on three new towns will commence before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified 12 potential locations in England, with Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London being the most promising initial sites. The plan involves creating development corporations with special planning powers to fast-track the projects, which are expected to deliver at least 10,000 homes each. The party has also welcomed the recommendation that at least 40% of these new homes be classified as affordable housing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to require a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications could inadvertently benefit the Middle East, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia. As these Gulf nations invest billions to become global AI hubs, they are creating a business-friendly environment with long-term visas and high compensation packages to attract top talent. Investors note that the region's cosmopolitan lifestyle and large-scale, innovative projects are increasingly appealing to skilled professionals from Silicon Valley. This shift could intensify the global war for tech talent, with the Gulf gaining a competitive edge over the US and Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season, a point of focus for head coach Eddie Howe. The club hired specialist coach Martin Mark from Danish club Midtjylland to improve this aspect of their game, which has led to tactical shifts like an increased use of long throws. However, the team has only scored once from a corner or free-kick this season. As they prepare to face Arsenal, a team that has been highly effective from set-pieces, Newcastle's ability to capitalize on these dead-ball situations remains a key area for improvement.</p>

          <p>In response to Donald Trump's recent contentious claims about autism, this opinion column argues that autistic people embody many positive traits that the former president lacks. The author highlights qualities such as the capacity for intense focus, adherence to facts, and a profound sense of empathy and social justice, citing Greta Thunberg as an example. The piece challenges the narrative of autism as a tragedy, instead celebrating the unique ways autistic individuals experience and express joy, memory, and love. It concludes that these human qualities are more valuable than the divisive rhetoric used by some politicians.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are grappling with several key roster decisions for their upcoming wild-card playoff series, primarily centered on player health and bullpen composition. The availability of key players like Max Muncy and Will Smith remains uncertain due to injuries, while the team evaluates a surplus of left-handed relievers. Manager Dave Roberts is also considering how to best utilize two-way star Shohei Ohtani, either as a Game 1 starter or saving him for a potential later game. These final choices will be critical for the team's postseason aspirations.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking new steps to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by erecting a monument to the victims of the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. The incident, where a mob of white miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned their neighborhood, is one of the deadliest acts of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history. The new seven-foot bronze statue, "Requiem," was unveiled on the 140th anniversary, representing a significant shift from the previously small and overlooked plaque. This public reckoning is bringing descendants of the victims back to the town for the first time.</p>
