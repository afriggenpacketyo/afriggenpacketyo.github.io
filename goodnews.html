          <p>Google has entered into an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, each with a capacity of at least 600 megawatts, to meet the increasing energy demands of data centers, particularly with the rise of AI. Google will provide early-stage capital for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations, with the option to purchase power once the sites are operational. This collaboration aims to add 10 gigawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2035, aligning with the growing need for reliable, baseload energy to support AI and technological innovation. Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Google, emphasized the importance of advanced nuclear technology in strengthening power grids and meeting the demands of AI advancements.</p>

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving office, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. criticized President Trump's handling of the war in Ukraine, his dealings with global allies, and defended the timing of his withdrawal from the 2024 campaign. Biden expressed concern over Trump's approach to international relations, citing Trump's calls to rename the Gulf of Mexico and acquire Greenland as examples of behavior unbefitting a president. He condemned Trump's suggestion that Ukraine cede Crimea to Russia as "modern day appeasement" and voiced worries about Europe losing confidence in America's leadership. The former president also defended his decision to exit the 2024 race, asserting it wouldn't have changed the outcome and that Kamala Harris was a strong candidate.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short of projections, leading to a stock dip. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, while net income rose to $1.78 billion, a significant increase from the previous year's loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed optimism about future growth, projecting gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the current quarter. The company is facing an FTC lawsuit over its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi disputes, and is also pushing into autonomous vehicle technology, viewing it as a major opportunity. Uber's largest business segments, mobility and delivery, saw bookings increase year over year.</p>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of brands sending Mother's Day opt-out emails, examining the motivations and implications behind this marketing strategy. These emails, often using empathetic language, allow customers to avoid Mother's Day-related promotions, suggesting the brand views them as individuals, not just consumers. The author notes that these opt-outs are good business because email is a profitable marketing channel, and they may keep people from unsubscribing. The article concludes that while well-intentioned, the idea that people can simply opt-out of pain or regret is unrealistic, as grief and other emotions are ever-present.</p>

The raccoon was unharmed, and police confirmed that Vidal had the necessary permits to legally own the animal. The incident was captured on body camera video, with the police department humorously noting that finding a raccoon holding a meth pipe was a first for their officers.</p>

Experts say that this tactic may be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, low or limited income, or no significant assets. However, debt forgiveness may not be a smart move for seniors with assets or those who want to use credit in the future. Credit card debt forgiveness can hurt credit scores, trigger tax consequences, and potentially complicate estate planning.</p>

          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea. The F/A-18F Super Hornet was attempting to land on the aircraft carrier when a maneuver failed, causing it to go overboard. Both pilots safely ejected and sustained minor injuries. This incident follows a previous mishap where a Super Hornet was lost overboard due to a towing accident. This incident is under investigation, though it was determined it was not the result of an attack.</p>
