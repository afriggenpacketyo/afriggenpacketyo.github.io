          <p>Inflation fears in the U.S. decreased in May as President Trump eased some of his tariff proposals, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey. The survey showed a substantial dip in the one-year inflation outlook, along with decreases in the three-year and five-year horizons. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett noted that inflation is down despite tariff revenue increasing, which contradicts previous concerns about tariff-induced inflation. The survey also indicated positive movements in employment and confidence in stocks (not investment advice). The optimism score reflects the improved economic outlook.</p>
