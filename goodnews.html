          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Genius Act, a significant piece of bipartisan legislation aimed at regulating the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bill, which now heads to the President's desk, establishes a legal framework and consumer protections for these dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this will foster innovation in digital payments, making transactions faster and cheaper, while also strengthening national security. Major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are already exploring issuing their own stablecoins, anticipating the new regulatory clarity will open the market to wider adoption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, decreased to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The cooling inflation is attributed to easing food price increases, providing some relief amid concerns over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs. Despite the headline rate remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, analysts do not anticipate an interest rate hike soon. They believe the central bank is focused on underlying inflation expectations, which are still below the target threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Professional Cricketers' Association Advocates for Reduced County Championship Schedule</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) is proposing a reduction in the County Championship schedule from 14 to 12 games per season, calling it the "only reasonable option." This move is part of a broader review of England's domestic cricket structure, aimed at protecting player welfare and improving the quality of play. The PCA cites research showing that 83% of players have concerns about their physical well-being under the current demanding schedule. The association supports a conference-based model or a traditional divisional structure, as long as the number of matches is reduced to address these player concerns.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has resolved his 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving." The former USC star was arrested after being found asleep at the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed. Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation and must pay a fine and complete online courses, thus avoiding any jail time. The NFL has stated that the matter remains under review according to its substance abuse policy.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has officially debunked viral social media rumors claiming that large numbers of animals are migrating out of Yellowstone National Park. Videos circulating online, which appear to show herds of bison, bears, and elk leaving the park, are believed to be AI-generated or satirical. Wildlife experts confirm that no unusual mass migration is occurring and that such movements are typically seasonal, happening in winter, not summer. The park's volcanic activity level remains normal, dispelling another theory that a pending eruption was causing the animals to flee.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the measures due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding its future energy security and gas prices, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions, which require unanimous approval, target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including a lower oil price cap and cutting more banks from the SWIFT payment system.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noticing mild swelling in his legs. CVI is a common circulatory condition, especially in adults over 70, where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood return to the heart, causing blood to pool. Symptoms can include varicose veins, leg swelling, and discomfort, though the president's physician described his condition as "benign." Treatment is typically non-surgical and focuses on managing symptoms through compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise like walking to help muscles pump blood.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China tripled compared to the same period last year, reaching $6.7 million. This significant increase coincides with a record high for China's overall rare earth imports and a narrowing trade surplus for Brazil with China. Analysts suggest this shift reflects China's strategy to diversify its access to strategic minerals and is also a ripple effect of the ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The trend indicates that global supply chains may be rerouting through emerging economies to navigate the trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating analyst expectations with revenue of $11.08 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. The company's net income grew to $3.1 billion, and it raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy membership growth and strong ad sales. This is the second quarter the streaming giant has not released subscriber data, instead emphasizing metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the positive results, the company's stock dipped slightly in after-hours trading, likely due to a warning of lower operating margins in the second half of the year.
