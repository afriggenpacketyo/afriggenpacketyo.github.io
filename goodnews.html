          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative aims to address mounting criticism over rising rice prices, which have doubled due to a poor harvest and increased demand from inbound tourism. The government plans to release 300,000 tons of rice initially and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. While this move may provide some relief, analysts remain uncertain whether it will significantly impact overall rice prices due to limited reserves.</p>

The study, published in Global Change Biology, found that the birds' beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders. Male hummingbirds' beaks also grew pointier over time to help them compete for food at feeders. The increased availability of food has allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward, according to the article.</p>
