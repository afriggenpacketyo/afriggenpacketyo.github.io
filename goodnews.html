          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals, staffed by specialists to treat individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England believes the new units will reduce hospital overcrowding and relieve pressure on emergency services, including the police. However, some experts express skepticism, calling for thorough testing and better funding of NHS mental health services.</p>

          <p>Mexican music star Juli√≥n √Ålvarez's sold-out concert at AT&T Stadium in Arlington has been postponed due to visa issues. The promoters cited unforeseen circumstances preventing √Ålvarez from entering the U.S. in time for the event. √Ålvarez expressed disappointment and thanked fans for their support. He had previously faced visa revocation in 2017 due to alleged ties to a drug trafficker, but regained his visa in 2025.</p>

          <p>Japanese supermarkets are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to offer consumers an alternative amid rising prices. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at its stores, which is cheaper than domestic rice. Other retailers have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The move reflects consumer interest in affordable options as rice prices reach record levels.</p>
