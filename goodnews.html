          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have apologized to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020 related to the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling ordering compensation for Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and Junji Shimada, a former director. The men were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology, and the company is seeking a third-party review of the investigation.</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, explores the historical context behind the lack of resources and support for family caregivers in the United States. The film traces how caregiving evolved from a public concern to a largely private matter, highlighting key legislative decisions and societal shifts. It examines the exclusion of domestic workers from Social Security benefits, the intentional lack of long-term care coverage in Medicare, and the unintended consequences of Medicaid policies. The documentary also features activists working to craft new caregiving policies and discusses potential solutions like tax credits for family caregivers.</p>
