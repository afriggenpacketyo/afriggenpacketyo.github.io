          <p>A Kentucky woman, Holly LaFavers, was surprised to find 70,000 lollipops, costing $4,000, delivered to her home after her 8-year-old son, Liam, used her phone to place the order, with the intention of having a carnival. LaFavers initially panicked upon discovering the charge, but Amazon fully refunded the purchase and the bank waived associated fees.

          <p>The British government has secured a trade agreement with the United States, easing the impact of recent tariff increases, as announced by President Trump. This agreement aims to protect the British economy, which narrowly avoided a recession and faces challenges from global economic instability, while also bolstering consumer and business confidence. While the deal is expected to benefit sectors like the auto industry, its overall impact on the British economy may be limited, and the Bank of England has cut interest rates amid concerns about lingering price pressures. The article contextualizes the deal within broader economic challenges and policy decisions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling three federal agencies: the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The ruling sided with Democratic-led states that argued the closings violated the separation of powers, affirming that Congress makes laws and appropriates funds, while the Executive implements them. Judge McConnell stated that the states presented compelling evidence of harm already unfolding due to the dismantling of these agencies. This article outlines the legal challenge to the administration's actions and the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Casey Johnston, a writer, discovered strength through weightlifting after years of dieting and punishing running routines, transforming her relationship with her body. She found that lifting weights helped her build emotional strength, repair disordered eating, and embrace movement, rest, and eating equally. Johnston's book, 'A Physical Education,' details her journey of quitting diet culture and gaining the power of lifting, emphasizing that exercise can be about health and well-being rather than just weight loss.

          <p>Despite the prevalence of hard-line ideologues in President Trump's administration, establishment figures like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have regained influence, steering policies in their preferred direction. Bessent has taken the lead in trade negotiations, sidelining hardliners, while Rubio has assumed key foreign policy roles. The shift reflects a tug-of-war between dueling factions on economic and foreign policy, with Trump at times favoring disruption but also turning to establishment figures to clean things up.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer views the deal as a vindication of his cultivation of Trump, while experts suggest it may be a more limited agreement than traditional trade deals.

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will reduce the burden of President Trump's tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal aims to lower or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agriculture products. The agreement would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters, but it may do little to address Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits.
