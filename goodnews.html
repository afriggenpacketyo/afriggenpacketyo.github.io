          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is excelling at Napoli after leaving Manchester City on a free transfer, prompting debate over whether the club let him go prematurely. Despite a decorated career at City, the 34-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements but has since demonstrated formidable form for both his new club and the Belgian national team. His performance suggests he could still have been a key player for City, which has had a mixed start to its season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, raising questions about who retains ownership of the property. Homeowners who take out a reverse mortgage remain the legal owners and keep the title to their house; the lender only places a lien on the property to secure the loan. The loan, plus interest, becomes due when the borrower sells the home, moves out, or passes away, at which point the heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the home or sell it.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump embarked on a high-profile trip to the Middle East, framing a newly brokered Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal as a historic achievement for "everlasting peace." The visit, which included stops in Israel and Egypt, was portrayed as a victory lap for his administration's role in the intense negotiations. However, behind the celebratory tone, significant questions remain about the fragility of the truce and the challenging next steps for securing a long-term solution for governing Gaza.</p>

The company's executives are now planning to increase the 737 Max production rate from 38 to 42 per month by the end of the year, signaling growing confidence in its recovery.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion judgment against him for defaming the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones had repeatedly and falsely claimed the 2012 massacre was a hoax, leading to a Connecticut jury awarding massive damages to the families for the harassment they endured. Jones's lawyers had argued the sum was a "financial death penalty," but the high court's denial means he remains liable.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to halt the mortgage market, it could create minor delays for borrowers seeking government-backed loans. Conventional mortgages from private lenders should proceed normally, but applications for loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA may face processing slowdowns due to staff furloughs. Additionally, the shutdown could complicate closings for homes in flood zones, as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program may be unable to issue new policies.</p>

He suggested that while Australia remains the favorite at home, the gap between the two sides is closer than it has been in years.</p>
