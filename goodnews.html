          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title by defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a swift Wimbledon women's final, winning 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This marked the first time in 114 years that a Wimbledon women's final ended with one player failing to win a single game. For Swiatek, this victory adds a Wimbledon championship to her four French Open titles and one U.S. Open title, solidifying her status as a dominant force in women's tennis. The match was a career milestone for Anisimova, who was playing in her first-ever Grand Slam final after returning to the sport from a mental health break.</p>

          <p>China's space economy is experiencing a significant boom, driven by a surge in private investment and strong government support. This growth is part of a global trend where the space industry, now valued at over $630 billion, is expanding faster than the world economy. Chinese private enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace have achieved major milestones, such as launching rockets into orbit, positioning the country as a key player in the commercial space race. The China Research and Development Institute projects that private investment in the nation's aerospace industry will constitute 45% of total investment by 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is strategically focusing on developing "future industries" as part of a new growth model centered on technological innovation and industrial advancement. First conceptualized by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this initiative targets emerging sectors with high potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines to steer development in these key areas. This push aims to secure China's position in the global tech race by nurturing foundational technologies that are expected to drive significant future economic expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:25:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing is reportedly exploring the possibility of restarting production of its C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft, which was discontinued in 2015. The revival of interest is attributed to recent global conflicts highlighting the need for large, versatile cargo jets capable of landing on short, undeveloped runways. Production originally ceased due to a lack of demand and significant defense budget cuts under the 2011 Budget Control Act, which made the expensive aircraft less viable. Reviving the C-17 would be a complex undertaking, as its original Long Beach, California factory has been closed and is currently for sale. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several companies, including UK-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. These start-ups aim to offer a product that mimics the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese, addressing the quality gap often found in plant-based alternatives. Despite a recent decline in the vegan food market, these firms are targeting a "silent revolution" by first replacing cheese in products like frozen pizzas. They hope to launch commercially within a few years, aiming for a price point competitive with artisanal and eventually supermarket cheeses.</p>

          <p>The reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, with viewership for its 12th series returning to levels not seen in years.

Content creators and fans are using the platform for recaps, analysis, and discourse, making the show more accessible to viewers who cannot commit to the nightly one-hour episodes. This shift indicates that social media has become crucial for the survival and growth of modern reality television.</p>

          <p>With the cost of package holidays soaring, families are employing creative strategies to save money on their summer vacations. One family saved thousands of pounds by booking a last-minute, all-inclusive trip to Mexico just two days before departure, which was cheaper than a European holiday. Another couple saved over £3,000 by traveling off-peak and finding a "kids go free" deal for their twin daughters. Other popular money-saving hacks include home-swapping to get free accommodation, using credit card loyalty points for flights, and house-sitting to enjoy a staycation or travel affordably within another country.</p>

Though bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start set a crucial tone for the team. The performance is an encouraging sign as he continues to build up his pitching workload while contributing to the Dodgers' efforts to regain momentum.</p>
