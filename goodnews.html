        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill following a backlash from over 100 of its own Members of Parliament. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall confirmed that planned cuts to disability and sickness benefits will now only apply to future claimants, not current recipients. The government also plans to fast-track a ¬£1 billion support package. This climbdown was necessary to avoid a potential defeat in the House of Commons, with rebel MPs expressing concerns over the impact on vulnerable individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Japan prepares for a national parliamentary election in July, the government has formally requested that major social media platform operators take stronger measures to counter disinformation and defamation. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications asked nine companies, including X and Line, to clarify their processes for removing harmful content and to act on such requests swiftly. This move is supported by a joint statement from seven political parties, who agree that the spread of false information threatens fair elections but have not yet agreed on specific regulations.</p>

          <p>A German data protection authority has declared that the Chinese AI app DeepSeek unlawfully transfers user data to China and has requested that Apple and Google consider blocking it from their app stores. The Berlin data protection commissioner stated that the company failed to demonstrate that German user data would be protected from access by Chinese authorities, a violation of the EU's GDPR. This action follows similar scrutiny of DeepSeek in other European countries, including Italy and Ireland, and could potentially lead to an EU-wide ban if regulators agree.</p>

          <p>Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fern√°ndez is showing remarkable form as he prepares to face his former club, Benfica, in the Club World Cup.

This development follows high-level talks in London and aims to stabilize a relationship that had faltered after a preliminary deal was struck in Geneva.

          <p>The recent direct conflict between Israel and Iran has prompted key Middle Eastern states like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to carefully recalibrate their diplomatic positions. These nations navigated the crisis with ambiguity, publicly condemning Israeli actions while privately taking steps to protect their own security, sometimes in cooperation with the U.S. or Israel. The conflict has weakened Iran and its regional proxies, leading Gulf states to pursue a balanced approach of cautious engagement with a diminished, but still important, Iran. This reflects a broader regional strategy focused on maintaining stability and managing complex alliances.</p>
