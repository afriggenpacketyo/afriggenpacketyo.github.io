          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road connecting the Central Coast to the San Joaquin Valley. However, upon investigation, the responding officer discovered that the animal was not an exotic feline but a deceased hawk. It remains unclear what led to the caller's zoological misidentification. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without special permits.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking crowd, estimated at up to 200,000 people, participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new law restricting gatherings that promote homosexuality, which could result in heavy fines for attendees and prison sentences for organizers. The march was attended by international supporters, including EU officials and MEPs, who emphasized that the event was about fundamental rights for all citizens. Participants expressed concerns over the erosion of democratic values and the desire for a more diverse and inclusive Hungary.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outperforming the field by over half a second at the Red Bull Ring. Norris described his qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, signaling a return to form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a front suspension revision designed to improve his feel for the car. While championship leader and teammate Oscar Piastri will start third, Norris's dominant qualifying run provides a satisfying boost and a strong opportunity for the race.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is issuing a voluntary recall for more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager minivans due to a potential issue with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding sufficient pressure during deployment in certain crashes, increasing injury risk. Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the side curtain airbags for free if necessary, and owners are urged to follow recall instructions.</p>

England's response faltered early, as they lost four wickets within the first seven overs and were ultimately bowled out for 113. The decisive loss marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and highlights the challenges they face in the five-match series against a strong Indian side.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the 30th annual Budapest Pride, defying a government ban in what organizers called the largest LGBTQ+ event in Hungary's history. The march proceeded after Budapest's mayor declared it a municipal event, bypassing a recent law targeting gatherings that "promote" homosexuality. The massive turnout was seen as a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's right-wing government, which has increasingly cracked down on LGBTQ+ rights. Participants and international observers framed the event not just as a fight for equal rights but as a defense of democratic processes in Hungary.</p>

However, the win was tempered by an injury to Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring, raising concerns about squad depth in that key position. Coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking intent and the creativity of fly-half Finn Russell but noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed. The performance also highlighted the strong form of lock Joe McCarthy, who is making a case for a Test spot.</p>
