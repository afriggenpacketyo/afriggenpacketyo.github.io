          <p>Elon Musk stated he regrets some of his recent social media posts directed at U.S. President Donald Trump following a public dispute. The feud had previously led to market concerns regarding Musk's Tesla and SpaceX businesses, particularly after Musk spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump's administration. Musk acknowledged that his remarks on the X platform went too far, indicating a desire to mend the relationship. This comes after a period of tension that seemingly dissolved their tight partnership, potentially impacting Musk's business ventures and creating uncertainty in the tech sector. The tech mogul hopes to repair relations with the US president.</p>

          <p>Asia is increasingly reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging strategies.

This trend is part of a broader global move away from the dollar, driven by concerns that the dollar can be used as leverage in trade negotiations and direct sanctions. Asian economies with substantial foreign assets, such as Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China, are leading the repatriation of foreign earnings to their home currencies.
