        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia refuted claims that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. This denial follows a report suggesting Nvidia was developing a research and development center in Shanghai to cater to the local market while adhering to U.S. restrictions. According to Nvidia, no GPU designs will be modified or sent to China for compliance purposes, clarifying that production and design will remain outside of China. CEO Jensen Huang reportedly discussed the potential center with Shanghai's mayor, Gong Zheng, during a recent visit.</p>

Trump attacked Springsteen's appearance and told him to "keep his mouth shut" until returning to the U.S. Springsteen has been a long-time supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, and previously called Trump "the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime" during the 2024 election. The exchange highlights the ongoing political divide and the intersection of politics and entertainment.</p>

He said the process was "unfair, infuriating" and took nine rounds of comments with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than those of traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal hardened the company, which funded itself mostly through investment gains and trading.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, a bloody bare footprint, helped solve the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators compared the footprints to multiple people, including Arthur Gray, who was cleared due to a solid alibi. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile, which through investigative genetic genealogy, led to Jerry Westrom. Westrom was arrested in 2019 and denied knowing Childs, but his DNA and footprints linked him to the crime scene, leading to his conviction.</p>
