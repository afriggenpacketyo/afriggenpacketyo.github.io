The PKK's decision follows a call by Abdullah Ocalan, one of its founders, to disarm. This announcement is expected to reassure Turkey, which has accused the SDF of being a PKK proxy.

          <p>President Trump's changing tariffs have caused uncertainty for consumers, but a U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods. Shoppers should look for sales events like Memorial Day and Amazon Prime Day. Check the origin of products, as goods traded under the USMCA are exempt from tariffs. Shoppers should purchase domestic products when possible and consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming. Shoppers shouldn't panic shop, but should move up timelines for planned purchases.</p>

In Antioquia, families offer scientists a rare opportunity to develop targeted treatments.</p>

          <p>A $1 million annuity can provide monthly payments ranging from around $5,800 to more than $10,600, depending on factors like age, gender, and the type of annuity. The older you are when you begin collecting annuity payments, the higher your monthly income will be, due to a shorter expected payout period. Other important considerations include the annuity type, contract structure (lifetime-only vs. joint-life), and whether the annuity offers inflation protection. (not investment advice)</p>
