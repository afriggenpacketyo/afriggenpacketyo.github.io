          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, a week after suggesting he approved a merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are seeking clarity on the deal's structure, especially regarding U.S. Steel's headquarters and Nippon's investment plans. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick stated that the U.S. government would have a "golden share" allowing it to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has been reviewing the deal for national security risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite JPMorgan Chase's increasing profitability and crucial role in the U.S. economy, CEO Jamie Dimon consistently expresses a pessimistic outlook on the economy and geopolitical landscape. While Dimon's leadership has led to record profits for JPMorgan, his economic predictions have not always been accurate, causing some to question his motives. Some speculate that Dimon's cautious remarks are intended to keep his management team focused on future risks and prevent complacency. Regardless, JPMorgan continues to thrive, driven by its size, technological investments, and Dimon's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors should monitor gold prices closely this June, with potential for another price spike due to inflation data and Federal Reserve meetings. While the price is down from a recent record high, experts predict it could rise again, possibly reaching $4,000 per ounce. Gold prices typically increase over time, making it a reliable hedge against inflation and a tangible asset for portfolio diversification. Cost-effective ways to invest, such as fractional gold and dollar-cost averaging, are still available, but gold should be limited to 10% or less of the overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
