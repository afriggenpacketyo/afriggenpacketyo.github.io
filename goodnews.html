          <p>The Japanese fruit sandwich, or "furutsu sando," is making its debut on UK supermarket shelves, with Marks & Spencer launching a limited-edition strawberries and cream version. This viral sensation, popular in Japan as a snack or dessert, features fruit and whipped cream between slices of soft, sweet bread. While the combination might seem unusual to some, it follows a tradition of fruit in sandwiches, like the classic banana or jam sandwich. The article explores the cultural context of the fruit sando and discusses other unique sandwich varieties from around the world.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the writer and star of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," are preparing for a new series that delves into taboo subjects with dark humor. The show, which follows two sisters and their mother navigating financial and romantic struggles, draws inspiration from their own upbringing in an all-woman household. Sadler says the new season will be even more daring, fueled by observations of the "bleak" modern dating scene and a desire to satirize societal pressures. The series is celebrated for its unflinching take on topics like mental health and family dysfunction.</p>

The restoration project, led by a Nagoya-based company with personal ties to the city, will feature six exclusive suites with private saunas, blending original architectural elements with modern wellness design.

          <p>Japanese farmers and researchers are promoting the prickly pear cactus as a new superfood, rich in minerals and dietary fiber. In Kasugai, a city known for its ornamental cacti, farmers are now cultivating edible varieties for use in dishes from tempura to quiche. Research from Chubu University suggests the plant can enhance immune function, and the UN has highlighted its potential as a resilient food source in the face of climate change. With its mild taste and versatility, the prickly pear is being introduced to local schools and supermarkets, aiming to become a common vegetable in Japan.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are reviving a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy as a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. This method uses bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria, to treat infections. The University of Southampton's Phage Collection Project is actively searching for these beneficial viruses in everyday environments, like toilet water, and has already found phages capable of killing bacteria from persistent patient infections. As the threat of the "silent pandemic" of antimicrobial resistance grows, phage therapy offers a promising alternative to failing antibiotics.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates, whom she had known since elementary school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had reached out to her sooner. Schafer's project served as a powerful personal effort to be seen and to remind others to make an effort to connect.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has made a bullish prediction for the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a massive influx of capital is forthcoming and warning traders to pay attention. His comments align with other optimistic analysts who foresee the total crypto market capitalization potentially reaching $100 trillion within the next decade, a significant increase from its current level of around $3.26 trillion. This growth is anticipated to be driven by widespread adoption from institutions, sovereign entities, and individual investors accumulating assets like Bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a five-wicket haul from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets after initially showing promise in their pursuit of a 301-run target. Hazlewood's controlled bowling dismantled the top order, and despite some late resistance, Australia sealed the win with two days to spare.
