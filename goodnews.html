          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:19:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $118,000, driven by significant inflows into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest daily inflow of the year at $1.18 billion, fueling a rally that also saw Ether climb back above the $3,000 mark. The upward trend, which began after the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes, was intensified by a wave of short liquidations totaling over $650 million. Analysts suggest that expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and upcoming crypto-friendly legislation are contributing to the positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabin offerings, similar to how it unbundled its main cabin with basic economy fares. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to provide more choices for customers with different needs, as premium seat revenue continues to grow. While specific changes were not detailed, possibilities could include cheaper business-class tickets without lounge access or more luxurious suites with additional amenities. This move reflects an industry trend where airlines are focusing on maximizing revenue from front-of-plane seating, where demand has remained strong compared to economy.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Treasury Reports Unexpected Budget Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:54:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a surprising budget surplus of $27 billion in June, largely due to a significant surge in customs duties from tariffs. This monthly surplus contrasts with the fiscal year's overall deficit, which stands at $1.34 trillion. Tariff collections for the month were $27 billion, a 301% increase from the previous year, following President Trump's implementation of widespread import tariffs. Despite the monthly surplus, the government's finances remain challenged by high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled $84 billion in June alone and are projected to reach $1.2 trillion for the full fiscal year.

          <p>Chemical manufacturer DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning the contamination of the water supply in Hoosick Falls, New York. This brings the total amount recovered for residents to over $90 million, following earlier settlements with three other companies. The lawsuit, filed in 2016, claimed that a local facility contaminated drinking water with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a harmful "forever chemical" used in Teflon production. The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, also includes $6 million to fund an existing medical monitoring program for residents exposed to the carcinogen.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner secured his place in the Wimbledon men's final with a decisive straight-sets victory over seven-time champion Novak Djokovic, winning 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. The 23-year-old Italian's dominant performance ended Djokovic's latest attempt to win a record 25th Grand Slam title. Sinner will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated final, a rematch of their recent five-set classic at the French Open. Sinner's victory marks his first Grand Slam final appearance on grass and continues a trend where at least one of the two young stars has competed in the last six major finals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:24:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With recent news suggesting Social Security could face insolvency a year earlier than predicted, many seniors are seeking ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines several financial strategies for homeowners and those with savings. Options include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 or older to receive monthly payments from their home equity. Another possibility is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum payment. While less ideal due to interest costs, personal loans are also presented as a way to create an emergency fund to bridge any financial gaps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle cast into the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland, Canada, 13 years ago has washed ashore on a beach in Ireland, over 2,000 miles away. The note was written in 2012 by Brad and Anita Squires, who were dating at the time. It was discovered this week by a couple in the Maharees Peninsula, who shared the find with a local conservation group. The group's social media post went viral, and within an hour, the Squires, now married with three children, were located. The heartwarming story has connected the couple with new friends across the ocean.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' serves as a portrait of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of deep romantic connections. Despite high viewership, the season has been criticized for featuring more "situationships" than genuine romance. The author suggests this reflects a generation that grew up online, has less real-world relationship experience, and is anxious about vulnerability. Contestants who do show strong emotions have become fan favorites, possibly because viewers relate to the struggle of putting oneself out there in a culture that often values being chill.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a new program to provide direct cash assistance to individuals and families impacted by the Trump administration's recent immigration raids. The aid, funded by philanthropic partners rather than city money, will be distributed via cash cards worth a "couple hundred" dollars through immigrant rights groups. The initiative aims to help those who are afraid to leave their homes or have lost income due to a family member's detention. The announcement is part of a broader city response that includes reinforcing sanctuary city policies and seeking records from ICE on the recent enforcement actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the popular 10,000-steps-a-day fitness goal, revealing it began as a marketing campaign for a Japanese pedometer in the 1960s, not as a scientifically derived health metric. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research suggests it is a reasonable benchmark for physical activity. Studies show health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts like 2,500 per day, with benefits often plateauing around 7,500 steps. Experts emphasize that while 10,000 steps is a good target, the most important thing is to increase daily movement, as any activity is better than none.</p>

          <p>A pilot program in 15 regions across England will allow GP surgeries to offer patients support services to help them return to work more quickly. With £1.5 million in funding, practices can hire career coaches or occupational therapists to provide advice, refer patients to exercise classes, or help with job-seeking skills. The initiative aims to reduce the number of people signed off as "not fit for work" and is part of a broader government effort to decrease the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions. The Royal College of GPs supports the health benefits of work but cautions against punitive measures for patients or doctors.</p>
