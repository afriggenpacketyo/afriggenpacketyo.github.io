        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of construction to reinforce tracks threatened by landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, which includes placing boulders and sand along the rail line to stabilize the area. The Orange County Transportation Authority acknowledged recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs. The total cost of the projects is estimated at $300 million, and work will continue daily until the rail line reopens.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition after undergoing brain surgery following his IBF minimumweight title match. Shigeoka suffered a subdural hematoma after losing a split decision to Pedro Taduran. He was not knocked down during the bout but lost consciousness after the final bell and was rushed to the hospital. Due to Japan Boxing Commission rules, Shigeoka will likely have to retire from the sport, as boxers who have had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license.</p>

Costco's consistent sales growth and margin improvement demonstrate its strength as a retailer focused on value, and while the stock is up year to date, analysts are waiting for a pullback before buying more.

          <p>Global investors are increasingly considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China as a means of portfolio diversification and defense against geopolitical tensions, according to Cambridge Associates. Despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, and Chinese and Hong Kong stocks are attractive due to their valuations. With compelling valuations and falling interest rates in the region, diversifying away from US equities is becoming more appealing. The sentiment follows Washington and Beijing's agreement to reduce most tariffs, easing geopolitical risk.</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions.
