          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. The blockade was due to concerns over a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028, but Slovakia has now received guarantees regarding its future gas prices and supply security. The new sanctions, which require unanimous approval from all 27 member states, target Russia's energy and banking sectors. This includes a prohibition on using the Nordstream pipelines and a reduction in the oil price cap.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common circulatory condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. According to his physician, the condition is considered benign and affects the veins' ability to return blood from the legs to the heart, sometimes causing swelling or varicose veins. The White House press secretary stated the president remains in "excellent health," and treatment for CVI typically involves non-surgical methods like compression stockings and exercise. The diagnosis helps explain recent public speculation about the president's health.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers rookie center Yanic Konan Niederhauser is showing significant potential during the NBA Summer League, impressing with his diverse skills. The 6-foot-11 player, selected with the 30th pick in the draft, has displayed strong defense, rebounding, and unexpected agility, including a notable coast-to-coast dunk. Originally a guard in his native Switzerland before a major growth spurt, Niederhauser is now focused on developing his game as a center with guidance from veteran teammates. The Clippers organization sees considerable upside in the 22-year-old, viewing him as a key developmental prospect for the team's future.</p>

          <p>The city of Long Beach is exploring the possibility of bringing professional baseball back by considering an agreement for a new team to play at Blair Field. The proposal involves an ownership group that includes a co-founder of the successful independent Oakland Ballers, with the new team set to join the Pioneer League next season. This would mark the fourth attempt to establish a minor league team in the city in the last three decades. Proponents believe the city's strong baseball tradition and the stability of the Pioneer League create a promising environment for the venture's success.</p>

          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is set to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he spent the first 11 years of his career. Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract that includes a no-trade clause and a player option for the 2027-28 season. The move comes after he was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks, where he played for one season.

          <p>Analysts predict that the fentanyl crisis will be a significant issue on the agenda for upcoming U.S.-China trade talks, marking its return to high-level discussions after a long absence. The powerful synthetic opioid has become a leading cause of death for young adults in the United States, elevating it to a national security concern. Experts believe that addressing the flow of fentanyl precursors from China could serve as a potential area for cooperation, possibly easing broader economic tensions between the two nations. The inclusion of this public health issue could reshape the dynamics of the ongoing trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that she made a costly deal with Disney to use a sample from the 1970 film "The Aristocats" in her recent song, "Heterocomía." While she doesn't expect to see much financial return from the track, she stated the catharsis was worth the price. The song, which features lyrics widely speculated to be about her past relationship with a billionaire heir, uses the whimsical intro to contrast with a darker story of deception. The track and its accompanying TikTok video have gone viral, with fans connecting the song's title and lyrics to her ex-partner's distinct eye condition.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue to $11.08 billion. The company also raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy membership growth, advertising sales, and favorable currency exchange rates. This marks the second quarter that Netflix has not released specific subscriber numbers, instead focusing on financial metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the positive results, the company warned of lower margins in the second half of the year due to higher costs, causing a slight dip in its stock price in after-hours trading.

The legislation defines what can be marketed as a stablecoin and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto has emerged as a dependable All-Star, a transformation he credits to his high-pressure experiences during last season's playoffs.

That game became a major source of confidence, propelling him into a dominant second season where he has become a cornerstone of the team's rotation.
