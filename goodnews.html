          <h2>German Conservative Leader Faces Second Vote After Initial Chancellor Bid Fails</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:16:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, unexpectedly failed to secure a majority in the initial parliamentary vote for chancellor, marking an unprecedented event in modern German politics. Despite his coalition holding enough seats, 18 members of parliament who were expected to support him dissented, leading to a second vote scheduled for later that day. Political commentators viewed Merz's defeat as a significant humiliation, with the far-right party calling for fresh elections. The article notes that Germany's government handover is carefully choreographed, and Merz's failure undermines his hopes of providing stability after the previous government's collapse.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at easing exports for UK firms, including whisky and cars, to India, while reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. The British government emphasized that the deal does not include changes to immigration policy, including for Indian students in the UK. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds highlighted the 'massive' benefits for UK businesses and consumers. The government projects the deal will boost trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040, building on the existing ¬£41 billion in trade between the two nations last year.</p>

          <p>As Warren Buffett announces his retirement, the article reflects on his investment strategy, which involves viewing potential investments as a 'castle' with a protective 'moat.' Buffett assesses a business's intrinsic value by examining factors like consistent earnings, cash flow, and debt levels, aiming to determine its resilience against competition. He favors businesses that are fundamentally sound and can be run even by a 'fool,' emphasizing the importance of consistent cash flows and a dominant market position. Buffett's approach involves long-term investments and sound business models, exemplified by his investment in undervalued Japanese companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has been advocating for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, arguing that inflation has cooled and high borrowing costs are unnecessary. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting, taking a 'wait-and-see' approach to assess the impact of Trump's economic policies, including tariffs. Economists predict potential rate cuts later in the year, possibly starting in July, to provide relief on borrowing costs. However, some economists believe the Fed may delay cutting rates until December, depending on labor market conditions and tariff-induced inflation.</p>

          <p>China has released an action plan to decrease the amount of grain used in animal feed, particularly soybean meal, to enhance food security amid global trade uncertainties. The goal is to reduce the proportion of grain in animal feed to 60% and soybean meal to 10% by 2030. This initiative is part of a broader campaign to safeguard domestic crop supplies and minimize grain losses, including warnings against food waste. The move is driven by increasing meat demand and concerns about the reliability of grain supplies for livestock.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above target, prices for some consumer goods like airfare, produce, household items, electronics, and gasoline have recently declined in the U.S. Experts attribute these price drops to various factors, including supply and demand dynamics, seasonal effects, and lower transportation costs. However, economists caution that these lower prices may not last due to potential reversals in volatile categories and the impact of tariffs.
