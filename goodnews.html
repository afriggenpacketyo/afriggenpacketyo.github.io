          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, announced their departure to form a new law firm. This follows criticism of Paul Weiss's chairman, Brad Karp, for making a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting the firm's business. The deal, which limited Paul Weiss lawyers' ability to enter courthouses, sparked controversy and led to similar deals by other firms. Dunn had been supportive of the decision to strike a deal with Mr. Trump and was part of the firm's leadership team that worked with Mr. Karp in getting other partners‚Äô support. The departing partners did not directly address the Trump deal in their farewell email.</p>

          <p>Following a gala for top investors in President Trump's cryptocurrency meme coin, some attendees were invited to tour the White House, raising concerns about potential "pay for play." Critics argue that investors who poured millions into Trump's crypto coin gained special access to the president. The White House maintained that the gala was a personal event, separate from official duties. Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto mogul and the top investor in Trump‚Äôs meme coin, posted a highly produced video of his White House tour, writing on X, ‚ÄúWas an honor to be invited to tour the @WhiteHouse.

          <p>The White House is undergoing a restructuring of the National Security Council, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also serving as national security adviser. The NSC staff is being reduced by at least half, with some officials reassigned and others placed on administrative leave. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser, Andy Baker, will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. Some of the reassignments don't take place until next week, one source said. One former member of the National Security Council said, "It's terrible. Less people means less control of the bureaucracy. The key is getting people who are loyal not less people,"</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to human influence, particularly backyard feeders, resulting in changes to their beak size and shape. The beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to access more nectar from feeders, and male beaks have grown pointier for fighting off rivals. This adaptation has also contributed to the expansion of the hummingbird's range northward. The study compared museum specimens from the 1800s to modern birds, highlighting the rapid pace of evolution.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey gubernatorial elections are set for this year, with hotly contested primaries next month, and experts say the race could be a bellwether for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's critical midterm elections. The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue. Republicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red -- and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants in the United States. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months. Another urges the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The Trump administration also set a goal of quadrupling the size of the nation‚Äôs fleet of nuclear power plants by 2050.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in the Arctic as China, Russia, the US, and Europe compete for resources and influence. Melting ice opens new opportunities for accessing natural resources and trade routes. China's attempts to buy into European Arctic seaports and airports have been rebuffed, pushing it towards closer cooperation with Russia. Russia controls half the Arctic shoreline and relies on its Arctic for strategic weapons, particularly on the Kola peninsula.</p>

          <p>A federal judge halted the Trump administration's attempt to block international students from attending Harvard University. Harvard sued the administration, accusing it of a "campaign of retribution" for the university's exercise of its First Amendment rights. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with demands for information on student visa holders. Harvard enrolls about 6,800 international students, or about 27 percent of its student body.</p>
