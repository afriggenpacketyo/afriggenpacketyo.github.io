          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to leave the NFL and return to rugby union, ending his 18-month pursuit of an American football career. The 24-year-old, who had been on the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad and active roster, stated it was the right time to come home and focus on what he does best. Before his departure in January 2024, Rees-Zammit had earned 32 caps for Wales. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for the Welsh national team under its new head coach, Steve Tandy.</p>

          <p>Nintendo reported that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which was released on June 5, helping push quarterly revenue to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), far exceeding market expectations. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has kept its full-year financial forecast unchanged, projecting 15 million Switch 2 sales for the fiscal year. Analysts view this target as conservative, even with potential impacts from U.S. tariffs on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, Germany has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the Atlantic region, which includes areas along the North Sea coast. Officials documented 209 wolf packs and approximately 1,600 individual animals, noting significant positive population growth in recent years. This new designation could pave the way for controlled hunting in these areas to manage the population, a move supported by farmers concerned about livestock protection. The conservation status for the rest of the country remains under review, pending further assessment by federal and state governments.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant change to its main civil service internship program, restricting eligibility exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This reform, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation in Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, the primary entry route into the civil service. The move is part of a broader government effort to diversify its workforce and make better-informed decisions by harnessing a wider range of talent and perspectives.</p>

          <p>British 800-meter runner Max Burgin, 23, is showing a return to the form that made him a record-breaking junior athlete after years of injuries and setbacks. He recently ran a personal best of 1:42.36, making him the third-fastest British man in history and a strong contender for the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo. After missing previous major competitions due to health issues, Burgin feels he is finally back on the right trajectory and is aiming for a podium finish. To qualify, he must first secure a top-two spot at this weekend's highly competitive UK Athletics Championships.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened its first permanent attaché office in Wellington, New Zealand, completing its stand-alone presence across all "Five Eyes" intelligence-sharing alliance nations. Previously, FBI operations in the country were managed from Australia. FBI Director Kash Patel, who attended the opening, stated the move demonstrates the agency's commitment to prioritizing its presence in the allied countries. The announcement drew a response from the Chinese embassy in Wellington, which opposed what it termed "groundless assertions" that China poses a threat to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A new law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect in the UK, outlawing the sale, possession, and importation of ninja swords. The legislation is the result of a multi-year campaign by Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, after her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity by two teenagers using a sword bought online. The law, which also requires retailers to report suspicious knife orders and perform age verification, is part of a broader government effort to combat knife crime. A month-long surrender scheme preceding the ban saw over 1,000 such weapons removed from the streets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, the Rhisotope Project, is embedding small amounts of radioactive material into rhinoceros horns to make them easier to detect and deter traffickers. Led by the University of the Witwatersrand, the project injects isotopes that are harmless to the rhinos but can be identified by radiation detectors at borders and airports. Researchers confirmed the process is safe for the animals and effective at triggering alarms, even when horns are hidden in large shipping containers. The effort aims to protect South Africa's rhino population, which has been devastated by poaching for the black market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The landscape of space exploration is increasingly shifting its long-term focus from the Moon to Mars, with lunar missions now often framed as preparatory steps for future red planet colonization. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance human presence on the Moon, rhetoric from both national agencies and private leaders like Elon Musk emphasizes Mars as the ultimate goal. This modern space race involves more players than the original, with China and the European Space Agency also setting ambitious timelines for Mars missions. The trend suggests that as national agencies pivot toward Mars, lunar projects may increasingly become the domain of private space companies. (not investment advice)</p>

According to Kuwait's deputy minister of defence, the project, which will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, is a "milestone" in their cooperation. The announcement was made at a Chinese embassy event celebrating the founding of the People's Liberation Army. This development signifies Beijing's growing influence and engagement in the Middle East, strengthening ties with Kuwait, which was the first Gulf nation to sign a military cooperation agreement with China in 1995.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, some of whom have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for decades. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the terminations were "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus." The administration has sought to curtail TPS programs, arguing conditions in the home countries have improved.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's process for handling the increasing number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents use more executive orders to bypass a gridlocked Congress, more legal challenges inevitably reach the high court for emergency intervention. He acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its process, including by writing more and scheduling oral arguments. He emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices, even amid strong disagreements on difficult issues.</p>
