This market optimism follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indication that the central bank might ease monetary policy next month. Chinese property stocks also saw significant gains after Shanghai relaxed home-buying restrictions, contributing to the broader market momentum. Analysts suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining the positive trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, driven by falling retail, electricity, and gas prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain moderate, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price hikes. The central bank has already adjusted monetary policy twice this year to address weaker growth, as the trade-dependent economy faces a "downshift" in the global trade environment.
