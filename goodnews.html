          <p>Financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region rose, following gains on Wall Street as investors anticipate China's decision on its loan prime rates. The rates are widely expected to remain unchanged after the central bank recently held a key interest rate steady. This positive market movement, with gains in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, reflects investor sentiment following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. The article reports on standard market fluctuations and expectations for stability in China's lending policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move aimed at reviving the two-state solution. The coordinated announcement was made to build international momentum for peace, despite strong opposition from Israel and the United States. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the decision, calling it a "reward to terror" and vowing that a Palestinian state would not be established. The recognition is largely symbolic but marks a historic shift, particularly for the U.K., given its historical role in the region.</p>

          <p>A child development specialist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships outlines nine key behaviors that help cultivate exceptional social skills in children from an early age. The approach emphasizes modeling emotional regulation, empathy, and authentic confidence rather than simply teaching polite phrases. Key practices include openly discussing feelings, validating a child's emotions, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. The article suggests that creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection at home provides the foundation for children to build strong, healthy relationships outside of it.</p>

          <p>The UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, Pat McFadden, has affirmed the government's commitment to reforming the welfare system to better support individuals in returning to work and to manage rising benefit costs. The statement comes after the government recently abandoned a controversial policy aimed at cutting disability benefits. The new approach will involve offering skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to seek employment. McFadden stated that the current system creates an "unhealthy" binary between being fit or unfit for work and needs significant changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists at MIT is pioneering a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild mice. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," aims to make the white-footed mouse—the primary carrier of the Lyme bacteria—immune to the disease. By introducing Lyme-resistant mice into the ecosystem on islands like Nantucket, they hope to break the infection cycle where ticks feed on infected mice and then transmit the illness to humans. This innovative use of CRISPR technology represents a significant step in "sculpting evolution" to address a public health crisis, pending community and regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, offering a curriculum centered on the "fearless pursuit of truth" and open debate. Founded in response to what its creators see as a stifling of free expression on traditional college campuses, UATX promotes intellectual diversity and civil discourse. The university, which currently offers free tuition funded by private donors, features small, seminar-style classes based on Western civilization and emphasizes critical thinking over political conformity. It aims to be a disrupter in higher education by creating a space where differing views are welcomed and challenged.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies is undertaking its remarkable annual migration from Canada and the U.S. to a specific mountain forest in Mexico. This special generation can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, allowing them to complete the 3,000-mile journey. Scientists are still studying the mysteries of their navigation and instinct, which guide multiple generations to the same remote location. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years, prompting conservation efforts like planting milkweed to support their life cycle and ensure this natural wonder continues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell, will likely be part of the investment group seeking to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump described the potential investors as "American patriots" and stated that progress is being made on a deal with China. The sale is mandated by a U.S. law passed over concerns about the Chinese parent company ByteDance's access to American user data. A successful deal would place one of the most popular social media apps under the control of influential American media and tech figures.</p>

He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes.</p>

He noted that North Korea is producing numerous new nuclear weapons annually and that halting this progress would be a clear benefit.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of human-wildlife encounters, which are becoming more common as natural habitats shrink.

Mayor Karen Bass stated that antisemitism is unacceptable and that the city is taking action to protect Jewish Angelenos.

The result leaves both teams trailing league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the table.
