          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, but an MRI revealed a second tumor on her spine. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a plan to remove both tumors. The first tumor was removed through traditional neurosurgery, but the second required a novel approach through Flores' eye socket. After weeks of preparation and practice on cadavers, Labib and his team successfully removed the spinal tumor, and Flores is now cancer-free and undergoing rehabilitation. </p>

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations this year due to economic uncertainties, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are scaling back their spending plans after President Donald Trump announced tariffs and the stock market dropped. The average summer travel budget initially grew by 21% year-over-year but later decreased to a 13% increase. Travelers are cutting back on in-destination spending, staying with family and friends, and driving instead of flying to save money. </p>

The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where it is now on display. The center's director noted that gold lobsters are often confused with more common orange lobsters and emphasized the large number of lobsters caught, given he has encountered about 10 gold lobsters in his career. </p>

De Ligt, who is Dutch, appreciates Amorim's directness due to the Dutch reputation for blunt speaking.

          <p>The debate over women in combat roles persists as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mandates gender-neutral fitness standards for all combat jobs. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer, shared her experience attending Ranger School, emphasizing that she met the same standards as men. Hegseth's insistence that standards were lowered for women in combat roles is challenged, with Vanasse arguing that lethality extends beyond physical fitness. She believes Secretary Hegseth's message discounts the accomplishments of women in combat and is based on assumptions about their abilities. </p>

          <p>A survey of victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires reveals that most would like to return to their old neighborhoods, but they're worried about the pace of government action. Homeowners express concerns about the lack of leadership and the lengthy building permit process. They are also worried about the rebuilding process taking too long and their communities never being the same. The Project Recovery report outlines a plan to rebuild homes within three years, requiring close cooperation between builders and public officials. </p>

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2 billion upgrade. The project, designed to boost prosperity and cut journey times, involved significant overspends, delays, and closures. Welsh ministers claim the upgrade will benefit the region, while opponents criticize the cost and duration. The upgrade includes 70 structures, 40 new bridges, and 285,000 trees planted to mitigate environmental impact. </p>
