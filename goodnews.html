          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to resolve their long-standing border disputes. The meeting, Modi's first visit to China since deadly border clashes in 2020, took place ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Xi emphasized that the border issue should not define the entire relationship, urging a focus on mutual economic development and partnership. Both leaders expressed a desire for a stable and healthy bilateral relationship, with discussions on resuming direct flights and border talks having occurred in preceding weeks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity for matcha has led to significant supply shortages and price increases, even in its native Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom, demand has outstripped the capacity of Japan's aging farming communities. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used for matcha, has skyrocketed, forcing retailers to ration supplies and producers to struggle with production bottlenecks. Companies like Ito En are creating dedicated matcha divisions to manage the intense competition for sourcing and milling the green tea powder.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her from a young age. Before founding the successful AI data-labeling company Scale AI, Guo engaged in various money-making schemes, from trading Pokémon cards on the playground to selling virtual items online. She dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a decision that initially disappointed her immigrant parents but ultimately led to her immense success. Guo is now the founder of the monetization platform Passes and a venture capital firm, though her ventures have faced some legal scrutiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education reveal a strong link between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and long-term truancy. According to the data, 57% of pupils who were absent during the first week in September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to prioritize attendance at the start of the new term to combat this trend, which has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. While attendance has improved from its post-pandemic peak, it remains a significant concern for educators.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as crucial for her mental and physical well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give 100%. The 32-year-old, who captained England to the World Cup final, prioritized her health by undergoing knee surgery and starting counseling. She stated that as a leader, she had given all she could to her team and had nothing left for herself, but now feels rejuvenated for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a Trump appointee who served as the political head of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has stepped down after four months, stating his "mission accomplished." His role was to reposition the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool focused on countering Chinese influence and generating returns for the United States. Created in 2004, the MCC provides infrastructure and energy compacts to developing nations, and under the Trump administration, its focus has shifted from traditional aid to strategic investments in areas like critical minerals. Dasgupta emphasized that he worked to reform the agency into a vital national security and foreign policy asset.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim secured a much-needed 3-2 victory against Burnley, thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes. Despite the vital win, the match highlighted persistent and urgent issues with the team's goalkeepers, who have made critical errors in recent games. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers, stating that any mistake becomes major news, but conceded that the team is in a moment where any possession near their box feels like a scoring threat. The victory provides temporary relief but underscores the significant improvements needed, particularly in defense, as the team prepares for tougher upcoming fixtures.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones to haze gray wolves and prevent them from attacking livestock near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast a variety of sounds, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from the film "Marriage Story," and live human voices, to scare the predators away. This creative, non-lethal method is part of an effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist, as conflicts have increased with the species' return from near-extinction. While the technology is expensive and has limitations, early results show success in interrupting wolf hunts.</p>

The demonstrations are a response to what organizers describe as efforts by billionaires to slash healthcare, scapegoat immigrants, and divide working people for profit. The protests also highlight the challenges unions face in protecting members from the Trump Administration's policies, including immigration raids and a weakened National Labor Relations Board. Multiple demonstrations are scheduled in locations such as Wilmington, Culver City, Elysian Park, and Torrance, continuing the tradition of activism on the federal holiday.</p>

          <p>Recent steep US tariffs on Indian goods, imposed in response to India's purchase of Russian oil, are creating a new incentive for India and China to reset their strained relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit is seen as a potential turning point. The economic fallout from their 2020 border clash, which halted direct flights and Chinese investments, could see a reversal as both economic powerhouses seek to diversify trade and strengthen regional ties. This shift highlights a strategic realignment, with Delhi leveraging the SCO and other alliances to navigate a complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a major upset at the US Open by defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set thriller. After dropping the first set, the 25th seed mounted a strong comeback to win 4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-4, marking his first Grand Slam victory over a top-five opponent. The hard-fought match, lasting nearly four hours, saw Auger-Aliassime regain his form and belief after several seasons hampered by injuries and inconsistent play. For Zverev, the 2020 runner-up, the loss marks his earliest exit from the tournament in seven years and a disappointing end to his summer hard-court season.</p>

Sun highlights Tron's speed, processing transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long settlement times, as a key advantage. His confidence is rooted in the growing adoption of the Tron network for stablecoin transfers, which offer a cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

The defense also showed significant improvement from last season, recording five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the performance was dominant, it came against a much weaker Football Championship Subdivision opponent, making it a smooth start but an imperfect measure of the team's true capabilities.</p>
