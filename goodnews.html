          <p>Two West Virginia anglers, Jason Floyd and John Plott, broke separate state fishing records on the same day, April 22. Floyd caught a 24.57-inch, 5.75-pound redhorse sucker at the Belleville Lock and Dam on the Ohio River, using a swimbait and jighead. Later that day, Plott caught a 12.44-inch, 1.60-pound redear sunfish at Plum Orchard Lake in Fayette County, using a nightcrawler. This marks Plott's second record-breaking catch of the species, though his previous weight record still stands, and is the first time the redhorse sucker state record has been broken since the agency added the fish to its record categories in 2024.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) is challenging the amended Employment Equity Act in court, arguing that it is unconstitutional and economically harmful. The act imposes strict hiring targets for non-white employees, requiring companies with over 50 employees to meet sectoral targets for the number of Black people, women, and disabled people in skilled and senior roles. While supporters see it as essential for transformation, the DA argues that the act violates anti-discrimination clauses and gives the state too much regulatory power. The Pretoria High Court has reserved judgment after hearing the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to revive a controversial "most favored nation" policy aimed at slashing drug costs by tying the amount the government pays for some medicines to lower prices abroad. The executive order directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to crack down on unreasonable policies in foreign countries that suppress drug prices. It also directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage most favored nation prices, potentially cutting drug prices by 59%. The pharmaceutical industry is already bracing for planned tariffs on prescription drugs, arguing that the policy would hurt their profits and research capabilities.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China signifies progress in the U.S.'s strategic decoupling from reliance on Chinese products. Bessent emphasized that the U.S. seeks decoupling for strategic necessities, such as critical medicines and semiconductors, which were highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. While a generalized decoupling from China is not the goal, the agreement represents a 90-day pause with reciprocal duties halted, though a 10% tariff and a 20% charge related to fentanyl will remain. Bessent also expressed optimism regarding China's assistance in stopping the flow of precursor drugs related to fentanyl.</p>
