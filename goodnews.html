The ratio of children to the overall population has also fallen to 11.1%, the lowest since 1950.

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long battle for justice after the murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly influenced victims' rights in California. According to the article, after Catina was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Steven Burns, the Salarno family fought tirelessly to keep him behind bars, attending numerous parole hearings. Their advocacy led to changes in California law, allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing, enabling parents to attend trials, and requiring children to have support persons when testifying. The family's commitment to victims' rights has transformed their personal tragedy into a legacy of change and support for others. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the controversy surrounding baby food pouches and the pressure on mothers to avoid ultra-processed foods. The author, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, argues that the focus on pouches contributes to a culture of maternal guilt, where mothers are judged for choosing convenience over homemade meals. She emphasizes that the debate often overlooks the social, political, and economic factors that influence food choices, such as time constraints and the pressure to conform to intensive mothering standards. Cosslett advocates for a more supportive society that facilitates good food choices for parents and children, rather than simply condemning convenience foods. </p>
