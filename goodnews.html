          <p>After Chris Smith was shot on a first date in Farmersville, Illinois, his dog Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, huddled with him and provided warmth during the 12 hours before he was rescued. Smith was found with a gunshot wound to the head, while his date, Leslie Reeves, was dead at the scene. Smith, who doesn't remember the shooting, was told by EMTs that Tiki likely helped him survive the cold temperatures in the house caused by a broken door. Smith has since recovered, returned to singing in his band, and started a motivational speaking business.</p>

The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, aiming to bring home those who fled the genocide.</p>
