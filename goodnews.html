          <p>Overcapacity in China is leading to a surge of cheap exports, causing concern among Asian economies but potentially easing global inflation. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts due to weak domestic demand, benefiting consumers in markets like Australia with limited manufacturing. Economists suggest this influx of low-cost goods could provide relief to central banks, allowing them to balance inflation control with economic growth. Nomura predicts potential rate cuts across Asia as central banks decouple from the Federal Reserve due to subdued inflation and emerging growth risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and concerns over economic growth. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited a challenging global environment and heightened uncertainty as factors influencing the decision. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it revised its inflation outlook to 3.7%, indicating potential undershooting of the target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact, finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report indicates that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The study also found that wages of workers with AI skills are significantly higher, and employer demand for formal degrees is declining in AI-exposed jobs, creating broader opportunities. The report suggests AI can enrich automatable jobs, making them more complex and creative.</p>
