          <p>The Rodon Group, a plastics injection molding company in Pennsylvania, is experiencing a surge in demand due to President Trump's tariffs. The company, which produces K'nex toys, has seen a nearly 50% increase in demand as consumers navigate the uncertain tariff landscape. While a U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs, uncertainty remains due to ongoing trade tensions. The Rodon Group has avoided tariff chaos by using automation to keep production stateside, but the company's CEO emphasizes the need for investment in STEM education to support domestic manufacturing.
