          <p>President Trump is anticipated to sign an executive order that will ease U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move that follows the collapse of the Assad regime and the formation of a new transitional government. The new Syrian leadership has been actively seeking sanctions relief to help pay civil service salaries and rebuild the nation's war-torn infrastructure and healthcare system. This policy shift is supported by regional U.S. allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who see an opportunity to foster stability and encourage new investment in the country.</p>

          <p>Effective July 1, the minimum wage is set to rise in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. These increases, driven by ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments, will benefit more than 800,000 workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The pay hikes provide relief for low-wage workers as the federal minimum wage has remained stagnant at $7.25 per hour for the past 16 years, failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its planned digital services tax (DST) on large U.S. technology companies. The reversal came just before the first payments were due and followed President Trump's threat to halt trade deal negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack." The 3% tax on Canadian revenue was a significant point of friction in U.S.-Canada relations, and its removal is intended to allow trade talks between the two countries to resume, de-escalating a potentially damaging trade dispute.</p>
