          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home HPV screening test for cervical cancer, offering a potential alternative to traditional Pap smears. The Teal Wand, a self-collection device, allows women to mail in samples for lab analysis to detect HPV, which causes almost all cervical cancer cases. A clinical trial showed the Teal Wand has a 96% accuracy rate in detecting cervical precancers, with most participants preferring at-home self-collection. The article highlights that the test will be available for women aged 25-65 at average risk of cervical cancer, starting in California in June, with plans to expand nationally.</p>
