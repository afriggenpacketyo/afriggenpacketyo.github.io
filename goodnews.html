          <h2>Agatha Christie's Likeness Revived for Writing Course Using AI</h2>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the renowned mystery novelist who passed away in 1976, has been digitally resurrected to teach an online writing course through BBC Maestro, employing artificial intelligence to create her likeness. The course utilizes a script crafted from her writings and archival interviews, with AI generating a "digital prosthetic" overlaid on a real actor's performance. While Christie's family supports the project, emphasizing that it uses her own words, ethicists raise concerns about posthumous representation and the potential for blurring the lines between fact and fiction, especially in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>President Trump is anticipated to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a significant win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation, though details remain unclear. The agreement, teased by Trump on social media, would be the first since the imposition of stiff tariffs on America‚Äôs trading partners, which were later paused to facilitate trade negotiations. Discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as removing British taxes on U.S. technology companies, though it remains uncertain if the agreement has been finalized.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast for the successor to its successful Switch device. While the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results showed a decline in revenue and profit, largely expected as fans await the new console, investors remain focused on the Switch 2's performance. The launch of the Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., has been met with anticipation, although pre-orders were delayed due to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured.</p>

          <p>Britain is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade agreement with the United States, potentially becoming the first country to do so after the U.S. announced "reciprocal" tariffs against various trading partners. While details remain uncertain, the agreement could provide relief for UK businesses and consumers amid ongoing trade pressures. The UK, which maintains a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher "reciprocal" tariffs but is still subject to a baseline 10% levy, with hopes for a comprehensive resolution to ease economic pressures.</p>

The collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, was unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago and was scheduled to be auctioned on May 7.</p>
