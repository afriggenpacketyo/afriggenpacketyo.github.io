        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is in a strong position to win the second Test against England, largely thanks to a remarkable batting performance from captain Shubman Gill. After scoring 269 in the first innings, Gill added another 161, allowing India to set England a near-impossible target of 608 runs. By the end of day four, England's top order had faltered, leaving them at 72-3. With a successful chase highly unlikely, England faces the difficult task of batting for a draw to maintain their series lead, a strategy at odds with their typically aggressive approach.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain the Science Behind 'Old People Smell' and How to Manage It</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:28:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon often described as "old people smell" is a real biological process, according to experts. The distinct scent is primarily caused by the compound 2-nonenal, which is produced as lipids on the skin break down with age and is not easily removed by regular washing. Other contributing factors can include medications, hormonal changes, and diet. While a sudden change in body odor could indicate a health issue, experts suggest that age-related scent can be managed through a holistic approach including an antioxidant-rich diet and proper skincare.</p>

          <p>Hamas has indicated a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating its readiness to enter negotiations to implement the framework. The plan, announced by President Trump, reportedly involves a two-month ceasefire. An Israeli delegation is expected to travel to Qatar for further talks, while Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with President Trump in Washington. Hamas is reportedly seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the truce, signaling complex negotiations ahead.</p>

          <p>According to cardiologists, cultivating consistent and healthy sleep habits is a crucial nightly practice for managing hypertension. Poor sleep can disrupt the body's regulation of stress hormones like cortisol, leading to elevated blood pressure. Experts recommend creating a cool, dark sleeping environment and engaging in calming pre-bed activities. They also advise avoiding alcohol and heavy, high-sodium meals before bed, as these can negatively impact both sleep quality and cardiovascular health. For those on medication, taking it at bedtime may improve nocturnal blood pressure control.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns reflects on the American Revolution, describing it as a messy and violent civil war, not a sanitized event. He argues that understanding the founders' flaws, such as Thomas Jefferson's ownership of enslaved people, makes their achievements more profound and accessible. Burns emphasizes that the United States is held together by the powerful ideas in its founding documents, which he believes are still deeply relevant today. He suggests that engaging with this complex history is a citizen's obligation and can provide a lifeline in a divided modern era.</p>

          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT explored the fiscal impact of taxing billionaires at the same rate as the middle class. The AI's analysis highlighted that the core issue is not income tax rates, but how the U.S. tax system favors wealth growth over wages. It detailed the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where unrealized capital gains are not taxed, allowing wealth to accumulate largely untaxed. Taxing the wealth growth of the top 25 billionaires at a 20% rate could have generated an estimated $80 billion, suggesting a nationwide policy change could yield hundreds of billions for public services.

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to "tipflation," where customers feel pressured to tip more often and in more situations, from coffee shops to self-service kiosks. This technological shift, accelerated during the pandemic, has created confusion about when and how much to tip. Experts note that while the prompts can increase tips, they can also irritate customers who feel guilted into paying more. The article explores the psychology behind tipping and suggests that the new digital norms are changing a long-standing social custom.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the mix of coconut water, juices, magnesium, and salt can lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Doctors note that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and are rarely a target for reduction outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, they caution that its stress-reducing effects are unproven and likely a placebo.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the "MingKwai" typewriter, an innovative Chinese-language machine invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered after being lost for decades. The machine is historically significant as its design, which breaks down Chinese characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese computing. Scholars are excited by the find, as the typewriter represents a pivotal moment in preserving a complex, non-alphabetic language for the digital age. The restored machine will soon be on public display at Stanford University.</p>

On Saturday, swimmers flocked to newly opened swimming spots near the Eiffel Tower, celebrating the return of a "childhood dream" for many residents.

The team studies various shark species in Washington's Willapa Bay, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet, health, and the overall condition of the marine ecosystem. By demonstrating the crucial role sharks play as apex predators, the researchers hope to garner more support for conservation efforts. They argue that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy ocean.</p>
