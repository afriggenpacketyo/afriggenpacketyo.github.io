          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling 80 shares of Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) to partially offset a new position in GE Vernova, citing an overbought market and increased margin pressure due to rising beef prices. The article notes that Texas Roadhouse shares have rallied recently due to reacceleration in comparable store sales and de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Despite the positive performance, the trust lowered its price target for TXRH to $195, leading to the decision to lighten the position and downgrade the stock to a 2 rating. The sale will result in a small gain of about 2% on stock purchased in early February 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% annually in April, slightly below expectations, marking the lowest rate since February 2021. The article notes that the CPI increase was primarily driven by housing costs, while energy costs also saw a slight increase despite lower gasoline prices. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the April data is not expected to fully reflect these effects due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has adopted a wait-and-see approach regarding the tariffs' influence on inflation and economic growth.</p>

          <p>A new book alleges that former President Joe Biden's aides considered the possibility of him needing a wheelchair if he were re-elected due to his physical decline. Concerns over Biden's agility increased after a fall at the Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in June 2023. Aides reportedly shortened walking paths, insisted on handrails, and encouraged sneaker use. The book also references concerns over Biden's mental acuity, highlighted by Special Counsel Robert Hur's report. Biden ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race, with Kamala Harris succeeding him as the nominee.</p>

          <p>Inflation eased in April, with consumer prices rising 2.3% annually, the smallest increase since February 2021. Housing costs drove much of the monthly increase, while prices for natural gas, electricity, and auto insurance also rose. Despite the muted price hikes, uncertainty remains about the outlook due to President Trump's tariffs. While the trade war has had a limited effect on retail prices so far, analysts anticipate higher tariffs may become more visible in future months, particularly in furniture costs, which rose 1.5% in April.</p>
