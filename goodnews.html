          <h2>Cruise Industry in Japan Experiences Post-Pandemic Resurgence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a significant rebound after a standstill during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased demand for cruises has led to record domestic passenger numbers and a boost to local economies that rely on tourism. Japanese shipping giants are investing in cruise ships as a means of generating stable income, particularly as their cargo businesses face challenges due to trade tariffs. New ships with luxury amenities are being launched, and alliances with companies like Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, are in development to further enhance the cruise experience.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, emphasizes the importance of global scientific collaboration, particularly in AI and biotechnology, despite geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. He notes that advancements in human biology, math, physics, and chemistry are universally applicable, regardless of the innovator's location. Diamandis expresses concern over cuts to scientific funding in the U.S., arguing that these reductions could have long-term implications for the pace of scientific discovery. He aims to foster a more optimistic view of the world through his work, counteracting the brain's natural inclination towards fear and scarcity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Students may encounter subject "cold spots" due to universities reducing course offerings, according to a new report. A review by Universities UK suggests that greater collaboration between institutions could help address cost-cutting challenges and ensure students have access to a wider range of subjects. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration where possible but enforces existing laws to protect students. Universities face financial pressures due to declining international student enrollment and rising costs, leading to course cutbacks and job losses, with the government reviewing higher education funding.</p>

Despite controversy and a Title IX investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice, Hernandez won first-place medals in high jump and triple jump, and placed second in the long jump. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to receive a medal in events where a transgender athlete qualified.

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing and returning her pardon for her role in the January 6 Capitol riot. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and that those involved were guilty. She sought assistance from her Republican senator to formally refuse the pardon, stating that she cannot live with herself knowing she was guilty and accepting a pardon. Her decision contrasts with other January 6 defendants who sought and utilized their pardons, highlighting a divergence in views regarding the events of that day.</p>

The ruling party's candidate, Kim Moon-soo, initially defended Yoon's actions, turning the election into a referendum on martial law.
