          <p>Costco announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with an 8% increase in total revenue to $86.16 billion and an 11% rise in adjusted earnings per share. The strong performance was driven by margin improvements from supply chain efficiencies and increased sales of its private-label Kirkland Signature brand, which helps mitigate tariff impacts. However, the company saw a slight dip in membership renewal rates, a trend it expects to continue due to an increase in online sign-ups from a younger demographic that renews less frequently.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant jump after President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported heavy-duty trucks. The tariff, set to begin on October 1st, is intended to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. According to a Bank of America analysis, Paccar's domestically produced trucks cost more than competitors from Mexico, and this new tariff is expected to level the playing field. The move places Paccar in a more advantageous market position within the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has suspended planned export controls on semiconductor products to South Africa, following a diplomatic disagreement over the status of Taipei's representative office in Pretoria. The curbs, which would have required prior approval for shipping 47 different chip-related products, were announced earlier in the week and set to take effect in November. The reversal came after South Africa agreed to suspend its demand for changes to the Taipei office pending further negotiations. This move indicates a temporary de-escalation as both sides seek a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing dispute.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Understanding how a financial advisor is compensated is crucial for investors, yet many are unaware of the fee structures involved. Advisors are typically paid through either commissions for selling specific products or various fee-based models, such as a percentage of assets under management (AUM), flat fees, or hourly rates. Each model presents different potential conflicts of interest and benefits; commission-based advice may be influenced by payouts, while AUM fees can be less transparent. Experts advise clients to directly ask advisors about how they are paid to ensure transparency and protect their financial returns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The terrorism charge against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, has been thrown out by a London court due to a procedural error. Ó hAnnaidh, who performs as Mo Chara, was accused of displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was unlawful because prosecutors failed to obtain the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence his advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Family Offices Favor Public Stocks for AI Investment, Goldman Sachs Poll Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite high-profile venture capital deals, the investment firms of ultra-wealthy families prefer investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities and ETFs rather than direct startup investments. A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 family offices found that 52% gain AI exposure through public markets, compared to just 25% investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies within major stock indices like the S&P 500. The trend indicates a more cautious, value-oriented approach to AI investing among the ultra-rich. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judy Blume's groundbreaking young adult novel, "Forever...," celebrates its 50th anniversary, prompting reflections on its cultural impact as a rite of passage for generations of teenagers. Published in 1975, the book was notable for its candid and realistic portrayal of teenage sexuality from a young woman's perspective, including themes of first love, birth control, and emotional complexity. Despite its eventual controversy and frequent challenges for its explicit content, the novel empowered young women by validating their curiosity and placing them as protagonists in their own sexual narratives. Its enduring legacy highlights a significant shift in how adolescent experiences were depicted in literature.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of basketball's EuroLeague, widely regarded as the second-best professional league in the world after the NBA. Established in 2000 by a group of top European clubs seeking more commercial control, the league operates with a mix of permanent member clubs and wildcard entries, including a new team from Dubai. The style of play is described as more tactical and team-oriented than the NBA, with a greater emphasis on every regular-season game. The league serves as both a destination for former NBA players and a high-level training ground for European talent aspiring to play in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Private holding company Ames Watson has purchased approximately 1,000 stores of the bankrupt tween retailer Claire's for $140 million, halting liquidation and planning a significant brand revitalization. The new owners diagnose Claire's as having a "broken business, not a broken brand," and intend to focus on overhauling merchandising, improving employee pay and training, and launching fresh marketing campaigns. Drawing on their successful turnaround of hat retailer Lids, they aim to modernize Claire's while preserving the nostalgic "rite of passage" identity that has been central to its appeal for generations.</p>
