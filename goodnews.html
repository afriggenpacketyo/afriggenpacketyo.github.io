          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX company's area in South Texas is now officially the city of Starbase, approved by residents in a local election where most voters were SpaceX employees. The city will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners, overseeing planning and taxation. Some nearby residents have voiced concerns about environmental impacts due to SpaceX's presence. A state bill could grant Starbase control over highway closures and beach access during launches, potentially causing conflict with Cameron County officials. The article highlights the ongoing development and regulatory issues surrounding Starbase and SpaceX's increasing operations in Texas.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a new adaptation of Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Broadway, playing all 26 roles with the aid of camerawork and technology. The play explores the parallels between Dorian's obsession with his image and modern social media culture, where maintaining an idealized aesthetic is paramount. Snook uses a smartphone to broadcast herself on a large screen, manipulating filters to create a false perfection, highlighting the gap between appearance and reality. The article contrasts this with "Vanya," another play where a single actor embodies multiple characters, suggesting different ways of imagining oneself and engaging with others.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a landslide victory in Australia's election, bolstered by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over the cost-of-living crisis. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the president's policies and the perception of his influence on the conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, contributed to Dutton's defeat. Voters expressed concerns about economic instability and the potential for erratic policy decisions mirroring those of the Trump administration. The results indicate a preference for stable, centrist politics and a rejection of Trump-inspired rhetoric.</p>
