        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 1,000 LGBTQ Catholics and their families completed a Jubilee pilgrimage through the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica, an event notably included for the first time on the Vatican’s official Holy Year calendar. This development, occurring under Pope Leo XIV's papacy and following Pope Francis's welcoming stance towards the LGBT community, has generated significant controversy. Many participants interpreted the pilgrimage as a profound sign of acceptance, with some expressing deep emotional connections to the experience. Conversely, traditionalist Catholic media and commentators strongly criticized the Vatican's decision, viewing it as an undermining of established Church doctrine. Vatican officials, however, maintained that the calendar entry was a logistical matter, not an endorsement, highlighting the complex and evolving dialogue within the Church regarding LGBTQ inclusion.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball memorabilia after a viral incident where an adult woman appeared to take a home run ball from him during a game against the Miami Marlins. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, whose father initially gave it to him before the woman intervened and claimed it. In response, a Marlins staffer gave the boy a gift bag, and Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who hit the home run, met the young fan and gave him an autographed bat. The heartwarming gestures aimed to rectify the disappointing experience for the child.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to broaden its public image and leadership beyond its prominent leader, Nigel Farage, as the party aims for significant electoral gains in upcoming years. The recent party conference showcased several new and aspiring politicians, like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, who are being promoted to the spotlight. The party is focused on increasing its candidate base and improving its vetting system, following past controversies, to build a robust 'people's army' for future elections. This article highlights Reform UK's strategic efforts to evolve from a 'one-man-band' into a more established political force.</p>

          <p>Former British soldier Dr. Bex Bennett, who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, is advocating for greater recognition and support for women who served in dangerous front-line military roles. Co-founding 'Sisters in Service,' a community interest company, Dr. Bennett aims to help female veterans, particularly those in healthcare, connect and support each other. The article highlights that many people still hold outdated ideas about women's roles in modern conflicts, often underestimating their direct involvement and the unique challenges they face post-service. This initiative seeks to provide a 'cathartic' space for women to share experiences that traditional veteran spaces might not offer.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively employing thousands of full-scale decoys, including inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery pieces, to deceive Russian forces and compel them to waste valuable ammunition. These imitations, ranging from M777 howitzers to drones, are strategically deployed to mimic real military equipment, often at a fraction of the cost of the weaponry used to target them. The article highlights how volunteers play a crucial role in supplying these mock-ups, which can be quickly assembled on the front line. Russia also uses similar tactics, deploying cheap imitation drones to overload Ukrainian air defenses, underscoring the widespread use of deception in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is on the path to becoming the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with his canonization ceremony presided over by Pope Leo XIV. Acutis, who died at 15 from leukemia, was known for creating websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname 'God's influencer.' His canonization, which required proof of two miracles, was fast-tracked by the Vatican, reportedly to inspire faith in young people. The article notes an increase in visitors to Our Lady of Dolours Church in Chelsea, where Acutis was baptized, and highlights the connection many young Catholics feel to his modern approach to faith.</p>
