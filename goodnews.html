          <p>Japan's defense minister hailed "unprecedented" security cooperation with Britain as the Royal Navy's Prince of Wales aircraft carrier made its first-ever port call to Tokyo, leading a 12-nation strike group. This landmark visit underscores Japan's strategic efforts to broaden its security alliances beyond the United States and highlights Britain's commitment to expanding its role in the economically vital Indo-Pacific region. Central to this partnership is the Global Combat Air Programme, a collaborative initiative with Italy to develop a next-generation fighter jet, with the initial international contract anticipated by year-end. Both nations emphasize the interconnectedness of Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security.</p>

          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, Malaysia's top deep-sea robotics scientist, has relocated to China, accepting a deanship at Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's Entrepreneur College in Jiangsu. He explained that China offers a robust ecosystem for rapidly transitioning research into industrial applications, fostering direct collaboration with businesses to address real-world challenges, and providing readily available components for prototype development. Rizal, an expert in ocean robotics, believes the future lies in the ocean as a source for drinking water, food, minerals, and power, making China an ideal base for advancing marine robot applications. This strategic move underscores China's increasing influence in attracting global scientific talent and its commitment to deep-sea innovation.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined. India's Nifty 50 slipped following the implementation of secondary U.S. tariffs on Indian shipments, raising concerns about economic growth risks. Major company news included Lynas Rare Earths' capital raise and Qantas' record-high shares due to strong earnings, while Nvidia's stock dipped post-earnings despite exceeding revenue expectations due to data center and China sales concerns.

          <p>A "one-in-a-million" tennis photograph, captured by Ray Giubilo at the US Open, has achieved widespread acclaim for its unique and humorous quality, with player Jasmine Paolini hailing it as "the picture of the year." The whimsical image, taken by complete fluke during Paolini's first-round match, was made possible by her momentary off-balance posture during a forehand stroke. Giubilo, a seasoned photographer with 37 years on the circuit, instantly recognized the shot's exceptional nature. This article celebrates the rarity of such comedic and sublime moments in the often-intense world of sports photography, underscoring the patience and impeccable technical skill required to capture truly iconic and unexpected images.</p>

          <h2>UK Car Exports to US Increase After New Tariff Agreement</h2>

          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the United States rose in July, reversing a three-month decline, following the implementation of a new UK-US tariff deal. The agreement lowered the import tax on UK cars from an initial proposed 25% to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles annually. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) highlighted the deal's impact, stressing the US remains the largest single national market for British cars. Despite this positive development, overall UK car manufacturing output for the year remains down, attributed to factors like higher labor costs, increased overseas competition, and Brexit.

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% surge in second-quarter revenue to $46.7 billion, driven by robust demand from major tech firms expanding their AI capabilities. CEO Jensen Huang noted the "AI race is now on," with significant spending from companies like Meta and OpenAI. Despite this boom, Nvidia continues to navigate US-China trade tensions, including the Trump administration's policies on chip exports, which caused its shares to dip slightly in after-hours trading due to data center revenue missing estimates and concerns over China sales. Analysts highlight Nvidia's central, largely unchallenged role in the AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement sparked an outpouring of intense emotional reactions from fans, illustrating the concept of "parasocial relationships"—one-sided friendships with celebrities. This article explores how increased access to celebrities' private lives through social media fosters an illusion of intimacy, making fans feel deeply invested. While such relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, particularly during times like the pandemic, experts caution that they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life interactions. Sociologists note that humans are wired to form social bonds, even with public figures, but these digital connections lack the "nutritional content" of genuine friendships.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's film "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life unravels after a car accident and a fateful cat-sitting gig plunge him into a violent crime caper in 1998 Lower East Side Manhattan. The movie portrays a gritty, pre-millennial New York, filled with diverse criminal elements and a hard-nosed NYPD detective. The review praises Aronofsky's affectionate yet grimy depiction of the city and Butler's portrayal of a self-loathing alcoholic grappling with squandered potential. The film is described as a "bruising bacchanal" that delves into themes of identity and the burden of talent.</p>

A single jackpot winner faces the choice of a lump sum payment or an annuity spread over 29 years. The odds of claiming the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, as the jackpot continues to grow since its last win on May 31.</p>

The BOK upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%.

          <p>Florida's Everglades are now home to robot rabbits, the latest technological tool in the battle against invasive Burmese pythons, which are decimating native wildlife. These solar-powered robotic lures mimic real marsh rabbits by emitting heat, smell, and natural movements, drawing pythons into monitored pens for removal. The South Florida Water Management District and University of Florida researchers deployed 120 such robots, a more cost-effective method than using live animals. With pythons lacking natural enemies and laying numerous eggs, officials are optimistic about the robots' potential to improve detection and control efforts, despite the project being in its early stages.</p>
