          <h2>Boeing Shows Signs of Stabilization Under New Leadership Amidst Lingering Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 06:37:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago, Boeing is showing signs of stabilizing after a prolonged period of crises. The company's aircraft production has increased, deliveries have hit an 18-month high, and its stock has risen over 30% this year, with analysts expecting a return to annual profitability by next year. Despite this progress, which has earned praise from airline customers like Ryanair, Boeing still faces significant hurdles, including FAA production caps on the 737 Max and ongoing issues within its defense unit. The turnaround remains a work in progress as the company navigates intense scrutiny and works to rebuild trust and operational consistency.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire following deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was reached during talks in Malaysia, chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as head of the ASEAN regional bloc. The conflict, which escalated after a land mine explosion, prompted international pressure, including from the United States, which warned of potential impacts on trade deals. Both nations' leaders hailed the outcome, committing to de-escalate and return to normalcy after a rare instance of open military confrontation between ASEAN members.</p>

          <h2>Rupert Murdoch's Standoff with Trump Over Epstein Story Raises Questions About Media's Role</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 06:30:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is positioning his Wall Street Journal to legally contest a $10 billion lawsuit from Donald Trump, a move that contrasts sharply with other major news outlets that have yielded to pressure. The lawsuit stems from a Journal article suggesting Trump sent an inappropriate drawing to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a claim Trump denies. This article analyzes Murdoch's motivations, suggesting they could range from a strategic business decision to a personal desire for revenge or even a late-career effort to protect press freedom. Despite his controversial past, the 94-year-old's defiance makes him an unlikely, and potentially final, defender of journalistic integrity against political intimidation.</p>

          <h2>Philosophical Framework Offers Guidance for Navigating Life's Most Difficult Decisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 06:30:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This advice column explores how to approach major life decisions, such as choosing between a high-paying corporate law career and a lower-paying public service role. Drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang, the article argues that such 'hard choices' are not difficult because one option is secretly better, but because the alternatives are 'on a par,' offering different but equally valid kinds of value. Instead of relying on pro/con lists, individuals must exercise their own agency to create reasons for their choice, thereby defining who they want to be. This act of choosing, the article suggests, is a fundamental and empowering aspect of human freedom.</p>

          <p>Nash Keen, an Iowa baby recognized by Guinness World Records as the most premature to survive, has celebrated his first birthday. Born at just 21 weeks gestation and weighing only 10 ounces, Nash's survival defied medical odds. His mother had previously lost a child at 18 weeks and was diagnosed with an incompetent cervix, making this pregnancy high-risk. After 198 days in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Health Care Stead Family Children’s Hospital, Nash went home and continues to receive monitoring and therapy for developmental delays, serving as a source of hope and a testament to advances in neonatal care.</p>

          <p>Stargazers are encouraged to look for meteors this week, as the Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha Capricornids showers are set to peak on the night of July 29-30. Unlike the more famous Perseid meteor shower in August, which will be obscured by a bright moon this year, this week's showers will occur with the moon only about 25% full, offering better viewing conditions. Together, these two showers could produce 20 to 30 meteors per hour, with the Alpha Capricornids known for occasional slow-moving fireballs. For the best experience, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights and allowing eyes to adjust for 15-30 minutes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has disbursed over $230 million to California dairy farms to compensate for milk production losses caused by the H5N1 bird flu. The virus has impacted more than 75% of the state's dairies since August 2024, leading to sick cattle, reduced milk output, and increased animal deaths. The financial relief comes from a USDA program, but critics from groups like Farm Forward argue that these subsidies support industrial-scale operations that may contribute to the spread of such outbreaks. Dairy industry representatives maintain that the aid has been crucial for keeping farms in business and ensuring a stable food supply.</p>

          <p>A new true-crime book, "The Carpool Detectives," chronicles the remarkable story of four Los Angeles mothers who solved a cold case murder during the pandemic. With backgrounds in forensic accounting, political research, and project management, the women teamed up to investigate the mysterious disappearance and death of an older couple from two decades prior. After two and a half years of navigating dead ends and working with reluctant law enforcement, they successfully identified the perpetrator. The experience has reportedly revolutionized their lives, giving them a new sense of purpose as they now tackle an even bigger case involving a potential serial killer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic for weight loss and other potential health benefits is raising critical questions about their long-term impact on the human brain. These medications work by mimicking a gut hormone that slows digestion and, crucially, crosses into the brain to suppress dopamine release, which affects cravings for food, alcohol, and other compulsive behaviors. While this can be beneficial, scientists are cautiously investigating what it means to modulate our fundamental desires. Experts are still uncertain whether these drugs can selectively reduce harmful compulsions without dampening the productive drives and joys that define the human experience.</p>

The cubs were born on June 17 to mother Xiao and father Flint, who was brought from Belfast Zoo in 2024 with the hope of future breeding. The species, native to the eastern Himalayas and China, is on the decline due to threats like poaching and deforestation. The zoo expressed its delight at the birth and confirmed the cubs are being monitored via CCTV, as they will remain in their nest boxes for at least three months.</p>

          <p>Starting in July 2026, Minnesota will become the first state to require social media platforms to display a pop-up warning label to users before they log on. The label will state that prolonged use can be hazardous to mental health, a measure inspired by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's call for such warnings. Supported by state Democrats and some Republicans, the law aims to encourage more mindful online behavior, especially among young people. Tech industry group NetChoice opposes the law, arguing it compels private companies to carry the state's message, and has indicated it may sue to block enforcement.</p>

          <p>Scientists are recognizing that some children have a naturally stronger food reward drive, making them more susceptible to overeating ultra-processed foods. These children often feel hungrier, eat faster, and struggle with satiety signals, which can lead to health problems in an environment where such foods are ubiquitous. Psychologists suggest that standard advice may not work for these kids and recommend tailored strategies for parents. This includes keeping ultra-processed foods out of the home, limiting variety, and focusing on a foundation of whole or minimally processed foods to help children regulate their eating habits more effectively.</p>
