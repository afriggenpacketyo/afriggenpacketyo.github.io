          <p>Elon Musk, a major donor in the 2024 election, announced plans to decrease his future political spending. Speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk stated he believes he has "done enough" and doesn't currently see a reason to continue significant political contributions. This marks a shift from his previous commitment to play a major role in future elections through his America PAC. Despite his substantial support for the Republican Party and President Trump, some within the GOP have reportedly grown wary of Musk's involvement, especially after controversies surrounding his role in DOGE.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, investors are considering adding the precious metal to their portfolios; however, it's important to manage risks strategically in today's volatile economic climate. Experts recommend limiting gold investments to a maximum of 10% of an overall portfolio, focusing on secure investment types like gold bars and coins rather than riskier options such as mining stocks. Monitoring the economic climate is also crucial to determine potential selling opportunities and ensure gold continues to serve as a reliable hedge against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his legislative agenda, cautioning them against altering Medicaid provisions. During a closed-door meeting, Trump reportedly urged Republicans not to "mess with Medicaid" and to back his bill, despite opposition from hard-liners seeking stricter cuts. He also addressed concerns over state and local tax deductions, encouraging Republicans to accept the current deal. The White House official stated that Trump is losing patience with Republican holdouts. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are discussing former President Biden's recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer, which had spread to his bones, raising questions about screening practices. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, but many men continue screening into their 70s. Some experts noted that aggressive cancers can develop even with regular screenings. The PSA test, while common, is not foolproof and can miss fast-growing cancers. The article highlights the complexities and limitations of prostate cancer screening and the potential risks of treatment for slow-growing cancers.</p>

He also noted that he will be attending a dinner with Trump on Wednesday, proof that the executive is still in Trump's inner circle, even if his prominence appears to be waning. Musk funneled nearly $300 million into the campaign of President Trump, becoming a top political donor and a symbolically potent ally of the president.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers could receive approximately ¬£70 each following a court ruling that deemed historic fees administered by Mastercard as unfair. The decision comes after a decade-long legal case brought forward by a former financial ombudsman, who argued shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland are eligible to claim compensation. The entire settlement is for ¬£200m, with ¬£100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of this year to claim.</p>
