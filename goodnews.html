          <h2>Democrats Need Persuasion, Not Just Left-Wing Media, to Win Back Voters</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece from Fox News argues that Democrats need to focus on persuasion and finding common ground with a broader range of Americans, rather than solely relying on left-wing media. The author, chief of staff to Congressman Ro Khanna, recounts how Khanna engaged in productive dialogue with conservative media host Glenn Beck despite disagreements. The piece advocates for Democrats to be fearless in reaching voters where they are, tailoring their message without compromising their values, and balancing viral moments with nuanced messages about complex issues. The author suggests that Democrats should aim to persuade figures like Joe Rogan, who has drifted away from supporting Democratic candidates. </p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach for Raising Resilient Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert proposes a new framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents focus on their own inner healing to become less reactive and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. The article suggests practical steps for parents to implement this style, including reflecting on their own childhood triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame during conflicts.</p>
