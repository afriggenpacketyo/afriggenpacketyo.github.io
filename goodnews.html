          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts intends to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's authorization to enroll international students.  This action follows the administration's threat to force existing international students to transfer or lose their legal status.  Harvard is suing the Department of Homeland Security, arguing the administration's actions violate constitutional rights and established legal procedures. The Trump administration's notice giving Harvard 30 days to respond adds further context to the ongoing legal battle.</p>

          <p>The recent US court ruling blocking some tariffs has limited immediate impact on the existing US-UK trade deal, as the affected tariffs don't include those on cars, steel, and aluminum‚Äîthe major UK exports to the US.  While a deal exists to reduce tariffs on these items, it's not yet in effect.  The ruling does impact blanket tariffs on other UK goods, creating uncertainty. The situation highlights the complexities and unpredictability of international trade negotiations.</p>
