          <p>Communities across the globe have been celebrating Pride Month with parades and festivals, marking the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion.

The article showcases a collection of photos from various events, from Washington, D.C., to Kathmandu, highlighting the vibrant and diverse ways people are commemorating the month.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus examines the life and influence of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of the National Review and a pivotal figure in the American conservative movement. The book, 'Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America,' argues that Buckley created the framework for modern cultural politics and paved the way for figures from Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump. Tanenhaus suggests Buckley's intellectual and celebrity status helped make conservatism a dominant force in the Republican Party. The biography explores his controversial stances, including his opposition to civil rights legislation, and his role in elevating the political careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.</p>

The focus will be on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the monthly nonfarm payrolls report for June, which are expected to show a continued but gradual cooling of the job market. These figures will be critical for gauging the health of the economy and influencing the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. Additionally, the market will be attentive to any updates from the White House regarding ongoing trade negotiations and the progress of the Republican tax and spending bill.

          <p>The UK's Labour government narrowly avoided a major parliamentary defeat on its welfare reform bill after making significant concessions to a large group of its own rebellious MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concerns raised by over 120 backbenchers led to a strengthened plan. The changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit rises with inflation. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the U-turn, indicating they will now support the bill, which aims to reduce the nation's welfare spending.</p>

Corenswet, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, emphasizes his desire to embody the character's loneliness and his desperate wish to be part of humanity.

The reassurance came during an urgent meeting following reports that the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the United States, which would have threatened 1,300 jobs. Lotus had paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to US tariffs, which are set to be reduced.

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for major supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to partner in an effort to tackle obesity. Rather than imposing strict rules, the strategy will encourage retailers to voluntarily find ways to make healthy food more appealing and accessible. Potential measures could include offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or redesigning store layouts. The plan, which will involve businesses reporting on healthy food sales to increase accountability, aims to relieve pressure on the NHS by improving the nation's diet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering 'no' to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel like a team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, are genuinely curious about each other's inner worlds, and take accountability for their mistakes. The article argues that while many know the components of a healthy relationship, they often don't recognize what they look like in practice. A negative response to these points could suggest a relationship is running on autopilot, lacking intimacy, or burdened by unresolved resentment.</p>

          <p>This analysis challenges the narrative that Gen Z is simply having less sex, arguing that this 'sex recession' is part of a broader, politically charged sexual revolution. While statistics show a decline in sexual activity compared to previous generations, the author contends that Gen Z is actively redefining sex, gender, and relationships in response to a politically hostile environment, particularly after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The generation is described as the most sexually progressive in history, seeking to dismantle traditional expectations and infuse their personal lives with political meaning, even as they navigate unprecedented restrictions on their freedoms.</p>

She finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and sees implementation as outside their role. At a startup, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, get into the details to devise a solution, and then personally see it through. To assess this, she asks candidates to describe a past problem they solved, listening for a detailed explanation of the process and a genuine excitement for both sides of the work.</p>

The business, which offers rooms and all-inclusive workshops, is not yet profitable but generated $22,000 in revenue last year, helping to cover the chateau's significant expenses.
