          <p>Mortgage rates have increased for the third consecutive week, reaching their highest level since January, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rising to 6.98%. Despite the increase in rates, mortgage applications for home purchases rose by 2% compared to the previous week and are 18% higher than the same week last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Joel Kan, an MBA economist, attributes this to increased housing inventory supporting transaction volume despite economic uncertainty. Applications to refinance a home loan fell by 7% for the week, although refinance demand remains 37% higher than a year ago.</p>

          <p>The term "Maycember" describes the convergence of numerous expenses in May, creating financial stress similar to December. Isabel Barrow from Edelman Financial Engines advises against panicking and suggests reviewing spending and reassessing financial plans to regain control. Experts recommend addressing credit card debt immediately, choosing a repayment strategy like the avalanche or snowball method, and automating savings to rebuild after overspending. Lazetta Rainey Braxton suggests scaling back on discretionary spending by packing picnics and finding free events and exploring side gigs to accelerate debt repayment; it is also prudent to plan ahead for the following year by tracking expenses to better budget for future events.</p>
