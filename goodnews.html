          <p>Microsoft has announced its entry into the handheld console market with the ROG Xbox Ally, developed in partnership with Asus, after years of speculation. The device will allow gamers to access their Game Pass library on the go and comes in two versions: the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, differing in memory, storage, battery, and processor. The handhelds run Windows, providing access to various gaming platforms like Steam and EA Play, but are heavier than the Nintendo Switch 2. Microsoft also revealed new games coming to Game Pass PC & Ultimate, including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 and Ninja Gaiden 4, but there was no mention of Switch 2 compatibility for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The new Persona 4 remake, subtitled Revival, is set to be remade 17 years after it was first released on PlayStation 2. </p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced plans to increase investment in the United Kingdom's artificial intelligence sector, citing the country's "Goldilocks circumstance." Huang emphasized the UK's rich AI community, including startups like DeepMind and Wayve, but noted a lack of homegrown AI infrastructure. Nvidia unveiled a new UK sovereign AI industry forum and commitments from cloud vendors Nscale and Nebius to deploy facilities with Blackwell GPU chips. The UK government aims to boost the domestic AI sector, relaxing planning rules for data centers and increasing computing power by twenty-fold by 2030. Huang believes the ability to build AI supercomputers in the UK will attract more startups.</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart, who turned 80 in January, revealed his fitness regimen includes underwater training with a brick, inspired by Frank Sinatra's advice for singers to develop powerful lungs. He also incorporates 100-meter sprints on his private track, aiming to beat his current record of 19 seconds. Stewart mentioned he works out at least four days a week, alternating between running, swimming, and soccer, and rests his voice before shows by avoiding talking for eight hours. Despite recent concert cancellations due to the flu, Stewart affirmed he has no desire to retire and will continue his Las Vegas residency until October.</p>

          <p>Faced with water scarcity and rapid population growth, St. George, Utah, is investing over a billion dollars in a wastewater reclamation plant to reuse sewage. The treated wastewater will initially be used for irrigation, freeing up drinking water for homes, and eventually be integrated directly into the drinking supply. This project is part of a broader effort to address water challenges in the American West, where overuse and drought are straining the Colorado River. Other conservation measures include eliminating grass in new developments and incentivizing residents to remove lawns, inspired by successful strategies in Las Vegas.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend a ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The move aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed warning of irreversible destruction without urgent action. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference where countries are urged to ratify a treaty to protect a third of international waters by 2030.</p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are gaining popularity, with companies claiming they can revolutionize health, but their benefits for people without diabetes are debated. These devices, approved by the FDA for non-diabetics, track blood sugar levels and help users monitor the impact of food on their glucose levels. Studies show mixed results, with some indicating CGMs can aid in weight loss and blood sugar control, while others suggest they offer no significant advantage over traditional diets. Experts recommend CGMs for those sensitive to carbohydrates, needing motivation to eat healthier, or seeking increased dietary awareness, but caution against potential data misinterpretation and unnecessary anxiety about normal blood sugar fluctuations.
