          <p>This article details the arrest of two suspects in Brazil who were allegedly planning a bomb attack on a Lady Gaga concert at Copacabana Beach. The suspects, reportedly fans of the singer, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, aimed to preempt any threat ahead of the singer's historic performance on Saturday night, which drew over two million fans to Rio's iconic beachfront. Despite the threat, the concert proceeded without incident, and Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the fact.</p>
