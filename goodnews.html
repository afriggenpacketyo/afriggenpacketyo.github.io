        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora is preparing for potential price increases across the affordable jewelry sector due to proposed U.S. tariff hikes. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that while current 10% tariffs are manageable, higher 'reciprocal' rates would significantly impact manufacturers who rely on Asian production. Pandora, heavily dependent on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, previously warned of a substantial revenue hit from tariffs announced in April. The company has modeled various scenarios to determine the final figure for potential consumer price rises, suggesting the increase will likely be industry-wide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed earnings exceeding analyst expectations, but revenue fell short of anticipated growth, causing a 5% stock drop. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, while net income rose to $1.78 billion, a significant improvement from the previous year's net loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi anticipates gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the current quarter. The company faces an FTC lawsuit over 'deceptive billing and cancellation practices' related to its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi disputes. Uber is also expanding its autonomous vehicle initiatives with partnerships and has reached an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.</p>

          <p>A new approach to fighting respiratory diseases, called 'far-UVC,' is showing promise. This type of ultraviolet light can kill airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes. Imagine placing lamps in schools, hospitals, and offices to eliminate the majority of airborne diseases. New advancements in solid-state lamps and secondary harmonics are making far-UVC disinfection cheaper and more accessible. Research is also tentatively suggesting that the ozone effects of far-UVC are not concerningly large, particularly when lamps are placed on the ceiling to minimize exposure.</p>

Early columns, often framed as 'ladies issues,' addressed timeless dilemmas of love and relationships, reflecting evolving gender politics. Prominent 20th-century columnists like Dorothy Dix and Elsie Robinson offered progressive views on women's rights, while others reinforced traditional gender roles. Today, crowdsourced advice online is more democratic but also more diffuse, reflecting both greater autonomy and confusion in navigating modern relationships.</p>
