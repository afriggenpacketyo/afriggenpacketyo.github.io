          <h2>China Considers Fentanyl Cooperation with U.S. as Trade War Leverage</h2>

          <p>Chinese officials are reportedly considering offering deeper cooperation with the United States on combating fentanyl production and trafficking, potentially sending a high-ranking security official to Washington to initiate trade talks. This New York Times article details how China has historically used its willingness to cooperate on fentanyl as leverage in broader disputes with the U.S., particularly concerning tariffs. While China denies responsibility for the fentanyl crisis, attributing it to U.S. domestic issues, this move could signal a shift towards de-escalation amid growing economic pressures from the ongoing trade war. China hopes that a pledge to address fentanyl concerns will facilitate simultaneous tariff reductions from both governments, providing a face-saving resolution. </p>
