          <p>An article introduces "emotionally safe parenting," a new parenting style focused on creating a secure environment where children feel comfortable expressing their emotions. This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, encouraging parents to respond to children's emotions without shame or dismissal. Emotionally safe parents view challenging behavior as a signal for support, not defiance, and prioritize reconnection after conflicts. The article suggests that practicing this style involves doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but he was equally excited to discuss the retrieval of his truck, which had been repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and forgotten to update his automatic payment settings for his Ford F-150, leading to the repossession. He discovered the truck was missing when his trainer asked him to check security camera footage, and he shared the footage on social media, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On."</p>

He notes that the U.S. market has been affected by trade tensions and interest rate concerns. Despite European markets showing strength, Cramer and his team highlight the historical outperformance of the U.S. market and the global exposure already present in S&P 500 companies.

          <p>The story of Julie Moore, an Army spouse who, in 1965, after her husband served in the Vietnam War, helped change military protocol by ensuring families received death notifications in person rather than by telegram. Moore worked with the local Western Union office to be notified of telegrams, and then rushed to comfort the widows. The Army made a fundamental change, taking responsibility for delivering these telegrams to the wives and personally caring for the spouse during that time of cathartic change. This year, the Army post was re-named Ft. Benning, and it became Ft. Moore to honor them both.</p>
