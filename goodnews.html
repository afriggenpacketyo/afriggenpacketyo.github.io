          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as the national security adviser, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council, reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. Some teams focusing on specific regions or issues will be significantly reduced or eliminated, aligning with President Trump's top-down approach to foreign policy debates. Vice President JD Vance‚Äôs national security adviser Andy Baker will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser, as is White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel.</p>

The facilities planning and management department responded to the leak, shut off the water, and initiated repairs, but there is no estimated timeline for the building's reopening.

          <p>A new study in Global Change Biology reveals that the increasing use of hummingbird feeders has altered the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender, allowing them to extract more nectar from feeders, while males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbirds have also expanded their range northward, adapting to cooler temperatures due to the availability of feeders. Researchers analyzed newspaper archives and museum specimens to track the changes over ten generations, demonstrating the rapid pace of evolution in response to human influence.</p>

Critics argue that citizens are unaware of being scanned and that the technology poses a threat to fundamental rights.

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned President Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm employing a lawyer who investigated him. The order had suspended security clearances and restricted access to government buildings for the firm's lawyers. Judge John D. Bates ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, mirroring a previous ruling against a similar order targeting Perkins Coie. Bates stated that Trump's order targeted Jenner & Block because of the causes it champions, the clients it represents, and a lawyer it once employed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's attempts to block international students from attending Harvard University, responding to Harvard's lawsuit accusing the administration of a "campaign of retribution." The university argued that stopping the flow of international students would destabilize the school. The judge agreed that the university had shown that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university. The lawsuit followed the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, halting its ability to enroll international students.</p>

          <p>Scott McTominay, after a season plundering goals, has secured his place as a Napoli legend, helping them to the Serie A title. McTominay scored the opening goal in a victory against Cagliari. McTominay was also named Serie A's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for 2024-25. Leaving Manchester United for Napoli last summer proved to be an inspired decision. There have been tattoos, flags, cakes and even a shrine of McTominay.</p>
