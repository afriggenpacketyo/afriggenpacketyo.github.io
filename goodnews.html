          <p>In Bristol, street sex workers are collaborating with the police and a charity to safeguard at-risk children, offering crucial insights into child exploitation through the Night Light initiative. These women, often the eyes and ears of the night, provide vital information that aids in prosecuting child sex offenders and identifying vulnerable underage girls, with one sex worker even playing a key role in bringing a man who was abusing his daughter to justice. The Night Light team, which started in 2020, conducts regular patrols to engage with sex workers and young individuals, fostering trust and providing support, food, and clothing. Many of the sex workers, having experienced sexual assault themselves, are passionate about preventing similar situations for young people, expressing a desire for such a program to have existed during their own childhoods.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom following Newsom's proposal for a federal film tax credit aimed at revitalizing the American film industry. Newsom's proposal came after Trump announced potential 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., citing the industry's decline. Trump, while acknowledging a past good relationship with Newsom, also criticized California's high-speed rail project and the handling of wildfires. The article highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the film industry, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Hollywood strikes, as well as the potential effects of proposed tariffs and tax incentives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist, argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, dubbed the "Mar-a-Lago Accord," is based on a flawed understanding of trade imbalances. Rogoff contends that while the dollar's reserve currency status plays a role, it is only one of many factors contributing to America's persistent trade deficits. He suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more effective solution than launching a trade war. The article also highlights the strength of the American economy as a key factor behind the current account deficit, making US businesses attractive to investors.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amidst ongoing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and unleash additional liquidity into the market. These measures are designed to support key sectors such as technology and real estate, as well as boost consumption and elderly care.

The bill follows calls for change from the families of murdered individuals whose killers did not attend their sentencing hearings. The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>
