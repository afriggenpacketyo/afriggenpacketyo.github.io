          <p>Philadelphia Phillies relief pitcher Jose Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for exogenous testosterone, violating Major League Baseball's drug policy. The Phillies expressed their disappointment and support for MLB's Joint Prevention and Treatment Program. Alvarado, a key member of the Phillies' bullpen since joining the team in 2021, will be ineligible for the postseason. The team will now rely more heavily on other relievers to fill the void left by Alvarado's absence.</p>

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny used a language barrier to explore the dynamics of relationships. Two couples at a bar engage in a heated argument that is misinterpreted by nearby onlookers due to language differences. The sketch highlighted the gap between what non-Spanish speakers perceived and what the Spanish-speaking characters were actually saying, revealing deeper relationship issues. The skit was nuanced, showing how people often misinterpret situations based on assumptions and cultural biases, rather than understanding the true subtext.</p>

Speculation surrounds the potential departure of Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, and how the show will continue to lampoon modern politics. The 50th anniversary celebrations served as a potent reminder that there is no other program like it on American television.</p>

Hawaiian leis are given for nearly every occasion, representing an expression of aloha and love. However, the future of lei making is in peril due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the fact that a lei only lasts around two or three days. Some lei makers are adapting by using non-traditional materials, such as wood beads and unripe fruit, to create "forever leis."</p>
