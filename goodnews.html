          <p>An article reports that public transportation services in Japan are implementing AI to improve lost-and-found operations. Find Inc.'s platform, used by 30 organizations at 2,300 locations, utilizes AI to categorize and catalog lost items based on photos taken by staff. Owners can inquire through messaging apps, entering item details, and the AI matches the description to the database. Keio Corp. has seen a significant increase in the return rate of lost possessions, and Yurikamome Inc. has reduced inquiry volume, with users expressing gratitude for the convenient service. The system has handled 1.5 million lost items, returning around 480,000.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce his first trade agreement since implementing tariffs that roiled stock markets. Trump hinted at the announcement on social media, stating that the deal is with "A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY," but did not reveal the country's name or the terms of the agreement. The announcement comes after a period of trade talks with partners following the imposition of tariffs on imported goods and reciprocal tariffs aimed at countries with unfavorable trading practices. The administration has engaged in talks with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and India.</p>

          <p>Apple is asking a court to pause a recent contempt ruling in its case against Epic Games, seeking to reinstate commissions on in-app transactions that link out for payment. A judge had found Apple in violation of an earlier order to allow developers to link to external payment options. Apple argues that the required changes would cost the company "substantial sums." Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes the ruling forces Apple to compete. The judge also made a criminal referral, saying Apple misled the court about its reasons for charging 27% for external payments.</p>

          <p>Kavan Markwood, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet from his seat at PNC Park, is recovering "ahead of schedule," according to doctors and family. Markwood sustained injuries to his skull, brain, spine, ribs, and lungs, but has since been taken off the breathing machine and out of intensive care. Doctors believe cognitive rehab will be one of the most critical aspects of his recovery. While the exact cause of the accident remains unclear, an investigation is ongoing, and family members have expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. defended the independence of the judiciary and denounced attempts to impeach judges over disagreements with their rulings.

His remarks follow a similar statement in March in response to threats by President Trump and his allies to impeach federal judges who have issued decisions against administration policies. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also recently denounced attacks on the judiciary, citing increased threats and professional retaliation against judges.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags to circumvent Republican-led bans on flying unofficial flags on government property. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed three new city flags featuring the city's traditional sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag. These actions are a direct response to state laws restricting the types of flags that can be flown on government property.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares increased following the Trump administration's plan to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have restricted the export of advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce spokesperson stated that the rule was overly complex and would stifle American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the decision, stating that it would allow America to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need to balance national security with boosting the American chip industry.
