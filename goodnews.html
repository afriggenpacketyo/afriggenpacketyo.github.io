          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 02:41:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This translates to an annual bill reduction of ¬£129 for a typical household, reflecting a drop in international wholesale gas prices. However, charities emphasize that many individuals still struggle with energy costs, with customers owing approximately ¬£4 billion to suppliers. The announcement follows recent discussions about potential changes to winter fuel payments for pensioners, adding further complexity to the energy landscape.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart has temporarily stopped selling Labubu dolls in its UK stores until June due to reports of customers fighting over the popular toys. The decision follows incidents of chaos and unsafe conditions witnessed by customers, fueled by the dolls' viral status on TikTok and resale market. Pop Mart is working on a fairer system for when the dolls return to shelves, but fans have expressed anger at resellers driving up prices. Retail experts suggest the scarcity and blind box sales strategy contributed to the frenzy, potentially harming the brand's image.</p>

While advocates support the move, others highlight the penny's utility in charity drives and cheaper production cost compared to the nickel, requiring Congressional legislation for price rounding to eliminate demand.</p>
