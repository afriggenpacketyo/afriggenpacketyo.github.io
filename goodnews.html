          <p>The White House has asserted that Canada "caved" to President Trump by revoking its planned digital services tax (DST). The reversal came after Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations if the tax, which would have affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. White House officials framed the move as a significant victory for American workers and businesses. Top economic aide Kevin Hassett suggested the U.S. will now pressure other countries to drop similar taxes as part of future trade talks, signaling an aggressive stance against what it deems unfair trade practices targeting American firms.</p>

The decision follows a meeting between Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that sanctions were hindering the new transitional government's ability to function.</p>

It explains the psychological and tactical advantages of quickly finishing an innings, noting that England has historically struggled in this area.
