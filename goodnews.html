          <p>Journalist Mark Whitaker examines the enduring influence of Malcolm X, the charismatic Black leader, in his book "The Afterlife of Malcolm X." The book delves into the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the 1992 biopic "Malcolm X," which dramatized Malcolm Little's transformation from a street hustler to a civil rights leader. Whitaker explores how Malcolm's message of self-defense, Black pride, and cultural assertion continues to resonate in today's fractious politics.

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly damaging to relationships. The phrase communicates that the person is not enough and someone else could do a better job as a partner. This can lead to insecurity issues and questioning of worth. The phrase is often a symptom of a deeper dysfunction: the fear of openly speaking up about needs. Happiness in a relationship can only be achieved when we communicate what we need clearly, without shame or comparison.</p>
