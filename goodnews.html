          <p>China is investing heavily in the digitalization of museums and cultural heritage sites to preserve history, strengthen national pride, promote technological progress, and enhance its soft power. This initiative aims to build a "cultural superpower" by engaging new generations through technology, exemplified by the digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo at Dafo Temple. Despite economic challenges, Beijing continues to prioritize cultural initiatives, contrasting with Western countries that are cutting funding for cultural heritage. The digitalization effort reflects China's ambition to blend ancient history with modern technology. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to move abroad for up to two years. The arrangement would be "reciprocal" but specific details regarding age eligibility and number caps are yet to be provided. Critics, including Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, have described the possible scheme as "free movement through the back door." An agreement in principle is expected to be announced at an upcoming summit in London. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned it would have to raise prices due to tariffs, stating that Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" instead of charging customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had noted significant price increases due to tariffs, creating a challenging environment for retailers. Other companies, including Microsoft and Mattel, have also announced price increases or production shifts due to tariffs. Walmart affirmed its commitment to keeping prices low despite the tariff pressures. </p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth," in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth and flaps for swimming. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals that the Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts. The well-preserved fossil showed the Mosura's open circulatory system and unique body structure. </p>
