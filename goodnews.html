          <p>The South American trade bloc Mercosur has signed a free trade agreement with the four-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Finalized after a decade of negotiations, the deal aims to create a free trade area for nearly 300 million people by removing customs duties and improving market access for over 97% of exports. The comprehensive agreement covers goods, services, investment, and intellectual property rights. The deal still requires ratification by the parliaments of all member countries in both blocs.</p>

          <p>Women's Euro 2025 host nation Switzerland was defeated 2-1 by Norway in their opening match in Basel, despite taking an early lead. A late own goal from Swiss defender Julia Stierli decided the game, making Switzerland the first host nation to lose its opening match in the tournament's history. Despite the loss in front of a sold-out crowd of over 34,000, head coach Pia Sundhage remains optimistic about her team's chances to advance to the quarterfinals. The tournament is seen as a pivotal moment to boost the growth of women's football in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman who has lived in the U.S. since she was a child, was released from an ICE detention center after nearly five months in custody. She was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon, despite being married to a U.S. citizen and having a pending green card application. Her legal team stated her release followed intense legal pressure and public outcry, condemning what they called unconstitutional attempts by ICE to deport her. Her lawyers criticized the administration's immigration policies, arguing she was targeted because of her Palestinian identity.</p>

President Trump invited the pilots and their crews to be celebrated as heroes, but for security reasons, no public ceremony is planned and their identities will not be disclosed. The Air Force cited the need to protect personnel involved in sensitive missions from potential targeting by adversaries who exploit open-source information.

Cramer also noted that the dollar's decline to a four-year low is beneficial for U.S.-based consumer packaged goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble, as it makes their exports more competitive on the global market.

Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index-tracking funds must purchase the company's shares to rebalance their portfolios.

Ayton's arrival addresses a key need for the Lakers, providing a significant defensive presence and lob target in the paint, a role they struggled to fill last season.

The article highlights how Valens transformed traditional sounds into something new, most famously with his rock version of the Mexican folk song "La Bamba." It also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," and how the re-recorded soundtrack by Los Lobos introduced his music to a new generation.

Fury, who retired in January after his second loss to Usyk, fueled the speculation by posting a photo with Alalshikh and writing, "Let's see what 2026 brings." Fury also mentioned interest in a potential revenge match against Usyk or a major all-British fight against Anthony Joshua.</p>
