          <p>Former President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men were found guilty in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they freed the marine animals, believing the line was illegal. Although they avoided prison time, they were ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, owning firearms, and international travel. Their attorney expressed that justice has finally prevailed and that the prosecution was unjust. </p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation has fallen to 1.9% in May, according to flash data from Eurostat, dipping below the European Central Bank's 2% target. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, tobacco, and alcohol, also eased to 2.3% in May, while services inflation cooled to 3.2%. The figures will be considered by the ECB as it prepares to make its next interest rate decision later this week, with markets pricing in a high chance of a further 25-basis-point rate cut. Despite global economic uncertainties, the OECD expects the euro area to expand by 1% in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England rugby players who choose to participate in the prospective new breakaway league, R360, may become ineligible to play for the national team. The Rugby Football Union is contractually obligated to select players who play in the Premiership, as per the terms of the new Professional Game Partnership. This means that any player who leaves the Premiership to compete in R360 risks curtailing their international career. The competition is scheduled to launch next year and aims to attract the game's biggest stars, but organizers insist that players will still be able to represent their countries in tournaments. </p>
