          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 flight, which famously turned a potential disaster into a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion. He also flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." Lovell's legacy as a courageous test pilot and astronaut, immortalized in the film "Apollo 13," is remembered for demonstrating remarkable grace under pressure.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in the historic Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, a UNESCO World Heritage site in southern Spain, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. The city's mayor praised the rapid response, stating it "averted a catastrophe" at the major tourist attraction. The blaze reportedly started around 9 p.m. local time in one of the chapels, with preliminary reports suggesting a short circuit in an electrical device as a possible cause. The monument, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century that was later converted into a cathedral, was secured without major structural damage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles-based Spanish-language theater company, Nirvana Theatre, is premiering a new original play titled "CTRL" that delves into the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. The production, which coincides with the company's 10th anniversary, follows four artists in Los Angeles who use a new app that promises to help them succeed, only to find themselves controlled by it. Writer-director Jorge Durán was inspired by the rapid rise of tools like ChatGPT, exploring themes of control and the human element in art. The play aims to reflect the real-life struggles of artists in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by several California district attorneys' offices alleging the retailer overcharged customers. The lawsuit claimed that Walmart violated state laws by selling products, particularly weighted items like produce and baked goods, for higher prices than advertised or for less than their labeled weight. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing and weighing in its California stores. The case was brought forward by prosecutors in four counties.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled a lawsuit over her 2021 termination from "The Mandalorian," which she claimed was due to her conservative social media posts. The article argues the settlement was the right decision, characterizing Disney's initial firing as a fearful overreaction to a hashtag campaign. While Carano's posts were provocative, the author suggests they stemmed more from ignorance than malice and did not warrant the loss of her livelihood. Lucasfilm released a statement praising Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future work, signaling a resolution to the contentious and high-profile dispute.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit, the world's best-selling van, is celebrating its 60th anniversary since its debut on August 9, 1965. Originally a revolutionary vehicle for its time, the Transit became a staple for tradespeople, a tour bus for rock bands like Led Zeppelin, and notoriously, a getaway vehicle for bank robbers. While production moved from the UK to Turkey in 2013, Ford's UK facilities still handle engineering, design, and engine manufacturing. As the brand moves toward an electric future, it faces a more competitive market where the brand loyalty it once commanded is no longer guaranteed.</p>

          <p>An unexpected political friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance is currently on a holiday visit to the UK, which began with a stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, prestigious U.S. college educations, and their Christian faith. This personal relationship is seen as potentially significant in navigating U.S.-UK relations, particularly given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the Trump administration, even as both men have previously made critical comments about Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>A viral claim made by a Facebook user posing as a retired pilot, alleging that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times, has been found to have no evidence. The investigation notes that Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making landings by a plane like Trump's impossible; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. The user who made the claim wore a pilot costume from Amazon in his profile picture and was an administrator for anti-Trump Facebook groups. Trump has publicly denied ever visiting the island, and no credible evidence has emerged to contradict his statement.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened four "warm-hearted convenience stores" as part of an initiative to combat rising social isolation and loneliness among its residents. These centers, designed to feel like warm cafes, offer free ramen, massage chairs, and social activities to provide a welcoming space for people of all ages who feel isolated. The program was prompted by an increase in "lonely deaths" and a study showing nearly 40% of households in the capital are single-person. The initiative has been unexpectedly popular, attracting 20,000 visitors since March, far exceeding the initial projection of 5,000 for the entire year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has started issuing licenses allowing Nvidia to export its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, according to a U.S. official. This move reverses a previous ban and removes a major obstacle for the chipmaker's access to the critical Chinese market, which it had warned would cost billions in sales. The H20 chip was specifically designed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls aimed at slowing Beijing's AI and military development. It is unclear which Chinese companies will be permitted to receive the chips or the total value of the licensed shipments.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley" offers an intimate and honest portrait of the late musician, focusing on the richness of his life rather than a narrative of inescapable doom. Director Amy Berg uses archival material and interviews with close family and friends to explore Buckley's turbulent upbringing, his creative blossoming in New York, and his conflicted feelings about fame. The film thoughtfully handles his death at 30, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than a suicide. The documentary aims to dimensionalize the one-album wonder, providing a deeper understanding of the man behind the iconic voice.</p>
