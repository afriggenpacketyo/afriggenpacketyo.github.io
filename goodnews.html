          <p>The White House has detailed a new agreement for TikTok's U.S. operations that will place its powerful algorithm under American control and ensure a majority of its board seats are held by Americans. The deal, which could be signed in the coming days, positions Oracle to lead the app's data and privacy management, a key demand from U.S. officials concerned about national security. This arrangement with TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, aims to resolve long-standing fears that American user data could be accessed by Beijing. The move follows President Trump's reversal from his initial call for an outright ban of the popular video-sharing platform.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is intensifying over open waters and is forecast to become a hurricane by this weekend. While not expected to make landfall in the United States, its center is projected to pass near Bermuda by early next week, bringing dangerous surf and swells. The National Hurricane Center has advised that these swells will also affect the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward and Atlantic Canada. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, with Gabrielle being only the second storm anticipated to reach hurricane strength.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Achieve Breakthrough in Diamond Manipulation with Lasers, Aiding Fusion Energy Research</h2>

          <p>In a significant advancement for fusion energy research, scientists have successfully induced shock-induced amorphization in diamond capsules for the first time. By using powerful lasers to compress the diamonds, researchers were able to collapse their atomic structure, a process that provides crucial insights into controlling the symmetrical implosions needed to generate nuclear fusion energy. Understanding how pressure and heat affect diamond stability is key to overcoming flaws that currently hinder the process. This breakthrough brings the world a step closer to harnessing fusion, a potentially limitless and clean energy source that could reduce global dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Bruno Fernandes marked his 200th appearance for Manchester United by scoring his 100th goal for the club, helping secure a crucial 2-1 victory against Chelsea. The team captain's performance was highlighted not just by his goal but also by his relentless energy and leadership throughout the match, which manager Ruben Amorim praised as vital to the squad. Despite some criticism this season for his discipline and defensive positioning in a deeper midfield role, Fernandes's commitment remains a cornerstone of the team. The win provides Manchester United an opportunity to build momentum as they seek their first back-to-back Premier League victories under Amorim.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has flown its first NATO air defense mission over Poland in response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. RAF Typhoon jets were deployed as part of the "Eastern Sentry" mission, which aims to bolster the alliance's eastern flank amid escalating tensions. The operation sends a clear signal that NATO airspace will be defended, according to UK Defence Secretary John Healey. This military response follows multiple violations of NATO members' airspace by Russia this month, including incidents involving Romania and Estonia, which have heightened security concerns across the region.</p>

          <h2>UK Liberal Democrats Aim to Reclaim Patriotism from the Far Right</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 15:45:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has launched a campaign to "reclaim patriotism" from nationalist and far-right groups, marked by a flag-draped speech from former leader Tim Farron at their party conference. Farron urged members to embrace national flags and symbols with pride, arguing they should not be co-opted by those who seek to divide the country. This new, more outwardly patriotic strategy is a notable shift for the party, which has traditionally avoided such displays. The move is seen as a direct challenge to figures like Nigel Farage, whom the party has dubbed a "plastic patriot," as they seek to position themselves as the true representatives of British values.</p>

          <h2>Yellowstone Bison Found to Enhance Ecosystem Health Through Grazing Habits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 15:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that the grazing patterns of bison in Yellowstone National Park significantly improve the ecosystem's health, challenging traditional concerns about overgrazing. Scientists discovered that as the large, free-roaming herds graze, they stimulate the nitrogen cycle, resulting in plants that are 150% more nutritious and creating denser, healthier grasslands. This finding highlights the role of bison as "ecosystem engineers" and suggests that restoring large animal migrations can bolster biodiversity and create more resilient landscapes. The study supports broader conservation efforts for the once-endangered species.</p>
