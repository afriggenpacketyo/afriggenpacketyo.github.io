          <p>Several of Sunday's newspapers are leading with the government's new immigration plans, with the Daily Mail reporting that migrants will be warned that committing any crime will result in deportation. The Home Office will be notified of all foreign nationals convicted of any offense, granting officials broader powers to remove them from the UK. The Sunday Express focuses on migrants' lawyers allegedly abusing the system, stating that foreign criminals will not be able to exploit human rights laws under the new government plans, which are described as the biggest overhaul of immigration laws since Brexit.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, was released after a federal judge ordered her immediate release from a detention facility in Louisiana. Ozturk, whose student visa was canceled, was among thousands of international students facing deportation as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education, allegedly aimed at rooting out antisemitism. Ozturk's supporters claim her detention was retaliation for an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands, arguing that it violated her First Amendment rights.</p>
