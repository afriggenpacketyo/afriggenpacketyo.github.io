          <p>As a ceasefire holds in Gaza, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced plans to destroy all remaining Hamas tunnels once the hostage release is complete, an operation to be conducted under US supervision. Concurrently, Egypt is set to host a major international peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, co-chaired by President Trump, with over 20 world leaders attending to finalize the Gaza agreement. However, Hamas has stated it will not participate in the summit, communicating instead through Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The developments coincide with large pro-Palestinian rallies in cities like Sydney and London, marking two years since the war began.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has utilized an advanced AI protein language model to uncover previously hidden links between unrelated species that exhibit similar traits through convergent evolution. This process, where species like bats and dolphins independently develop abilities such as echolocation, has long intrigued scientists. Traditional methods focused on simple sequence similarities, but the new AI approach can analyze complex 3D protein structures. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights an underappreciated sequence basis for how different species arrive at the same functional solution to environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire agreement, preparations are underway to significantly increase humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip, with a target of around 600 trucks per day. As Israeli forces withdraw from some areas, displaced Palestinians have begun returning north, many to find their homes completely destroyed after two years of war. The United Nations has vast quantities of aid ready for delivery pending Israeli clearance, aiming to alleviate a hunger crisis that has caused famine in parts of the territory. Meanwhile, preparations are also being made for the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the comprehensive deal.</p>

In the eastern province of Zhejiang, Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing urged manufacturers to integrate new technologies like artificial intelligence and large language models into their production processes to create "new quality productive forces." He specifically highlighted the importance of supporting specialized firms in niche sectors to drive innovation and increase R&D investment. This push for high-tech development occurred as another official toured a different region to focus on pressing issues such as AIDS prevention and poverty alleviation, reflecting a dual approach to national development.</p>

          <p>Despite having access to elite coaching staff and facilities at their clubs, a growing number of top footballers, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, are hiring private coaches to gain a competitive advantage. These external coaches offer highly personalized, one-on-one sessions focused on fine-tuning specific skills that may not be addressed in a group setting. Coaches like Ryan Hopper analyze a player's match footage to recreate game scenarios and build confidence in areas they want to improve. While some clubs are wary of the injury risks, others collaborate with the private coaches, recognizing that the specialized training can lead to improved on-field performance.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse treacherous terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost zones, with an average elevation above 4,500 meters. The total investment for the project could reach an estimated 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the costliest rail lines ever built in the country. A state-owned company has been established to oversee the construction and operation, which is critical for Beijing's strategic and economic goals in these remote western regions.</p>

          <p>The European Union has started the gradual implementation of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, on their first entry. The rollout is being phased in over six months at different points of entry, including airports and Channel crossings like Dover and the Eurotunnel, with full implementation expected by April 2026. While designed to enhance security and streamline travel long-term, there are concerns about potential delays and queues during the initial registration period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At its party conference, Wales' Plaid Cymru has committed to creating a detailed plan for Welsh independence, though not within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth proposed establishing a "standing commission" to engage the public and prepare a white paper on independence, suggesting it would be a priority for a second term, post-2030. This approach pulls back from a previous pledge to hold a referendum within five years but aims to "kick start the national debate." The party also endorsed pursuing enhanced devolution for Wales, including powers over justice and policing, as part of the journey toward eventual independence.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the upcoming World Cup to "put right" the disappointment of their 2022 play-off defeat to Ukraine. Clarke has successfully led the team to two consecutive European Championships, ending a long major tournament drought, but the failure to reach the Qatar World Cup remains a painful memory. Scotland is currently well-positioned in their qualifying group, level on points with leaders Denmark. A victory over Belarus could secure another play-off spot and move the team closer to its first men's World Cup appearance in 28 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has identified the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a new plant. Published in the journal Cell, their research reveals that flipping two specific genetic switches can induce a somatic (non-reproductive) cell to initiate embryogenesis, a process previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. This discovery provides fundamental insights into plant biology and cellular totipotency, which is the ability of a single cell to differentiate and develop into a complete organism. The findings could have significant implications for agriculture, conservation, and plant biotechnology.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen produced a documentary at Cardiff University's anatomy centre to learn about the process, discovering how donated bodies serve as "silent teachers" for the next generation of doctors. The article explores the emotional impact on families, who may wait up to three years for the return of their loved one's remains for a funeral. Inspired by her mother's wish to give back to the medical community that treated her for cancer, Owen has also decided to register as a body donor.</p>

Ennis, who had long struggled to make the 147-pound limit, appeared stronger and more powerful at the new weight. The decisive victory sets up a highly anticipated future showdown with fellow undefeated contender Vergil Ortiz Jr., a fight promoters are calling one of the best matchups to be made in American boxing.</p>

          <p>Despite breaking goalscoring records for both England and his clubs, questions persist whether striker Harry Kane receives the appreciation his achievements warrant. As England's and Tottenham's all-time leading scorer, his consistency continued at Bayern Munich, where he became the fastest player to score 100 goals for a top European club. Pundits argue that Kane's understated personality and England's lack of major tournament victories may contribute to him being undervalued compared to contemporaries like Erling Haaland. However, they emphasize his all-around game, intelligence, and sustained brilliance, labeling him a "colossus" and one of the world's truly great players.</p>
