        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, a former Conservative councillor, overturned a significant Labour majority in what is seen as a major electoral test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This marks Reform UK's first ever victory in a parliamentary by-election, boosting the party's presence in Parliament to five MPs. The article notes that the Conservative vote collapsed, and Labour officials cited voter frustration with cuts to winter fuel payments and disability benefits as contributing factors to the outcome.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered into a $5.3 billion agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss.

Petrelintide, with its potential for improved tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs, is viewed as a promising asset. The deal involves upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments contingent on clinical trial success and sales performance.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision expected to have significant socio-economic and political implications. This move, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, reflects the government's commitment to societal values. The collection of caste data is likely to fuel demands for increased quotas in government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for Other Backward Classes. The last comprehensive caste census was conducted by British colonial rulers in 1931, and successive Indian governments have resisted updating this data due to concerns about social unrest.</p>
