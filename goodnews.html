          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy startup, successfully priced its IPO at $32 per share, reaching the high end of its projected range and raising approximately $273 million. Founded in 2014, the company offers software-based remote rehabilitation services and will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker 'HNGE'. While its IPO valuation is lower than its previous private market valuation, Hinge Health's revenue has grown significantly, reporting a net income of $17.1 million in the first quarter, a notable turnaround from the previous year. The IPO is being closely monitored as a potential sign of recovery for the digital health sector after a period of slowdown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade commemorating its 250th anniversary, an event coinciding with President Trump's birthday and triggering speculation about its purpose. The parade, which will feature historical reenactors and military displays, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, with additional security expenses expected. The Army plans to mitigate potential road damage by using rubber treads and metal plates, while soldiers will be housed in federal buildings with provided stipends and meals.

          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached an agreement with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to offer copay caps on popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.

Under the new arrangement, employee out-of-pocket costs will be capped at $200 per month, which is less than half of the cash price without insurance. The agreement also includes a simplified pre-authorization process and consistent pricing across retail pharmacies and home delivery services.</p>

          <p>As Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) prepares to reopen near Pacific Palisades following wildfire damage, a dispute has emerged between state and city officials regarding security plans for the area. The California state emergency services agency expressed concerns about the lack of a security plan from Los Angeles, while the city stated that a strict plan would be in place to keep the area closed to non-residents. The affluent coastal enclave has been closed to the public since a devastating wildfire in January, and the reopening of PCH necessitates new checkpoints to maintain restricted access. Traci Park, the Los Angeles city council member representing the Palisades, has also voiced frustration with the lack of clarity.</p>

          <p>Despite inflation, there are several ways to save money on summer vacations, according to a recent analysis. Flight and hotel room rates are down slightly compared to last year, offering opportunities for deals. However, ride-share fares and entertainment costs have increased, so it is important to budget for dining out and vacation activities. To cut down on expenses, travelers should be flexible with travel dates and destinations and consider using credit card points and airline rewards. (not investment advice)</p>

The Green Bay Packers had requested the ban, citing player safety and pace of play, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play.

Norm, a barfly, always answered truthfully and wittily when asked how he was doing, contrasting with the often superficial pleasantries of everyday life. The author suggests that Norm's ability to connect with others and be genuine is a valuable example in a world filled with loneliness and pretense. While 'Cheers' was fictional, the author expresses a desire for the kind of connection and acceptance that Norm found in his barroom.</p>
