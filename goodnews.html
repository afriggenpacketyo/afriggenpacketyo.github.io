          <h2>Financial Planner Suggests Using Effective Tax Rate to Decide Between Pretax and Roth 401(k) Contributions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When choosing between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, savers often compare their current marginal tax rate to their expected future rate, but this may be a flawed approach. Financial planner Cody Garrett suggests focusing on one's effective tax rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of total income—which is often significantly lower than the marginal rate. Because of the progressive tax system and standard deductions, one's effective tax rate in retirement could be much lower than anticipated, potentially making pretax contributions more advantageous than they initially appear.

The company now anticipates annual revenue growth of 7% to 9%, more than doubling its previous forecast of 3% to 4%, and expects earnings per share to grow by at least 15%. This optimism is driven by surging customer demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, including the servers, storage, and networking equipment necessary to deploy AI at scale. Dell, a key customer of Nvidia, is positioning itself as a leader in providing these comprehensive AI solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years, according to a new report. Although the total number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, the overall market was much weaker, leading to a larger investor market share. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, while large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters. This trend indicates that investors are providing crucial liquidity and inventory in a sluggish housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has denied reports that she turned down an offer to perform at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. Speaking on "The Tonight Show," the superstar clarified that while her team has informal conversations with producer Jay-Z's Roc Nation about her general interest, no "official offer" was ever made or rejected. Swift explained that during the football season, her focus is entirely on supporting her fiancé, Travis Kelce, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. She stated she couldn't imagine planning a massive performance while he is competing in such a high-pressure sport, though she noted he would be supportive if she chose to do it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has significantly raised its forecast for global trade volume growth in 2025 to 2.4%, a sharp increase from its previous 0.9% estimate. This upward revision is attributed to factors like U.S. importers front-loading orders ahead of tariff hikes and strong demand for AI-related technology, particularly from Asia. However, the outlook for 2026 has been downgraded, with expected growth slowing to just 0.5% as the global economy cools and the full impact of widespread trade tariffs is felt. The WTO identified the spread of trade-restrictive measures as a key downside risk to its forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya has clarified that her legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules is "never the end," despite recent reports suggesting otherwise. Semenya, who has a difference of sexual development (DSD) resulting in naturally higher testosterone levels, has been fighting regulations that would require her to take hormone-suppressing drugs to compete. Following a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights, she stated her legal team is still finalizing its next steps. She criticized the governing body's policies as "weak leadership" and an unfair imposition of power over athletes with natural biological differences.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their pioneering experiments in quantum mechanics. Their work in the 1980s demonstrated that quantum phenomena, such as "tunneling," where particles pass through seemingly impassable energy barriers, could be observed and controlled in macroscopic electrical circuits. This breakthrough laid the fundamental groundwork for the development of superconducting qubits, which are the basic building blocks of today's powerful quantum computers. The laureates' discoveries have had profound implications for modern technology and the future of computing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 250% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This move reverses a Biden-era decision that had blocked the controversial 211-mile Ambler Road project, which is necessary for the mining operations. The project is seen as crucial for securing U.S. supply chains for resources vital to defense and energy technologies. (not investment advice)</p>
