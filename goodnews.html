          <p>As families gather for Rosh Hashanah, new interpretations of traditional Jewish recipes are gaining prominence, blending heritage with modern culinary creativity. The article highlights individuals like Robin Weiss, who published a cookbook of 17 kugel variations to honor her late grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. It also explores how restaurants are incorporating family recipes like schnitzel onto their menus, reflecting a renewed interest in passed-down dishes. This trend signifies a broader movement of rediscovering and celebrating Jewish culture and history through food, connecting younger generations with their ancestral stories and traditions.</p>

          <h2>Home Equity Loan Costs Analyzed Following Recent Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 13:28:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased, though the change is not dramatic. For an $80,000 loan, a 10-year term now averages around $989 per month, while a 15-year term is about $779 per month. These figures are marginally lower than they were earlier in 2025 and in late 2024, representing a modest saving for homeowners. The article advises homeowners to carefully calculate costs and compare them with alternatives like HELOCs, as further rate cuts expected later this year could make borrowing even more affordable.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that alleged deceptive advertising for its Reese's Halloween-themed candies. The plaintiffs claimed the packaging depicted detailed spooky designs, such as faces on pumpkins and ghosts, that were absent on the actual unwrapped chocolates. However, the judge ruled that the consumers failed to demonstrate concrete economic harm, stating that the candies were not worthless despite their plain appearance. The consumers' attorney has indicated they plan to amend and refile the complaint, arguing that companies should not benefit from false representations.</p>

Originally from a village near Valencia, Spain, Vila began dancing at age four and now runs a program that explores the art form's diverse origins, which include influences from Romani travelers, North African musicians, and Spanish colonies. The dance incorporates international elements like the Peruvian cajón and the Filipino Manton de Manila shawl.

          <h2>Advanced AI Models Can Now Pass the Rigorous Level III CFA Exam</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 13:24:03 EDT</div>

          <p>New research indicates that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the notoriously difficult Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, including the essay-based Level III, in just minutes. A study by NYU Stern and GoodFin found that frontier AI, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus, can handle the high-level analytical reasoning required for the exam, which typically takes humans around 1,000 hours of study. While this technological leap demonstrates AI's growing sophistication in finance, experts believe it will not replace human financial analysts, who provide essential context, intent, and interpersonal understanding.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who was exonerated by DNA evidence after serving 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, has received a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood. His attorneys stated that the lawsuit demonstrated police misconduct, including falsifying evidence and burying information that corroborated Hastings' alibi. The actual perpetrator, who died in prison in 2020 for a separate kidnapping and sexual assault, was identified through the new DNA testing. Hastings expressed that while no money can restore the lost years, the settlement marks an end to his long ordeal.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a rule change that eliminates the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for pattern day traders, a barrier that has been in place since 2001. The new regulation, which awaits SEC approval, will instead base intraday buying power on margin requirements for specific positions, making active trading more accessible to investors with smaller accounts. Regulators stated the overhaul reflects significant advancements in technology and market access since the dot-com era. This change could potentially increase trading activity, particularly in options, benefiting brokerage firms like Robinhood. (not investment advice)</p>

The strategy, heavily influenced by statistical analyst Edoardo Molinari, favors retaining experienced players and ensuring continuity with captain Luke Donald. McGinley emphasizes that while marginal gains are crucial, the primary focus remains on communication and mental preparation for the intense crowd pressure.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. experienced a significant and unexpected 20.5% increase in August, reaching their highest level since early 2022. This surge occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, suggesting that builder incentives and price cuts were a major catalyst. Some analysts, however, urge caution, noting the data is often volatile and subject to revision, and that the magnitude of the jump may be overstated. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a nine-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Texas have been surprised by the appearance of multiple rare "pink meanie" jellyfish washing ashore. This massive species, formally identified in 2011, can have tentacles up to 70 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds. Jace Tunnell of Texas A&M's Harte Research Institute noted that their presence is tied to blooms of their primary food source, the smaller moon jellyfish. Despite their intimidating size and name, which comes from their bright pink color, their sting is reportedly mild. These jellyfish thrive in warm waters and are also found in the Mediterranean and around South Africa.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers. The move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains essential for U.S. interests. (not investment advice)</p>
