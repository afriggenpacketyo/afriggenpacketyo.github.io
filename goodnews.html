The $47.45-per-month plan, named "The 47 Plan" in reference to Trump's current term as the 47th U.S. president, offers unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as roadside assistance and a "Telehealth and Pharmacy Benefit." The company will also sell a "T1" smartphone, which features a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag and displays Trump's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again." This venture is another example of the Trump business capitalizing on its association with the sitting president through a licensing agreement.</p>

          <p>Japan's national football team manager, Hajime Moriyasu, expressed his ambition to win the 2026 World Cup, stating he feels "pressure" but "no stress" in his role. Moriyasu addressed the Japan National Press Club, emphasizing his goal of making Japan the best in the world and challenging for the World Cup. Japan secured their fastest-ever World Cup qualification in March, with three games to spare, and Moriyasu remains confident in his team's ability to succeed. Despite facing criticism for his tactics and player selections, Moriyasu welcomes the scrutiny and likened Real Sociedad attacker Takefusa Kubo to "Captain Tsubasa," hoping he will become a world-class player.</p>

          <p>Florida has removed a record 20 tons of invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades region over the past decade, marking a significant milestone in the state's efforts to control the species. Biologists at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida focus on tracking and removing female pythons during the breeding season using tagged male "scout" snakes and radio telemetry. The efforts have prevented an estimated 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013, but experts acknowledge that complete eradication is unlikely. The state also harnesses public interest through events like the Florida Python Challenge to aid removal efforts.</p>

          <p>Energy efficiency standards, which have historically driven savings, are now facing political scrutiny under the Trump administration. The administration is rescinding dozens of energy-efficiency rules, claiming to save Americans billions, while the Biden administration previously pushed for stricter standards, like those for gas stoves and microwaves. While some argue that stricter standards harm performance, the appliance industry relies on federal guidelines for streamlining expectations. Eliminating these standards could result in higher electricity bills, and the debate centers on balancing energy production with conservation in the face of rising demand from exports and AI data centers.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, implemented in January, has significantly transformed traffic conditions in lower Manhattan, with 70,000 fewer vehicles entering the congestion zone each day.

Traffic crashes and injuries have decreased in areas outside the toll zone, such as Astoria and Long Island City, and noise complaints have dropped along Manhattan's busiest streets.

          <p>Most countries globally have agreed to set their own goals to keep the planet from overheating, putting pressure on them to act. Kenya, for example, has increased its use of renewable energy sources from approximately half of its electricity generation in 2000 to 90% today, and aims to reach 100% renewables by 2035.
