        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the "Quad," have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The move is a direct response to concerns over China's dominance in the processing and refining of these materials, which are essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies. In a joint statement, the group highlighted the risks of relying on a single country, citing potential for economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The initiative aims to diversify supply chains by fostering cooperation among approximately 30 to 40 companies from the four democratic nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, a plan that would have revoked legal status and work permits for Haitians who were previously protected until February 2026 under a Biden-era extension. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan stated that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting that district courts cannot prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a key figure in shaping the cultural landscape of Los Angeles, has passed away at the age of 105. A lawyer, real estate developer, and decorated WWII veteran, Nicholas was instrumental in the development of major city landmarks, including the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. His efforts helped transform L.A. into a global arts hub, earning him the nickname "Mr. Downtown Culture." In addition to his work in the arts, he founded Public Counsel in 1970, which has become the largest pro bono law firm in the United States, providing legal aid to vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that the number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border reached a new historic monthly low in June. Border Patrol recorded just over 6,000 apprehensions, continuing a significant drop in illegal immigration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies. This figure is a stark contrast to the record levels seen under the previous administration, where daily apprehensions sometimes exceeded this monthly total. The administration's border czar, Tom Homan, confirmed the low numbers and noted that for a second consecutive month, no apprehended migrants were released into the U.S. interior.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel has agreed to the conditions for a two-month ceasefire in its ongoing war with Hamas. While details of the proposal were not disclosed, Trump stated that Qatar and Egypt would deliver the final offer to Hamas, urging the group to accept the deal. Neither Israel nor Hamas has publicly commented on the announcement. The statement comes ahead of a planned meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington. Previous efforts to secure a long-term truce have failed, with the 21-month conflict resulting in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the country's most stringent law regulating PFAS, often called "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, known as "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's community was heavily affected by PFAS waste from manufacturing giant 3M, which has since agreed to stop producing the chemicals and pay $850 million for cleanup, though no definitive link was made to her specific illness.</p>

          <p>A new medical technology using powerful magnetic extractors is saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers with complex shrapnel wounds, which now account for up to 80% of battlefield trauma. Developed by a volunteer-led team, these devices allow surgeons to remove metal fragments, even from beating hearts, through minimally invasive procedures. The magnets are strong enough to pull shards through tissue, reducing the need for large, dangerous incisions and speeding up critical operations. This modernized approach to a 19th-century concept has been rolled out across Ukraine, with 3,000 units distributed to frontline medics and hospitals to address the rise in drone-related injuries.</p>

Microsoft's Azure cloud business beat growth expectations, while Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and persistent demand fueled its rally. Meta's strong performance was attributed to its powerful advertising business, which blew past earnings estimates, demonstrating the unique strengths that allowed these three firms to thrive amidst market uncertainty.
