          <p>President Trump announced a doubling of steel tariffs to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh, following his support for a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel. Trump stated the increase would secure the steel industry and also apply to aluminum, taking effect on June 4. The Nippon deal aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania, with Trump touting it as an investment controlled by the U.S. The United Steelworkers union expressed reservations, while U.S. Steel warned of potential job losses without the acquisition; the deal includes protections for workers and facilities, along with a $5,000 bonus for employees (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following John Mellencamp's criticism of Pat McAfee's explicit speech hyping up Indiana Pacers fans, Pacers legend Reggie Miller appeared to show support for Mellencamp. McAfee's speech during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals drew Mellencamp's disapproval, leading to a response from McAfee on X. Miller then posted a video montage of him greeting Mellencamp, emphasizing Mellencamp's importance to Indiana, further fueling the apparent divide.

The images were originally commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for discredited research aiming to prove white superiority.

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to that granted to legislative and executive branches. They claim prosecuting Dugan threatens public trust in the judicial system and would stifle independent decision-making by judges.</p>
